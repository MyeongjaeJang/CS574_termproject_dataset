The rich settlement of Sandby Borg was suddenly annihilated 1,500 years ago, and now the researchers working on the dig have got a better idea of what happened. 
Helena Victor, archaeologist at Kalmar County Museum and head of the project, thinks it is no accident that this attack on the Baltic island of Ã–land happened at the same time as the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the invasions and migrations from the East. 
The people of this area had benefited from trading with Romans, maybe serving in the imperial armed forces, but that connection with the rich south was disrupted. 
The injuries inflicted on the skeletons can also tell us a lot about what happened and why, says archaeologist and osteologist Clara Alfsdotter. Loukas Christodoulou
