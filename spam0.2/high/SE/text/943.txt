Munch Museum upgrades with building automation Oslo, Norway 
The Oslo City Administration has selected Siemens to provide the building management system and building automation for the new Munch Museum. Siemens will install the Desigo CC building management platform in the arts museum of the Norwegian capital, together with all associated automation equipment, panels and the necessary interfaces, engineering, programming, commissioning and training of museum employees. 
“The mission of the new Munch Museum is to preserve valuable art exhibits safely and appropriately for perpetuity. Therefore, all such contracts are very important to us,” says Eli Grimsby, director of the City of Oslo’s culture and sports facilities. 
Desigo CC will control virtually every discipline in the building and provide a better overview and easier operation. The planning and design phase has already started, and the project is expected to be completed late 2019. The order is valued at more than 1.1 million euros. 
The customer has involved Siemens as the supplier at an early stage in the project. This early integration results in a better overall solution because it helps avoid weaknesses in the technical systems from the early phase. 
“We are very proud to have won this contract. It shows that we have the expertise and solutions at the right price. The Munch Museum and Campus As at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU), which we won before the summer holidays, are large and coveted contracts in a very competitive market,” says Helge Rysjedal, sales manager at Siemens Norway.
