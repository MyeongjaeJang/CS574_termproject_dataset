Full House with David Crawley April 10, 2018   
Came across this poker themed portrait with vertical safety climber/mountaineer David Crawley shot in the old studio a few years ago. I have no idea why poker, but it might have something to do with the beautiful card table with green fllt that I borrowed from artist, Johan “Giovanni” Carlsten.
