Yanmar extends its engine line up to 155 kW Published Today at 10:44 Yanmar has chosen Intermat to launch its most impressive line-up development for 20 years. Not just one, but two brand new engine families will be officially introduced at the show, extending Yanmar’s current power range up to 155 kW. The smaller engine family being launched at Intermat is a 3.8L displacement engine, 4TN101, which lines up in the 55-105kW power range with torque up to 550Nm. The larger engine grouping, 4TN107, has a 4.6l displacement with power ratings ranging from 90-155kW and torque exceeding 805 Nm. Both feature a common rail injection system, full authority electronics and after cooled turbocharging (with a two stage turbo on the 4TN107 upper ratings). Specific power and torque are among the highest available in the market. Both engine families will be EU Stage V certified, and share the same design target of reducing the total cost of ownership. Yanmar’s efforts have been focused on setting new fuel economy targets, leveraging Yanmar’s extensive know how in combustion process optimisation gained through its experience in diesel engines for industrial equipment and marine vessels. Superior durability and robustness on one side, with compactness, high power and torque density on the other, have been jointly achieved to fulfil the requirements of the designated applications, i.e. construction, materials handling and agriculture. Production is planned to start from the beginning of 2019 onwards. The engines can be seen on the Yanmar stand at Intermat: Stand numberE46.Hall 5A.
