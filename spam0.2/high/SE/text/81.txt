Press Room Explanation of Vote delivered on behalf of Sweden at the UN Security Council Adoption on MONUSCO Explanation of Vote delivered by Ambassador Carl Skau on behalf of Sweden at the United Nations Security Council Adoption on the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, MONUSCO, 27 March 2018, New York. 
Mr President, 
We welcome the adoption of today's resolution and we thank France for their work in facilitating the Council's work.2018 is a crucial year for the DRC. It is clear that MONUSCO has a critical role to play.A decisive step towards peace and stability will be the holding of credible, transparent, inclusive and peaceful elections on the 23 of December, with the ensuing democratic transfer of power as per the constitution and the 31 December agreement. MONUSCO has now been tasked to support the DRC with logistical support, technical support and good offices in this endeavor, including ensuring the participation, involvement and representation of women at all levels.The mission is also tasked to protect civilians through a comprehensive approach, making better use of early warning and early responses including prevention, but also by improving its military response.In all of this, the mission needs to be adequately resourced.Let me also take this opportunity to underline the important role of relevant regional organisations and neighbouring countries in ensuring an environment for credible elections. We look forward to continue to engage regional actors to facilitate united Council action in support of such efforts.Thank you.
