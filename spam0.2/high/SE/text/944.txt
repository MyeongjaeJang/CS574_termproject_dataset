Good day babes!! So this is so wierd… I got to bed around 02 yesterday and was a bit unsure if I would be able to get up at 08 in the morning like I’ve planned to.. but guess what? I woke up BY MYSELF AT 06.15 with loads of energy! So wierd! I mean.. what happened to the jetlag?? Well.. I’m happy haha. I made breakfast, ate it and watched “The people VS O.J” that I’ve started watching again. It’s just crazy.. have you seen it? I mean – OFC HE DID IT! WTF! All the evidence against him! That he actually was freed from it is just crazy. Just crazy. I remember when I saw it when it came out and I started reading all articles and everything about the crime, their background, the trial. everything. If you haven’t watched it – do it! I’ve seen the documentary too. Anyway.. i’m just about to hit the shower and get ready for today. It’s going to be 20 degrees celsius today(!!) so I’m meeting up with Simon for lunch in the sun and a stroll at Djurgården. YEY FINALLY SPRING! OR…?
