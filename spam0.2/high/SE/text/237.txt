So time to fly home from Istanbul. As usual Iâ€™m in good time before departure so I can enjoy Turkish Airlines flagship lounge. As you can see below the lounge is fantastic and I headed direct to the sweets. 
The only thing that made me upset was that there was a sign saying star alliance gold at fast track but it was just valid for members in Tukish Airlines own frequent flyer program. Share this:
