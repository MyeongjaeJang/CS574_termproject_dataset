Honor 10 unveiled with Kirin 970 chipset to power the AI of the dual camera 19. априла 2018. 3 
Huawei just unveiled the Honor 10 and put it on pre-order straight away. The phone sets out to be a slightly more affordable version of the Honor View 10, though not quite as cheap as expected – it’s priced CNY 2,600 while the View 10 is CNY 2,800. Huawei Honor 10 
The Honor 10 is built around a 5.84” screen with a notch on top and an aspect ratio of 19:9. It’s an IPS LCD panel with 1,080 x 2,280px resolution (432ppi pixel density). The fingerprint reader below the screen is a Huawei tradition. 
The phone packs a high-end chipset – the Kirin 970 used in the P20 flagships. And it even has more RAM than the base P20 model, a healthy 6 GB. The storage is pretty decent too – 64 GB – but there’s no microSD card slot. If that’s not enough, there’s a 128 GB model too. Android 8.1 Oreo with EMUI 8.1 will be installed out of the box. 
The dual camera on the back features a 16 MP color sensor (and f/1.8 aperture) and a 24 MP black white sensor. The selfie camera has a 24 MP sensor and an f/2.0 fixed-focus lens, which will be used for iPhone-like portrait photos. 
As the label on the back will tell you, both cameras feature AI smarts to automatically tune the image. On the video side, the main camera shoots 4K while the selfie cam does 1080p. 
The Honor 10 packs a 3,400 mAh battery with 4.5A fast charge over USB-C. That’s a whopping 22.5 W of charging power (50% charge in 25 minutes). And the USB-C port (wired for USB 2.0) is not alone on the bottom of the phone, next to it is a 3.5 mm headphone jack with an AK4376A 32-bit DAC and Huawei Histen technology. 
The Honor 10 is on pre-order now for CNY 2,600 ($415/€335) for the 64 GB model and CNY 3,000 ($480/€390) for the 128 GB one, sales begin tomorrow. It’s a dual-SIM phone available in Mirage Purple, Mirage Blue, Black and Grey. The Mirage colors feature a cool gradient, similar to the Twilight option of the P20.
