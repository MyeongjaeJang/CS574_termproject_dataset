Charlotte Mecklenburg Library Offers Free Financial Education with Money Smart Week Tue, Apr 17, 2018 20:00 CET 
Charlotte Mecklenburg Library is joining libraries and financial institutions across the country in Money Smart Week, April 21-28, 2018, with the aim of helping everyone get smart about their personal finances. 
Money Smart Week is the broadest and most comprehensive financial educational program in the country. Started in 2002 in Chicago with just 40 programs, it has expanded significantly to become the only national educational program for people at all stages of life. 
According to exit surveys, most participants indicate they are likely to change the way they manage their money after attending a Money Smart Week program. 
This is the third year the Library has partnered with this national effort, which fits in with the Library's mission to improve lives and build a stronger community. 
Money Smart Week kicks off with a celebration at ImaginOn, Saturday, April 21 from 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. The day will start with a financial literacy-themed storytime in Spangler Library, followed by a presentation by Money Smart Week partners who will share information and allow for parents to ask financial-related questions. 
Visit your Library for more financial-themed storytimes for children and free personal finance programs for adults.
