Avigilon expands Avigilon Blue Platform Vancouver, Canada 
Avigilon Corporation, a Motorola Solutions company, is expanding the Avigilon Blue platform with the preview of the Avigilon Control Center (ACC) System Health Monitoring service at ISC West 2018 this week in Las Vegas. 
The new ACC System Health Monitoring service is designed to help Avigilon’s Partners proactively monitor and maintain the performance of their customers’ ACC systems. It will feature an easy-to-use dashboard with event warnings that enable remote diagnosis of server and camera status. Avigilon’s Partners will be able to check in on customer sites without having to deploy a technician and assess health notifications prior to arriving on site, saving valuable time and resources so they can support more customer sites. 
Our Partners have tremendous success deploying ACC systems and this new service will add even more value and opportunity for them,” said James Henderson, Avigilon’s President and Chief Operating Officer. “Through the Avigilon Blue platform, we’re providing our Partners with a simple and effective way to centrally manage their ACC sites, ensuring they are regularly maintained and running smoothly.” 
The ACC System Health Monitoring service will be available with the upcoming Avigilon Control Center 6.10 video management software and activated with an Avigilon Blue subscription. It is expected to be available in the second quarter of this year. Email:
