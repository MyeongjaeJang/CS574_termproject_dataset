PICTURES FROM ZARA LARSSON’S B-DAY PARTY SOME WEEKENDS AGO 
Saturday and i’m staying in tonight! I went to my naprapath ( and first of all: my friend) Emilia yesterday so my back is so sore today! Had a good time yesterday celebrating Julian & Rami ♥ I was sober and went home pretty early and crashed to bed. Started this morning with a brunch at Mahalo with my babygirl Michelle followed by vintage-hunting for some stuff for Coachella! I’ll wear mostly clothes from the brand I’m going with but needed some accessories and so on. Then I had lunch with Amir followed by rehersal for tomorrow – recording our second dance tomorrow for insta!! woop woop!
