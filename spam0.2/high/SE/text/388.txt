Donut or Google Home Mini? Share Retailers are perennially complaining about the cost of staging elaborate promotions for little return other than perhaps a measure of renewed customer loyalty and some press coverage. 
With this in mind perhaps, the grande dame of Paris’ Left Bank, Le Bon Marché , has just come to the end of a storewide ‘exhibition’ that it called ‘Let’s Go Logo’ (possibly a pun on Let’s Go Loco, although this is not made explicit). 
Brands stocked by the store were invited to revisit their logos and come up with alternatives, whether by plundering their brand signature back catalogue or by doing something completely new. The outcome was 130 different takes on the workaday brand presence of some of the biggest names in fashion, from Céline to Chanel. 
And give that Le Bon Marché was playing host, the logos supporting La Grande Epicerie and of the department store itself were also reworked for the occasion. 
The ‘promotion’ finished on Sunday and although there will have been a price tag attached to the whole, by making suppliers do some of the work, it may have been contained.
