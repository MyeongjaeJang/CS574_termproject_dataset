FIND THE DRESS – HERE (adlink) 
When I wore this dress at Kenza’s & Aleks wedding I got SOO MANY questions on where to get it. It’s from asos but was already sold out and hasn’t been back in stock either. BUT, then I found this dress today and I have to say it’s pretty similar! So I just wanted to share that with you guys that are still looking for my dress or a similar one ♥
