LG K9 debuts, is just a rebranded K8 (2018) for Russia 24. марта 2018. 7 
Earlier this month LG showed the K8 (2018) at the MWC in Barcelona and now, it’s launching it in Russia under the name LG K9. 
Outside of the name nothing appears to have changed. The LG K9 has a 5-inch IPS LCD of the conventional 16:9 aspect and 720x1280px resolution, a 2,500mAh battery, 8MP main cam and a 5MP selfie one. 
The phone is still powered by Android 7.1 and offers LTE connectivity. 
Pushing the price down is the use of a Snapdragon 210 chip and 2GB of RAM. However the built-in 16GB of storage is expandable and there is a fingerprint reader on the back. 
Here’s a quick look at the LG K8 (2018) at the Mobile World Congress earlier this month.
