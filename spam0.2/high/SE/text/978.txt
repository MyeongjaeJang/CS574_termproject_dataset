So yes, many people have contacted me or commenting on my insta on WHERE my tulle skirt is from! I found this little gem in a store called Eden Garden in LA and I couldn’t be MORE HAPPY! I just saw it hanging there all by itself and I just knew it was MINE haha :) I got that Rihanna vibe of it when I saw it and I knew right away how I wanted to style it. It’s such a perfect piece to wear at a festival like Coachella, a gala or a photoshoot. Don’t you agree? Well I’m very happy I found it! Anyway, it’s my favorite day today – SUNDAY! Me, André and our friends went to Enzo last night and had a cozy dinner before André started DJ:ing then followed by a quick stop-by at LE! to say hi to Sabri and Fang. I was sober so around 02 I got so tired so we went back to our hotel ( Surprised André this weekend with a weekend staying at HOBO hotel! ) with some food. Today we haven’t done much actually.. I’ve just been so tired because of all the pollen in the air. It always knocks me out .. gah. But we are thinking about heading out to grab a coffee, have a stroll before heading to the gym. I’m so happy to be back there!! 1 week without been able to workout when you have the best flow in your life sucks. I hate getting sick! Tonight I guess we’ll just chill at the hotel, eat dinner and watch some movies. LOVE! Stay tuned for MY COACHELLA VLOG COMING UP TONIGHT!
