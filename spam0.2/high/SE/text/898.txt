Avigilon previews new video intercom entry system Vancouver, Canada 
Avigilon Corporation, a Motorola Solutions company, recently previewed its new H4 Video Intercom secured entry system at ISC West 2018. 
The H4 Video Intercom integrates a 3 MP camera with a high-performance intercom and features exceptional wide dynamic range, low-light, noise reduction and echo-cancelling technologies for clear viewing and two-way communication with visitors. 
Designed to help improve security and simplify everyday operations for security staff, the H4 Video Intercom is well-suited for applications such as retail stores, offices, hotels, and educational facilities. Combined with Avigilon Control Center video management software, this secured entry system enables operators to quickly and easily identify and communicate with a visitor before remotely granting access. 
"For facilities like school campuses, securing main entry points is critical,” said James Henderson, Avigilon’s President and Chief Operating Officer. “We created the H4 Video Intercom so operators have a unified system to quickly communicate with and visually identify visitors before unlocking a door, or instantly locking down an entire facility.” 
The H4 Video Intercom is expected to be available for order in the second quarter of this year. Email:
