Now I want to call BGG “Ramsey” Darnel April 9, 2018, 11:52 am | # | Reply 
I’m glad they are still there,… I thought the death of the demon lord would remove her being divided. :p April 9, 2018, 1:22 pm | # | Reply 
the fact what GG had to get a new separated ID for BGG…. is what she might be here for the long run RBZ April 9, 2018, 4:25 pm | # | Reply 
But will she stick the the LOSRHs, leave ‘em for Distractella, Evil Savant and Cat-A-Pult, or go it alone? infinityd4 April 13, 2018, 2:14 am | # | Reply 
I don’t know being around BGG might bring up bad blood about her blowing Distracterlla’s chances with LP. IronFox April 9, 2018, 7:46 pm | # | Reply 
Note to self: Let GGG test first, THEN BGG. Better yet, skip BGG altogether. Anything you do for/with her may trigger violence even on the off chance that she actually likes it. Peter Wolff April 9, 2018, 9:59 pm | # | Reply 
GG and BGG seem to get along with each other surprisingly well. 
Even considering they’re alter egos of each other: http://superredundant.com/?comic=262-altruism 
Maybe GG is finding her peace with her dark side and BGG with her bright side. Together they might be the strongest super in Shitropolis (superneutral, neither hero nor villain). Or, as BGG has proven to be more fun-seeking than evil, a super-distractable supersemihero. Brian April 10, 2018, 4:17 am | # | Reply 
Ironically, they never got a chance to actually talk to each other… Maybe THAT did the trick. Drakkenmensch April 10, 2018, 12:20 pm | # | Reply 
BGG seems to me to fit the bill as a Byronic Hero. Darnel April 10, 2018, 11:23 am | # | Reply 
I wonder,…. can they take turns being BGG? 
Understand that they were “Meh” girls when first divided, showing not much in the way of GG or BG, until one of them took both halos. Continuity April 10, 2018, 7:35 pm | # | Reply 
That would make for a hella funny strip. BGG sleeping in her bed, middle of the night. GG sneaks in, swaps the halo onto BGG – then BGG slips out the window to paint the town red, while GG sleeps on in the bed…. GUIGUI April 12, 2018, 9:47 am | # | Reply 
GG is to good to swap the halo on BGG. She only do this has last resort to stop a villain from committing major crimes.
