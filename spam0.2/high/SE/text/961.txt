LG Q7 receives FCC certification 22. априла 2018. 3 
The LG Q7 is methodically gathering the certifications needed before official launch. After it became clear a couple of days ago that it’s been certified in Russia alongside the G7, the Q7 has now cleared the US FCC – or at least that’s what we’re making of the ZNF Q7 10TS model name that’s popped up in the regulator’s database. 
Details on the handset’s specs have been scarce, and that’s not going to change with this FCC filing. Occasionally, we’ve been lucky and the FCC ID location in the menus has revealed something like battery capacity, but not today. In any case, if the G6/Q6 pair is any indication, we’re expecting a significantly cheaper G7 lookalike with midrange internals. And hopefully no ThinQ in the name – imagine a ThinQ7. 
As usual, such developments serve mainly to prove a phone’s existence and its nearing announcement, though there’s obviously nothing along the lines of a time frame.
