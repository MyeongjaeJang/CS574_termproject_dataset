Anders Hesselbom Feel-bad movie: Excision 
Excision is an excellent and very beautifully made movie about a seriously misunderstood girl. Pauline (AnnaLynne McCord) is living in the shadow of her sister Grace (Ariel Winter). The film portraits her breaking away from the high expectations put upon her, with a worst possible ending. 
Beautiful performances from Malcolm McDowell, Traci Lords and Ray Wise! Post navigation
