LUNCH IN DUBLIN 
Yesterday we ended up at The Curch reataurant which wasn’t good at all unfortunately :( the location was cool but the food was terrible and the fact that they started playing s per loud musci at 9 so we couldn’t speak to eachother. Nah, not good. Today we are heading out on a little adventure out at the countryside so that’s fun!! Looking forward to it :D <3 Talk to you later!
