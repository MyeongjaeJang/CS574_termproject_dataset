The 31-year-old graffiti artist was accused of scrawling on the Triton Fountain in Valletta, which was only reopened after a €4.5 million restoration project in January. 
Appearing in front of the magistrate wearing "shiny gold shoes and with a cigarette perched behind his ear", the not-so-lagom-sounding Swede pleaded guilty and sarcastically said "I messed up your streets. I’m sorry," according to Malta Today . 
Warned that a one-month prison sentence is only suspended on the condition that he pays €150 to the Maltese government within three months, he laughed and remarked "shit happens" while making a peace sign, the Maltese site reports.
