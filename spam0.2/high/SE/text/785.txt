Pressmeddelande This is the email I hoped to never have to write. In three and half years, we went from a crazy dream to being all over the news. We built some of the most incredible robots the world has ever seen and pulled off some insane stunts along the way. But, MegaBots was started by a bunch of engineers. We knew how to build robots, but we didn't know how to build an entertainment company. Ultimately, we didn't sell enough t-shirts, sign enough sponsorships, and book enough appearances to pay for additional robots or the staff to build them. Now, the staff is gone and the robots are in a dirty warehouse in Oakland. There is a small glimmer of hope. The hard part of creating the sports league of the future is already done. We built a worldwide brand, and we built the robots. People know about MegaBots all over the world, thanks to our first fight being an international affair. The investors are giving me one last shot. I raised $200,000 to give this one last go. That might seem like a lot of money, but Eagle Prime cost $2.5M to build. And, after paying the bills, that $200K will last around 9 months unless I can start proving that people want to see Giant Fighting Robots. Not only that, they want to see them so badly they're willing to spend money. This is the start of Season 2 of our YouTube channel. I'm doing this behind-the-scenes style, where you will either get to: A) Watch me re-build the team and revive this audacious operation. All while creating a series of live events and public stunts that you can actually attend. OR
