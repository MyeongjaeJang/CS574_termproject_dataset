Sponsorship and Community engagement 
Scania is a global business. That is why we see it as our responsibility to act in different situations and problems that appear wherever we are based. These may be situations that do not necessarily have anything to do with transport â€“ but which nonetheless can deeply can affect the community of which we are a part. If the wider society has problems, we will find it hard to inspire people to think about transport solutions. Where do we engage? 
All business is local even though we live in a global world. Local problems and situations might appear suddenly and we are no strangers to helping out in the aftermath of natural disasters, and helping to prevent the spread of diseases.
