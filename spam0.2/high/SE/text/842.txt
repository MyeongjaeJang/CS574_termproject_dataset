Wednesday's proceedings will focus on what happened inside the store on April 7th 2017. In police hearings several witnesses described how the shelves began to collapse and objects fell. The prosecutor in the case considers terror suspect Rakhmat Akilov to also be guilty of 15 cases of causing danger to another person over what happened around the crash site, labelled "zone F" in the investigation.
