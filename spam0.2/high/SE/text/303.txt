AstraZeneca and Merck & Co (MSD) have announced that the European Medicines Agency has validated for review the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for Lynparza (olaparib) for use in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA-mutated, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer who have been previously treated with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic setting. The first regulatory submission for a PARP in breast cancer in Europe 
This is the first regulatory submission for a poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor in breast cancer in Europe. If approved, the identification of a patient’s BRCA status could become a critical step in the management of their disease alongside current consideration of their hormone receptor and HER2 status. The MAA includes data from the randomised, open-label, Phase III OlympiAD trial, which investigated Lynparza versus chemotherapy (physician’s choice of capecitabine, eribulin or vinorelbine). In the trial, Lynparza significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with chemotherapy and reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 42% (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.43-0.80; P=0.0009 median 7.0 vs. 4.2 months). 
In January 2018, Lynparza was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment of BRCA-mutated HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, becoming the first PARP inhibitor to be approved beyond ovarian cancer. Lynparza is available in nearly 60 countries and has been used to treat more than 20,000 patients.
