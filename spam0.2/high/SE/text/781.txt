Caterpillar expands EU Stage V and U.S. EPA Tier 4 Final industrial engine range Published Today at 10:41 Caterpillar is to add to its extensive industrial engine range with the Cat® C13B. The 12.5l engine has been designed to meet Stage V and Tier 4 final emission standards, with the 6 cylinder, 12.5l engine combining upgraded air, electrical and after treatment systems and is 30% lighter compared to previous models. “Our customers expect reliability and durability, but they need it from a simpler, lighter package with more power and that’s what we’re giving them with our new engines,” explains product manager for 7.2-18l engines, Jeff Moore, who added: “The C13B and all Cat industrial engines are designed with the customer in mind. We meet emission standards while delivering increased power density, fuel efficiency, and reduced complexity to add real value for our customers.” Caterpillar will also certify its existing Stage IV, Tier 4 Final engines in its C13, C15 and C18 product range to meet Stage V emission standards. Dual label certification – Stage V and Tier 4 Final - will be offered for its range of 9-18l products giving customers the opportunity to standardise across regions. As with all Caterpillar 9-18l engines, the C13B will be offered in a number of configurations to provide OEM customers with the flexibility to reduce the cost of installation.
