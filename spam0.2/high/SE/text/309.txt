Launches 03 Apr 2018 | Tokyo Hotel Koe Opens in Japan Follow us Share Hotel Koe , a new lifestyle hotel, has opened in Tokyo’s Shibuya district. 
More than just a place to stay, the three-level hotel also features a bakery restaurant and fashion concept store. 
The new hotel is located in the former site of a shopping centre that now has the hotel on the first three floors, with offices above. Hotel Koe has just 10 guest rooms on the third floor with the rooms coming in four sizes from S to XL. The XL size also features the traditional Tatami matted room. 
The second floor houses the hotel’s flagship store, which sells clothes and lifestyle products. The ground floor has the hotel’s reception, a bakery restaurant and an event venue. 
The interior design has been created by local outfit Suppose Design Offices and has fused modern urban elements with traditional Japanese culture. Grey concrete, corrugated iron and exposed ceilings dominate the space, which is broken up by a large wooden staircase that knits the area together. 
Hotel Koe is part of new movement of destination hotels like Muji and the Hoxton hotels, which are creating destinations where rooms are secondary.
