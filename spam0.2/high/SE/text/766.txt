German demolition conference ‘optimistic’ Published Today at 14:12 Organised by the German demolition association (Deutscher Abbruchverband), the 24th German demolition conference again proved to be a valuable event to its attendees and exhibitors. Held at the Hotel Maritim in Berlin on the 1 and 2 March, the conference attracted almost a thousand participants and 115 exhibitors, mainly from Germany, but also with representatives from other European countries. This made it the largest annual demolition event in Europe this year, with the conference showing that the German demolition industry is currently in very good shape. “Since 2017, business is good and also prices are good. So our members are very satisfied at the moment,” said Deutscher Abbruchverband managing director Andreas Poscha. As is per usual, the demolition conference had no special theme, but instead a comprehensive mixture of topics were discussed. Additionally there were reports about interesting demolition job sites, as well as presentations on subjects including technical norms, laws and regulations, and handling and recycling of hazardous waste. The key speaker this year was Michael Groschek, the former state minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, who talked about his vision of future living and building, and opportunities presented for the demolition industry. Amongst the other 15speakers was Nathanaël Cornet-Phillippe, president of the French demolition association, who explained how a bucket wheel excavator was dismantled on the river Seine.
