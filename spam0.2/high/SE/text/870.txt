Evenemang / Brexit: What will be the costs for Sweden and Stockholm? Launch of a new study apr 20 2018 Brexit: What will be the costs for Sweden and Stockholm? Launch of a new study 20 April Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, Brunnsgatan 2, Stockholm Internationell handel Welcome to the launch of a new study on the consequences and costs of Brexit for Stockholm and Sweden. The Stockholm Chamber of Commerce has together with Oxford Economics analyzed the economic impact of Brexit. 
The report provides answers to questions such as how Brexit will affect Swedish industries and how many Swedish jobs that are at stake. What are the economic impacts on the Stockholm capital region and which sectors will bear the largest burden of Brexit? 
The minister for EU Affairs and Trade, Ann Linde, will give her comments on the report and present her view on the current Brexit negotiations and the future trade relationship between the UK and Sweden. Jan-Olof Jacke, CEO of AstraZeneca, and Anna Malmhake, CEO of The Absolut Company Pernod Ricard, will present their views and discuss the challenges ahead. 
The UK is one of the most important partners for Sweden and the Stockholm capital region. Despite the strong commercial and economic relationship between the UK and Sweden, we have still very little understanding of what Brexit will actually cost. The report and the seminar will bridge this gap. 
Welcome!
