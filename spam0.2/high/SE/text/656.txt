Home 8 Year Anniversary 
You could do a lot of important and meaningful stuff in 8 years. I havn’t. But I’ve done this and it’s at least something. It’s my ambition to have quality over quantity, to not use clickbait, to have very few ads and no fake photos. I hope you can appreciate that and that I’ve given you some entertainment throughout these years. 
If you want to support this poorly named project and keep me going for another year I have a few suggestions. Donate a dollar below and help me pay for it. Follow me on Twitter and retweet some of my stuff. Share a link to the page somewhere so more people can waste a few hours browsing photos and getting nostalgic. Or just tell me in the comments how I can improve or what celebrities you want to see. 
Thanks a lot for visiting! Donate to This Is Not Porn 2018 If you want to support me and keep this site alive, a small donation would be much helpful and greatly appreciated. It would help me to pay for the web hosting and domain name (≈$400/year) and maybe let me buy a coffee or two. As thanks, if you donate $5 or more, you can get a link to your site or Twitter/Instagram or whatever you want, in the list of donors below. Thanks! (I can only accept donations through Paypal at the moment.) Donors
