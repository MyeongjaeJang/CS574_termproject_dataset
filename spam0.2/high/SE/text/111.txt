FORGOTTEN AUSSIE PICTURES 
I’m sooo stressed haha. Nah not really but yeah.. my camera hasn’t arrived yet and I just want it to come before we leave for Dublin on thursday!! Keep your fingers crossed for me babes!! I just want to get going with taking phot s. GAH! Anyway.. I’m so stoked for Dublin actually. I’ve never been to Ireland before so I think we’ll have a kick-ass time :) Thinking about maybe doing a meet-up or something if we have time. I didn’t know I had so many followers there hihi ♥ Have any of you been to Ireland or are you guys from there? Let me know the best spots for brunch/lunch or dinner – or fun things to do! LOVE PS. We had some MAJOR ISSUES with the Aussie vlog cause there was loads of video clips missing and being mysteriously deleted.. so, so wierd! So stay tuned for the workout vlog instead ( tomorrow!). DS.
