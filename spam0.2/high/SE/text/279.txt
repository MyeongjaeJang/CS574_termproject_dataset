The avalanche occurred at 14:00 on Tuesday, moving from the Sielmatjåkka peak towards the Nallostugan mountain lodge, which lies just east of the popular Kungsleden hiking trail in northern Sweden. 
A large mountain rescue operation took place once the alarm was raised, with Norway sending an air ambulance and avalanche dogs to help. A Norwegian man in his 60s was the only person hurt. 
"He got stuck under the snow and his companions pulled him up and started life-saving measures," David Levy from Norrbotten police told news agency TT. 
"It's a good bit out, so it takes a while before all resources are at the scene." 
The man was taken to hospital but was later declared dead. 
According to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency's avalanche forecast, there is a significant risk of avalanche in the Kebnekaise range at present – three on a five-degree scale.
