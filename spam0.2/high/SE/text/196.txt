Frida Nilsson, one of Sweden’s most respected chefs, and Jeppe Appelin, a wine connoisseur and owner of one of Skåne’s boutique wineries and myself have joined forces this Easter weekend and produced an event focused on; fine food, fine wine and fine art photography. The exhibit is in the small seaside village of Vejbystrand (about an hour north of Malmö) at Jeppe’s cozy wine tasting local and right beside his small vineyard at Vejby Vingård .
