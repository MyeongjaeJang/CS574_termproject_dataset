RBS 70 NG Excels at Defexpo Wed, Apr 11, 2018 02:30 CET 
At this years Defexpo India, Saab will display and demonstrate its Very Short-Range Air Defence (VSHORAD) missile system RBS 70 NG. This next generation ground-based air defence (GBAD) system provides a flexible and supremely effective, long-term answer to constantly evolving air defence requirements. 
Standing true to its commitment to team up with India for its defence and security requirements and development of indigenous defence industry, Saab will exhibit its RBS 70 NG to the visitors at this year’s Defexpo India. 
“We are really looking to forward to bringing the RBS 70 NG to India and Defexpo. It is a completely new system featuring state-of-the-art technology, with a Command Line of Sight guidance technology that is superior to competing fire-and-forget systems. I am sure the visitors at Defexpo will recognise this when visiting our stand for a demonstration,” says Jan Widerström, c hairman and Managing Director, Saab India Technologies. 
By utilising state-of-the-art components and technology, the RBS 70 NG is unaffected by countermeasures, heat sources and clutter, providing a highly versatile air defence system. 
“A homing missile can always be jammed by decoys and flares. With our system, you have control of the missile while it is in the air. The clever parts are on the ground and don’t get destroyed with each firing, so the cost is lower over time. In situations like event protection the system gives you control at all times. If you fire a missile and discover the target is not the enemy, you can abort it,” says Dr Bo Almqvist, Director Strategic Business Project at Saab business area Dynamics. 
The RBS 70 NG will be displayed and demonstrated by Saab at Defexpo 2018 in Hall 3, Stand 2.1A
