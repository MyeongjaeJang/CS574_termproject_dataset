Our co-founder James Savage explains how it all started. 
Dear Reader, 
Here at The Local we've been bringing news to Sweden's international crowd for more than a decade. 
Paul Rapacioli and I created The Local in Sweden in 2004 after we saw that there was a hunger from people in the international community for reliable news and information about the society they lived in, or were otherwise connected to. What started in a cramped room in Stockholm now serves 5 million people in nine countries. 
We and the many talented people we have worked with since have made it our lives' work to serve this community, whether it's in Germany , Sweden , France or one of the other six countries The Local now works in.
