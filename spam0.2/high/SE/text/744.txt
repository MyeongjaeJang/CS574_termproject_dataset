Press Room More women on the internet thanks to WikiGap The global #WikiGap initiative has so far generated around 3 000 new or expanded biographies of prominent women on Wikipedia. More than 1 600 participants in more than 50 countries have been involved in WikiGap events, writing articles about women in more than 30 languages. Now all the material needed to organise a WikiGap event is being published in the hope that the project will live on through other actors. 
WikiGap is an initiative during which people around the world gather to add more content to Wikipedia about women profiles, experts and role models in various fields. Starting on 8 March 2018 – International Women's Day – the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Swedish embassies, together with Wikimedia and local partners, have organised parallel edit-a-thons in more than 50 countries. The global initiative resulted in around 3 000 new or expanded Wikipedia articles on prominent women in more than 30 different languages. Now, one month on, the number of pageviews for these articles has exceeded 2 million. 
It is now time to pass on the baton to other actors. A toolbox to facilitate organising a WikiGap event is being published under a Creative Commons licence on the campaign website www.swemfa.se/wikigap. The toolbox includes a step-by-step guide for organising WikiGap events, logos, communications materials and tips for those actors wanting to take the project forward. A special WikiGap film has also been produced, aimed at generating increased involvement by people throughout the world who want to help increase gender equality on Wikipedia. The film will premiere on 16 April at the Stockholm Forum on Gender Equality. 
WikiGap is part of Sweden's feminist foreign policy, which is based on the ambition to strengthen women's and girls' rights, representation and resources. Through the writing of new, and expanding on existing, articles on Wikipedia, WikiGap is helping to improve women's representation on the internet. Contact
