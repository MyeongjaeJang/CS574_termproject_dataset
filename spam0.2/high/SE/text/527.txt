Well now, if you're a Member of The Local, we can offer you just that. 
While you will still see our sponsored content and the occasional banner ad, most of the ads – including the recommended articles ('You may like') at the bottom of each article – will disappear from The Local when you are logged in. 
We hope that this will enhance your experience of our site.
