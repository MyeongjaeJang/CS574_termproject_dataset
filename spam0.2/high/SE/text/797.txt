Innovation 16 Apr 2018 | London AR for Zara La Vie en Rose at Merci Share Augmented reality is on of those things that is probably nice to have, rather than need to have. Nevertheless, it’s something that many retailers are looking at currently as a means of enhancing the in-store experience and the latest to trial this on a meaningful scale is fashion titan Zara . 
Launched last Thursday in 120 stores across the world, the Zara version of AR involves downloading an app and then pointing it at words and messages in the shop window and on podiums and pillars in the store. Mind visited the New Bond Street store in London to see the process at work and when a smartphone with the app is pointed at the relevant message/trigger a pair of models appear wearing the new season’s collection. They pose, they twirl, they even talk, briefly, and for those who like the garments they see, a single button allows a purchase to be made. The AR will be in-store for just two weeks and is a trial. 
Zara has been trialling a number of different tech-based in-store novelties. In January, it launched a five-month pop-up in London’s Westfield Stratford mall which showcases new collections, but which is in fact an online store only, as well as functioning as a returns point. Zara seems to be leading the mid-market tech fashion pack.
