Bitcoin, Ethereum Prices Remain Steady Despite ‘Crypto Ban’ From India’s Central Bank 
By Comment The crypto markets are holding their own this week, with Bitcoin (BTC) not venturing too far away from $7,000, even amid news that India’s central bank would stop dealing with crypto-related businesses. 
The relatively steady prices could be attributed to a big adoption win in Asia yesterday, when Omise and OmiseGO signed a Memorandum of Understanding for fintech and Blockchain innovation with a South Korean banking affiliate. 
BTC is currently trading for around $6,880, up a little more than 3 percent over a 24 hour period to press time. Ethereum (ETH) is also nearing $400, currently trading at around $381 and up a little more than 3 percent over a 24 hour period to press time. Of the top ten coins listed on CoinMarketCap, only EOS is in the red, down less than 1 percent over a 24 hour period and trading for around $5.92 to press time. 
Monero, which recently updated its protocol to protect the cryptocurrency against ASIC miners, specifically Bitmain’s recently announced Antimer X3, is up a little more than 1 percent over a 24 hour period, in 11th place on CoinMarketCap, trading around $170 by press time. 
Total market cap is around $258 bln according to data from CoinMarketCap, up from April 1’s intraweek low of around $243 bln.
