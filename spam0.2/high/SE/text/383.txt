He previously worked at NCC for nearly 20 years, most recently as the Head of NCC’s construction operations in Sweden. “I’m delighted that Tomas Carlsson will be joining us at NCC before July. This will give him a better chance to influence our operations in 2018 without losing momentum during the summer. I also want to take this opportunity to thank our acting CEO Håkan Broman for his outstanding work during his time as acting CEO. Håkan has made sure that NCC didn’t stagnate during this period without a permanent CEO,” says NCC’s Chairman of the Board Tomas Billing. On the same day that Tomas Carlsson takes over, Håkan Broman will return to his role as NCC’s General Counsel. Ann-Marie Hedbeck, who has served as acting General Counsel for the past five months, will also return to her role as General Counsel of the Infrastructure business area.
