Launches 20 Apr 2018 | New York City Rebag Arrives on Madison Share Rebag , the online luxury handbag reseller, has opened a second physical store on Manhattan. 
For those who have fallen in love with their handbags and then fallen out of love with them this is a good news. 
The first opened less than six months ago as a pop-up in SoHo. That has now become permanent and is the retailer’s flagship. To this can be added the latest arrival, a store on ritzy Madison Avenue, home of the US media and advertising industries in the city. 
With this kind of background, rents for a store in the area will inevitably be high and this is reflected in the selection of stock in the store. It is home to more than 350 used bags and star of the show is an apparently rare ‘Birkin’ handbag from Hermès priced at a cool $70,000. 
Internally this is an uncompromisingly simple store with wooden fixtures designed by Waca Waca Studio and a floor-to-ceiling glazed frontage. 
There is much to be said for simple ideas and this is a straightforward one that is perfectly in tune with its wealthy location.
