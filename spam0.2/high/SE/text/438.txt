FundedByMe, the fastest growing equity crowdfunding platform in Scandinavia, with a network of 110,000 investors, is expanding into Poland. The launch of FundedByMe in Poland will take place on 17 April at Google Campus in Warsaw. The new office in Poland is the fifth international market location beyond Sweden where the platform is headquartered. 
FundedByMe Poland will be headed by Maciej Gajewski. "The aim of our platform is to connect individual investors and entrepreneurs. In Poland, we are looking for the most innovative startups that are targeting international markets and seeking to raise €100,000 to €900,000 in Sweden and other countries. We are going to help Polish companies reach the Nordic market, as well as build the community of individual investors in Poland and connect them with the Scandinavian ones." says CEO FundedByMe Poland Maciej Gajewski. 
As he explains, the platform sees great potential in Poland due to its fast-growing startup ecosystem and the country's promising climate for a new breed of multinational companies. 
The launch event in Warsaw will feature an expert panel discussion with high profile decision-makers at FundedByMe, such as Lovisa Strömsholm who is responsible for Investor Relations and International Growth at the company. Based in Stockholm, she has so far been responsible for coordinating and launching the crowdfunding concept of FundedByMe to new markets in Europe and Asia. Moreover, Ronald Domelid, Swedish entrepreneur and the Co- founder of Stonfactory.se, the largest online retailer in its category, will be among the panelists, as well as Alicja Domelid, founder of Ecoliving and Naturalbox, which raised over €200.000 through FundedByMe. 
The branch in Poland has been set up in cooperation with local partners through a new joint venture.
