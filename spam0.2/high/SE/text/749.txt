Besides being a high-quality miller, Fazer Mills aims to be recognised worldwide as a supplier and developer of oats and special ingredients. Naturalness and well-being as trends are continually growing. Plant-based, sustainable, environmentally friendly and healthy products and ingredients are highly valued among consumers. New technology provides interesting new business opportunities: oat oil, for example, is used as an ingredient in the cosmetics industry. 
Oats have been used in skin care for ages 
Now Fazer Mills has utilised our high-quality Finnish oats, applying traditional bakery heritage and innovative technology in a patented extraction process. This process enables a solvent-free and eco-friendly CO2 extraction to deliver the purest and most neutral end results rich in nutrients. 
Fazer Aurora Oat Oil Pure brings the benefits of oats to cosmetics 
Fazer Aurora Oat Oil Pure is a natural way to add the benefits of oats to cosmetic and personal care products. This versatile ingredient naturally moisturises and soothes the skin and strengthens the hair, and it can also help to reduce wrinkles and signs of ageing. Fazer Aurora Oat Oil Pure is easily assimilated in the manufacture of cleansers, moisturisers and hair treatments to add protective hydration and the benefit of vitamin E for the skin and hair.
