Tips 
• Ask your fish monger to skin and cube the salmon for you. 
• If preferred, the sauce and salmon can be cooked separately with the fillet cut into individual portions: melt 1-2 tablespoons of butter in a pan, add the salmon skin-side down, season with salt, pepper and lemon juice, fry for 2-3 minutes, then turn the salmon over and fry for a further 1-2 minutes until cooked through. Remove from the pan and keep warm. 
• To fry gem lettuce, simply quarter them lengthways and fry in a tablespoon or so of olive oil for about 5 minutes, turning regularly to brown evenly.
