THE JOY’S FACTORY 
Happy day friends of misslopez.se and FEELGOODWOMANHOOD , I am the reporter for Florida of this movement of empowerment and improvement for all people around the world. 

As I have said before, I am Venezuelan, of Spanish roots, living in Florida, I am a coach, facilitator and lecturer in Positive Psychology, a transformational and holistic coach. 

I tell you that soon in the Belgorod WomanHood, we will be developing face-to-face and online experiential workshops, where our main objective is to make you live and experience and bring to your lives techniques that allow you to reach your goals, live a life with less stress, contacting more with your dreams, with your positive beliefs, and with your inner self. 

Based on laugh therapy, meditation, mindfulness, yoga, healing, unblocking of limiting beliefs, transformational coaching techniques, and psychoneuro-linguistics, we will bring to all of you the Happiness Workshop, which is a workshop that I have developed since 2013, in different parts of the world, and in which more than 300 people have participated. 

It is a magical and unique and very valuable experience to live, I am proud to be an Internationally Certified facilitator to develop this workshop, which has brought so much satisfaction to my professional life. 
I leave some photos, please tell me what you think, leave your comments about where you would like to participate in the workshop, I wish you a lot of joy, health and moments of joy in each of your lives, a hug.
