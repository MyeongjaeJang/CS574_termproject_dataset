You’re looking at a 1.1GB download, so perhaps try grabbing it via Wi-Fi. Once you’ve installed it, you’ll be on version N950U1UEU3CRC1, based on Android 8.0 and Samsung Experience 9.0. As usual, this may be a staggered rollout, so keep in mind that a few days could pass before you receive the new software. If you’re impatient, there’s always the possibility of manually checking for it through Settings. 
Thanks for the tip, Kishen Padiyar!
