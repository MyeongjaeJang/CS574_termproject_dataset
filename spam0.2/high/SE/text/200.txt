Patience is the opposite of aggression. The aggressive is impulsive, escapes all reflection and may contradict our will, since many times we can recognize that what we did or said, we would not have done, or not in that way. Patience, on the other hand, allows us the opposite: to stop, reflect and discern what we really want to offer. I am sure that the fear that drives aggression does not survive that space of air that we open between an angry thought and another. Open a gap. It puts us in perspective. He orders us.
