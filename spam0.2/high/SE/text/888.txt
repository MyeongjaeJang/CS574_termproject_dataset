Oppo F7 in for review 19. априла 2018. 3 
Exit Oppo R15, enter Oppo F7. The Selfie Expert vibe is strong with the new F7, which boasts one of the highest-resolution front snappers we’ve seen – a 25MP camera with a variety of modes, effects, and stickers. 
The Oppo F7 is all about the selfies, but it’s made to impress, too. While not relying on gradient paint jobs like its R15 sibling, the F7 is still as flashy with those Solar Red, Moonlight Silver, or Diamond Black color options. 
The F7 looks like any other glass phone we’ve seen lately – mesmerizing at first and smudge fest after a while. But looks can be deceiving, which means Oppo did a great job with design and paint. The F7 is made entirely of plastic – both the frame and rear panel. But unless you are tasked to find out more about the material, you may as well believe it’s a glass throughout the whole time. 
The Oppo F7 packs a pretty bezel-less IPS screen with a notch and Gorilla Glass 5 protection. It’s the same size and resolution as on the R15, sans the AMOLED panel that is. And that tiny notch is what houses that 25MP selfie snapper and the earpiece, among other hidden necessities. 25MP selfie • 25MP selfie Sticker selfie • Sticker selfie • Sticker selfie 
Other notable similarities with the Oppo R15 include the new Helio P60 chip, the 3,400 mAh battery (no VOOC though), and a version with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage. 
The main camera on the Oppo F7 is a single 16MP snapper with f/1.8 bright lens. The video capturing maxes out at 1080p, though. Oppo F7 16MP camera samples 
The Oppo F7 runs on Color OS 5 on top of Android 8.1 Oreo. There is „AI“ onboard, of course, and the provided headset has a dedicated button for the phone’s smart assistant.
