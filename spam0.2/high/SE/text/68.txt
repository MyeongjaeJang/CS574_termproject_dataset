Huawei P20 and P20 Pro rumor roundup: what to expect 27. марта 2018. 2 
Are there any P20 secrets left? We don’t think so, this year the leak harvest has been plentiful – each day, a new spec sprouted near the rumor mill. Still, it bears repeating, so here we go. 
The cameras 
By far the most exciting aspect of the two new flagships. The Huawei P20 Pro will have a whopping 40MP sensor used for stunning stills, but also to assist the 8MP 3x optical zoom camera – both of them working together will deliver 5x hybrid zoom. There will be a third camera on the back, a 20MP monochrome shooter. 
The Huawei P20 will feature the same dual-camera setup used in the Mate 10 – that’s a 12MP color sensor with a 20MP BW sensor. Together, they make for a 2x digital lossless zoom. 
Then around the front, both models will have the same 24MP selfie cam. It will feature AI-powered “light fusion” that will brighten up images. 
On the video side, we don’t know if 4K @ 60fps will be supported, but there will be a 960fps slow-motion mode (shot at 720p). 
The screens 
Both models will come with notched screens with an unusual aspect ratio of 18.7:9. On the P20 Pro, it will be a 6.1” OLED panel. On the P20, a smaller 5.8” LCD. In both cases, the resolution is 1,080 x 2,240px. 
The hardware 
The Kirin 970 will handle both general purpose and AI computations. It will be paired with 6GB of RAM and 128GB storage on the Pro model and 4GB/128GB on the regular P20. There may be other memory combos. Both phones will launch with Android Oreo, naturally. 
Their batteries will support 22.5W SuperCharge and will have capacities of 4,000mAh and 3,400mAh in favor of the Pro model. Charging and music will have to share the USB-C port. 
We’ve heard that the Pro will have a water resistant body (IP67), the non-Pro will not. 
The prices 
The Huawei P20 will start things off at a reasonable €650. If you want the 40MP goodness of the P20 Pro, however, be prepared to fork over €900. 
The colors 
Nothing out of the ordinary with safe Black and Blue choices, but the P20 Pro will stir things up with the iridescent “Twilight” color. The regular P20 will have a Pink option instead. Huawei P20 Pro: black, blue, and „Twilight“ Huawei P20 will be available in Black, Blue and Pink (sorry, no Twilight) 
The tagalong 
Would it surprise you to know that there will be a Porsche Design phone based on the Huawei P20 Pro? Perhaps not and we also shouldn’t be surprised if its price crosses over the €1,000 mark.
