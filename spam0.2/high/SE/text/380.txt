A bit of spring feelings in this outfit, right? Not when I look out the window tho.. haha. They said on TV that the weather was supposed to be 12 degrees celsius but haha, nah not really. It’s been like 1-2 degrees only. B t leaving for LA on Monday so I’m happy about that :) I just got back home from a day full of work, workouts and errands. I’m just chilling at home now but soon getting ready for Julian and Rami’s birthday dinner! Wie! I wish you all a wonderful Friday! xx
