LTI 2019 comprises a maximum of 1,340,000 Series B shares. The Share Matching Plan 2019 covers all permanent employees. The participants can save up to 5 percent of the base salary, for purchase of Saab Series B shares. If the purchased shares are retained for three years and employment within the Saab Group continues, the employee will be granted a corresponding number of shares by Saab free of consideration. The program covers a maximum of 900,000 Series B shares. The Performance Share Plan 2019 is directed at a maximum of 175 key employees including the President. The participants can save up to 7.5 percent of the base salary for purchase of Saab Series B shares. If the purchased shares are retained for three years and employment within the Saab Group continues, the employee is entitled to matching of performance shares, free of consideration, provided that the performance targets are met. The program entitles the employee to allotment of 2-7 performance shares for each purchased share, depending on the group belonging. The number of performance shares is linked to three performance targets: organic sales growth, EBIT margin and free cash flow during the financial year 2019. The Performance Share Plan 2019 covers a maximum of 310,000 Series B shares in Saab. Special Projects Incentive 2019 is directed at a maximum of 45 key employees, including the President. Special Projects Incentive 2019 is a complement to the Performance Share Plan 2019. Participation in the program also presupposes participation in the Performance Share Plan 2019 or the Share Matching Plan 2019. The program entitles the employee to allotment of performance shares corresponding to 15-52.5 per cent of the cash base salary for the financial year 2019 depending on group belonging, provided that the employment remains for three years and that performance targets are reached. The allotment of performance shares are based on the achievement of eight equally weighted performance targets during 2019, related to Saab’s special projects within the product areas Gripen, airborne radar systems (AEW&C) and submarines. For the President and other members of the Group Management, allotment of performance shares in the program and the Performance Share Plan 2019 together, may in total amount to a maximum of 75 per cent of the cash base salary for the President and 60 per cent of the cash base salary for the other members of the Group Management. The program covers a maximum of 130,000 Series B shares in Saab. Furthermore, the Annual General Meeting also decided according to the Board’s proposal on Special Projects Incentive 2018 as a complement to Performance Share Plan 2018, which was adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2017. The program has performance period during the financial year 2018 and corresponding terms and conditions as the Special Projects Incentive 2019. It covers a maximum of 130,000 Series B shares in Saab. The Annual General Meeting also decided to authorize the Board of Directors to decide on acquisition of a maximum of 1,470,000 Series B shares to secure delivery of shares to participants in Saab’s incentive program and for subsequent transfers on the stock exchange to cover certain costs associated with LTI 2019 and Special Projects Incentive 2018, mainly social security costs.

Transfers are normally made during the financial year 2021-2022 and in February 2023 according to the conditions for LTI 2019 and Special Projects Incentive 2018. Acquisition and transfer of own shares The Annual General Meeting decided on authorizing the Board to, before the next Annual General Meeting, decide on the acquisition of Series B shares up to a maximum of 10 percent of the total number of shares in the Company. The purpose of the authorization is to be able to adjust the Company’s capital structure and thereby contribute to an increased shareholder value as well as to enable a continuous use of acquired shares in connection with potential acquisitions of companies and for the Company’s share-related incentive programs. The Board of Directors were further authorized to, before the next Annual General Meeting, decide on transfer of own shares in connection with acquisition of companies. The purpose of the authorization is to provide the Board of Directors with increased scope for action in connection with financing of acquisitions of companies.
