Press Room Statement by Minister for Foreign Affairs Margot Wallstr√∂m regarding the strikes in Syria last night 
The conflict in Syria has killed hundreds of thousands of people. Millions of people have been forced to flee, families have been torn apart and lives have been shattered. The conflict has involved atrocities and violence by the Syrian regime and its allies. The use of chemical weapons is the most horrific weapon of war used in the Syrian conflict. Chemical weapons are prohibited and their use is a serious threat to international peace and security. Sweden understands the anger that has been provoked by the horrendous attacks committed in Syria. 
We regret that the United Nations Security Council, not least because of the Russian veto, has not been able to agree on how the use of chemical weapons in Syria should be stopped by political means and in accordance with the UN Charter. The United States, the United Kingdom and France took military action in Syria last night aimed at deterring the use of chemical weapons. 
Efforts to achieve a political solution and ensure compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention continue. It is now important that the conflict does not escalate, that the UN-led process continues and that the Security Council takes it responsibility under international law. This is the only way we can achieve lasting peace in Syria.
