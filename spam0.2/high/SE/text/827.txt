Although Asprey may be synonymous with all things British – it was founded in the UK in 1781 and has held British Royal Warrants since the 1800s – the brand’s spring/summer 2018 collection celebrates its relationship with a different establishment. Back in 1998, Asprey decided to take its traditional British aesthetic stateside and, this year, the brand celebrates its 20-year residence at the famous Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. Inspired by this partnership, the spring/summer 2018 range is the epitome of Beverly Hills chic. While Asprey’s classic silhouettes remain, the colour palette and designs are a perfect reflection of this Hollywood landmark. From the oversized banana-leaf motifs, which feature throughout the property, to the famous cabana-stripe print and the instantly recognisable shade of pink that covers the hotel’s walls, the very essence of the Beverly Hills Hotel runs throughout Asprey’s collection.
