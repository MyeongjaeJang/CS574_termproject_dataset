RayStation selected for Proton and Carbon Ion Therapy centers in Heidelberg and Marburg, Germany Tue, Apr 10, 2018 16:00 CET 
RayStation* has been chosen as the treatment planning system for Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Center (HIT) and Marburg Ion Beam Therapy Center (MIT) – The new order means that all carbon ion therapy centers in Europe have selected RayStation. 
Heidelberger Ionenstrahl-Therapiezentrum (HIT) and Marburger Ionenstrahl-Therapiezentrum (MIT) in Germany is both operational with protons and carbon ions and operates similar accelerator systems provided by Siemens AG. HIT has been in operation since 2009 and MIT has been in operation since 2015. 
RayStation was selected jointly by clinicians and researchers at HIT, MIT, Heidelberg University Hospital and the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), and the system will be used across the four centers. The decision was motivated by RayStation’s outstanding functionality and comprehensive support for the ion treatment technique as well as its capacity to plan for photon linacs and the TomoTherapy delivery system on the same software platform. The full RayStation installation compromises modules for proton, carbon ion and helium ion pencil beam scanning with robust biological optimization using the LEM and MKM models for radiobiological effect. 
This order is a prerequisite for also providing Helium pencil beam scanning support in RayStation to HIT. Such an agreement is under discussion with HIT and is expected to be finalized during 2018. 
Jürgen Debus, Prof. Dr.med. Dr.rer.nat. at the Heidelberg University Hospital says: “RayStation will give us ultimate flexibility to optimize the treatment plans for our patients and seamlessly integrate proton, ion and photon plans." 
Johan Löf, CEO of RaySearch, says: “A major strength of RayStation is the ability to consolidate treatment planning for diverse treatment techniques and machines. RaySearch is committed to supporting the latest clinical approaches, and we are pleased to meet the wide-ranging needs of HIT and MIT, which are truly at the forefront of cancer treatment.” 
About HIT and MIT Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Center (HIT) and Marburg Ion Beam Therapy Center (MIT) are jointly run advanced cancer treatment facilities located in Southwest Germany. HIT at Heidelberg University Hospital was the first ion-beam therapy center in Europe to be integrated into a hospital facility and has treated more than 4,000 patients since it opened in 2009. MIT started operations in 2015, becoming Germany's second and the world's third heavy-ion therapy facility. The center’s activities are supported by University Hospital Heidelberg and the University Hospital of Giessen and Marburg.
