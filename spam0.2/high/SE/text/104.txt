Airbnb has around 20,000 Swedish rentals listed, and the home-sharing firm has now compiled the Swedish towns with the highest percentage of five-star reviews left by users during 2017. In 2016 Kiruna placed top, followed by Umeå and Karlstad. Here's the new top ten: 
10. Ystad (82 percent five-star reviews) 
Put on the international map by Wallander, this town has a relatively mild climate by Swedish standards due to its location in the south of the country.
