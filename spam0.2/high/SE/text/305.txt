AstraZeneca and MedImmune has announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted the Biologics License Application (BLA) for moxetumomab pasudotox, an investigational anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin and a potential new medicine for the treatment of adult patients with hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) who have received at least two prior lines of therapy. 
The FDA has granted the moxetumomab pasudotox BLA Priority Review status with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act date set for the third quarter of 2018. 
The Phase III (‘1053’) moxetumomab pasudotox clinical trial met its primary endpoint of durable complete response in adult patients with relapsed or refractory HCL, for which there is currently no established standard of care and few treatments available. Results from the 1053 Phase III trial will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting. 
Priority Review is granted by the FDA to applications for medicines that, if approved, would offer a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious conditions.
