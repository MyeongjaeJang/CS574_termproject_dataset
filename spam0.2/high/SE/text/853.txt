AT THE FWRD EVENT FIRST NIGHT IN LA WEARING A FWRD TOP 
Hi guys! SO NO, I didn’t quit blogging as some of you have asked – I’ve been away at Coachella with no working wifi and days filled with parties/events and festival during the nights! It’s seriosuly been so much fun but damn it’s been hectic as fuuuuck. And on that: I got super, super sick .. I’ve been so bad ever since I landed in LA. That sucked! But on the good side – now I have tons of photos that I haven’t posted :) Both from LA and Coachella! Which I hope you’ll like! ND Australia vlog up in 2 hours. WOOP WOOP! Anyway, just landed in Sweden and have slept for 3 hours after a long flight. I’m suck in bed still feeling bad so I’ll just stay here for the rest of the night, editing all the pictures from this week / weekend. So I’m very sorry I didn’t update anything during this trip but yeah, no working wifi ( it took seriously 3 hours to even upload a insta picture.. ), no time to even edit pictures + being sick as fuck isn’t the best combo. Feels good to be back home now with routines again both when it comes to work, blogging/vlogging/instagram, friends/fanily and workouts!!
