SAG launches mini Plug Metal Tag Taichung, Taiwan 
Hannover Messe has long been the largest trade fair for industrial technology. In this edition, Cemat is also being hosted at the same time to bring automation, digitisation, intralogistics and the supply chain into one mega show. 
SAG, a professional developer and manufacturer of high-quality RFID transponders, will be exhibiting at the Hannover Messe that will be held from the 23-27 April 2018 in Hannover, Germany. At the event, SAG sets the theme to unveil two new products – Cable Tie Tag and 6mm Plug Metal Tag to ignite creativity. 
Cable Tie Tag helps fasten a loose object while providing an ID number to assist asset management, item tracking, and material workflow control. It can be applied on a metallic surface and on items with irregular shapes – a viable product solution to be verified in many ways. 
The 6mm Plug Metal Tag plays big in its small size; being put inside the metal, this tiny tag is all but invisible, but becomes aa reality with a demo from SAG to be read by your NFC- enabled phone. This tag helps save up all the connection works and costs less to get the job done. Last but not least, it is the smallest tag in this category featuring such an advantage with superior environment resistance. 
"SAG has talent to realise your RFID applications." Kenny Sin, Sales Director of SAG, inviting professional visitors to check their live demo during the show period from today. Email:
