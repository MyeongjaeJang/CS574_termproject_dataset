MAJORELLE BRUNCH IN LOS ANGELES WEARING A DRESS FROM MAJORELLE – GET IT HERE ( AFFILIATELÄNK) 
Hello from sunny Sweden! Damn, we’ve had two really sunny and warm days now and you can see how people are filling up the parks and streets. Stockholm is finally feeling alive! I just got back home after a day of cleaning our backyard (shared with all the other people living in this building) together with everyone living here, workout at the gym, barbeque with Simon, hanging out in the sun and eating ice-cream with Simon, André and Toby. A perfect saturday! The sun has been shining all day and I’m so happy :) Now I’m just doing a quick facial treatment at home before getting ready for tonight. Just having dinner with André, Toby and Felix and then we’ll see what I want to do.. some people are going out but I’m just too tired I think. And since I won’t drink anything I’ll just keep getting more tired haha. But that’s alright! What are your plans for tonight?
