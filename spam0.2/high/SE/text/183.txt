STROLLING AROUND THE CITY 
So we made it to Dublin! We got here yesterday and has since then visited the Guinness Storehouse, strolling in the city, eaten a lot of food, done a workout and chilled at the hotel :) Last night we went to a restaurant called Opium which was pretty good before crashing into bed. Unfortunately it’s been raining non-stop since we got here so that’s a bit of a bummer but it’s just so cozy to be here with Andrés family ♥ Now we are back at the hotel having a little nap before tonight. It’s an historical day today in Dublin since it’s their first friday in 91 years that they actually have the pubs and so on open. During this easter friday they usually are closed. Funny facts! Well, time for me to take a power nap! 
PS. The Aussie-vlog is delayed! I had to go back to Kentsdottirs office and leave all the videos/files one more time ( the ones that got deleted ) and they are now working on it :) BUT! My workout vlog is coming first! STAY TUNED. )
