RaySearch and IBA to demonstrate first online adaptive proton workflow at ESTRO Mon, Apr 16, 2018 10:00 CET 
RaySearch, the global leader in software for cancer treatment, and IBA, the world’s leading provider of proton therapy solutions for the treatment of cancer, will make a unique joint presentation at the ESTRO 37 Annual Meeting. The companies will demonstrate their innovative approach to optimizing the patient treatment workflow through the first online adaptive proton therapy workflow. 
The comprehensive demonstration will feature the oncology information system RayCare* and the treatment planning system RayStation from RaySearch, in combination with IBA’s adaPT Treatment Suite, composed of the adaPT Insight imaging platform and adaPT Deliver for treatment delivery. 
In an online adaptive workflow, daily cone beam images are taken and matched to the planning CT for a particular patient. Based on the daily images, an updated treatment plan can be automatically suggested to the care team at the time of a treatment session. A plan adaptation that takes the patient’s current situation into account can thus be made before treatment delivery starts. This workflow benefits patients by allowing for more accurate treatments and faster plan adaptation. 
Frederic Genin, Head of Product Management at IBA, says: “The combination of IBA’s most advanced cone beam imaging solutions and RaySearch’s treatment planning and oncology information systems will enable our future clinical partners to make online adaptive proton therapy a reality. We are very excited to see how these advanced capabilities will benefit patients around the world.” 
Björn Hårdemark, Deputy CEO of RaySearch, says: “The treatment planning technologies necessary for adaptive re-planning have long been available in RayStation, and the introduction of RayCare added the workflow components for offline adaptive treatments. Online adaptive treatment demands a tight integration of the delivery systems, and the strategic alliance between IBA and RaySearch makes this possible. This successful integration clearly shows the strength of a collaborative approach.” 
The live demonstration of the first online adaptive proton therapy workflow will take place at the IBA booth, #1400, during the ESTRO Annual Meeting in Barcelona, Spain, 20–24 April 2018.
