I hired a tuk-tuk yesterday afternoon and the driver, Sunja, drove me up to the Goan hillside where we saw and shot several beautiful valleys with small rice paddies, grazing buffaloes, bats and all kinds of fruit trees – including a few with cashews (which I learned from Sunja are not at all a nut). 
To compliment what I’ve already filmed at the retreat, I’m visiting a local fish market here in Agonda later today. Share this entry
