Sponsorship and Community engagement 
SWHAP (Swedish Workplace HIV/AIDS Programme) is a joint initiative by the International Council of Swedish Industry and ten Swedish companies who have employees in Sub-Saharan Africa. In these areas HIV/AIDS is still a major problem for any company which needs a healthy group of employees. The organisation SWHAP helps companies initiate workplace programmes, with more than 370 of these programmes currently in operation. 
Scania supports SWHAPâ€™s overall work, but the company also carries out its own testing and counselling for local drivers in eight different countries. Our aim is to: promote the uptake of HIV testing and counselling among drivers and the general public promote wellness and a healthy lifestyle refer clients for further assessment and help as necessary 
We communicate our engagement in SWHAP through local charity events and our Scania Driver Competitions. We also educate local communities via direct contact with our employees, customers, drivers and local people.
