In late 2017, the Government decided that the Swedish Armed Forces could place a maximum of 15 personnel in the European Union's Military Training Mission in the Central African Republic (EUTM RCA). 
The overall aim of EUTM RCA is to support the country's ongoing reform of the defence and security sector. A substantial part of the training programme is dedicated to training soldiers and includes shooting, body combat, infantry skills such as individual and collective movements, and first aid skills. 
"For Sweden, it is important to support democracy-building in the Central African Republic. We are doing this by contributing to the EU training mission EUTM RCA," says State Secretary Jan Salestrand. 
The mission, which is made up of some 170 personnel from several European countries, was launched on 16 July 2016, following a decision by the Council of the European Union to replace the EU Monitoring and Advisory Mission. 
Marie-Noëlle Koyara is primarily in Sweden to take part in the Stockholm Forum on Gender Equality, hosted by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Swedish Institute, in partnership with the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and Folke Bernadotte Academy.
