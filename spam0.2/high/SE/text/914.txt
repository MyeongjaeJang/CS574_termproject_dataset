Saab Receives Order for Australian OPV Situational Awareness System Press release 20 April 2018 
Saab has received a contract from Luerssen Australia for the Situational Awareness System (SAS) for the Royal Australian Navy’s new Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPV). The contract is expected to run over the 12 year OPV shipbuilding programme, which will see the delivery of 12 new ships. 
In addition to the SAS, which is based on Saab Australia’s 9LV Combat Management System, the OPV will be fitted with Saab’s EOS 500 (electro-optical fire control director). 
“Saab Australia is pleased to receive this order from Luerssen Australia. This is also an important step towards system commonality for the Navy, with 9LV installed, or contracted for delivery, across four classes of ship.” says Andy Keough, Managing Director for Saab Australia. 
“The development work being undertaken by Saab in Australia will also support export opportunities and position us well for future maritime projects.” 
Saab Australia will carry out the majority of the work in its Adelaide facilities, which will create and sustain up to 50 jobs. Local Australian companies will be contracted to fabricate selected components of the SAS including command consoles and computer cabinets, providing a high level of Australian industry participation and sovereign capability. The contract is received within the business area Surveillance.
