Kjell Lindgren from Stockholm police explained that the matter is now with the prosecutor, who must decide how to proceed due to an embassy being regarded as foreign territory. 
"In connection with it someone was arrested suspected of attempted assault. He was questioned, then released as there wasn't cause to keep him detained. So now the ball is in the prosecutor's court, who has to decide what kind of crime classification to use, because the embassy is treated as a foreign power's territory and something was thrown into it. The prosecutor needs to decide on how the crime will be classified and we've not had that decision yet." 
"There's no information of serious injuries, but then it's a question of what you treat as an injury. A number of bangers were thrown in. If I for example had tinnitus as a result of a banger being thrown near me, I'd consider myself to be injured. That's why we were saying that there were no serious injuries as far as we know," he added. 
Police would not comment on whether the person arrested was linked to the NMR, but the neo-Nazi group took credit for it on their website, where they wrote that after a speech on how "the only people who gain something from the attack (on Syria) is the global Zionist elite" the group then "let the war criminals taste their own medicine â€“ by bombing the USA!".
