Stockholm, April 1, 2018 - By 2024, the first colonization of Mars is expected to focus on establishing an infrastructure for electric power, mining and life support. The global payment provider, Klarna, will through its newly established space program "Space.K." play a key role in the development of civilisation on Mars. The overall aim is to become the first universal payment solution spanning all across the Milky Way. 
“Throughout human history, it is well-known that thriving civilizations have been built on a foundation of trade and commerce. Payments is central to that development. We therefore want to contribute with what we do best, delivering the smooothest payments solution and user experience in the galaxy. Our top priority right now is to offer an end to end solution to the new inhabitants. This is truly the final frontier”, says Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO and co-founder, Klarna. 
The “Space.K.” program will support payments and shopping by building a fleet of small unmanned spacecrafts that can be used to ship products to Mars. The first product to be launched this way is a vitamin enriched smoothie developed specifically for astronauts.
