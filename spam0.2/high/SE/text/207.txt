- Getting sustainable financial markets on the EU agenda is a breakthrough. There is a great deal more to be done in this area, said Mr Bolund, commenting on the new Action Plan at the conference.Mr Bolund stressed that the Swedish Government is working successfully to ensure that environmental and climate impacts are integrated into financial risk assessments. Rapid progress has been made and there is huge interest from all stakeholders, but Mr Bolund also pointed out that Sweden's voice has been rather isolated and urged international support on the issue. 
- National efforts are important, but since the financial sector is highly international, sustainability issues also need to be addressed at international level if we want to achieve positive long-term results with geographical breadth, Mr Bolund said. 
He also mentioned the bilateral cooperation on green financing recently agreed between France and Sweden. 
The speakers at the conference included French President Emmanuel Macron, President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, and a number of European Commissioners, Members of the European Parliament and representatives of the financial sector. 
The conference was hosted by the European Commission.
