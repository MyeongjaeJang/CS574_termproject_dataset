Press Room Inquiry paves way for automated vehicles The Government’s Inquiry Chair Jonas Bjelfvenstam presented on March 7 2018, his final report ‘The path to automated driving – market introduction’ (SOU 2018:16) to the Minister for Infrastructure Tomas Eneroth. The Inquiry proposes regulatory changes necessary to begin using and developing automated vehicles on roads over the next few years. 
The Inquiry also proposes measures that need to be taken in the longer term. The Inquiry's proposals include: 
• increased facilitation of tests of automated driving;• new system of responsibility, including owner responsibility;• new definitions for automated vehicles, vehicles being driven automatically• Introduction of class II automated road machines for speeds not exceeding 20 km/h or walking pace without a test permit;• a requirement for data storage for automated vehicles that are designed to be operated in both automatic and manual mode. 
– The safe development of automated transport is a prerequisite for gaining acceptance for this technology in society. Most interesting is the development of automation in commercial transport, as well as in shared and public transport. In the long term, the technology may provide new opportunities for mobility and transport in sparsely populated areas and for people who currently have limited access to their own transport, says Inquiry Chair Jonas Bjelfvenstam. 
The regulatory changes are proposed to enter into force on 1 July 2019. Shortcuts
