3 tbsp freshly chopped dill, parsley or chives 
Method 
1. Gently melt the butter in a saucepan, then remove from heat and carefully whisk in the flour to make a thick paste. 
2. Add the milk a bit at a time to the paste, whisking after each addition, then add the cream. 
3. Return the pan to the heat, stirring until the sauce thickens and comes to the boil. 
4. Simmer gently for 10 minutes, stirring regularly to prevent the bottom burning. 
5. Add the salt, pepper and ground nutmeg (optional). Taste and adjust the seasoning. 
6. Cut the potatoes into quarters or thick slices and add them to the sauce. Stir them carefully to ensure that they are all warmed through. 
7. Add the chopped herbs just before serving and stir again.
