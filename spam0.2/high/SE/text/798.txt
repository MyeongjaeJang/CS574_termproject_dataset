Ted Baker’s Old Street Digital Impostor Share Luxury department store Harrods has opened its first pop-up vintage store, Fashion Retold, with all proceeds being donated to the children’s charity NSPCC . 
Harrods has been a long-term supporter of this charity. 
Open for one-month only, the store is selling women’s, men’s and children’s luxury items which have been donated by Harrods’ customers, employees and brands including Mulberry, Loewe, JW Anderson, Céline, Victoria Beckham and Anya Hindmarch. Prices range from £100 to £200 for both vintage and current-season pieces. 
Fashion Retold is run by NSPCC and all staff have been trained by Harrods on how to sell luxury items. 
The store’s design has been created with Instagram top of mind. For the charity to make money and garner attention, the store has to be ‘instagrammable’ to deliver widespread social media coverage. The space is entirely designed in millennial pink, which also happens to NSPCC’s corporate colour. The design brief is simple luxury where there is ample space for customers to walk about and the pieces are sparingly stocked. 
The vintage pop-up sits well in the luxury shopping haven, however with all proceeds going to charity, this is the definition of retail therapy.
