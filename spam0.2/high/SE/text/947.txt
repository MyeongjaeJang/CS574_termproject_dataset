Öresund Bridge reopens after temporary closure due to smoke TT/The Local 21 April 2018 12:31 CEST+02:00 The Öresund Bridge connecting Denmark and Sweden was temporarily closed on Saturday morning due to smoke in the tunnel section of the crossing. 
The bridge was briefly closed in both directions on Saturday but traffic is now flowing normally, a press spokesperson said. 
The smoke is reported to have come from a car in the tunnel. 
“There is normal traffic again in both directions. The smoke came from a car, it was later extinguished and the car has been removed,” Sanna Holmqvist, press spokesperson with operating company Öresundsbron, told TT. 
The road and rail connection, which links Malmö and Copenhagen across the Öresund strait, consists of a near-eight kilometre long bridge from the Swedish coast to artificial island Peberholm in the middle of the strait, and a four-kilometre tunnel from Peberholm to the Danish island of Amager.
