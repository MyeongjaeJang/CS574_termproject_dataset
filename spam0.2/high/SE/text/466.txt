Public sector workers in Germany including ground crew and airport firefighters are striking on Tuesday between 5am and 5pm local time, hitting airports like Frankfurt – Germany's largest – and Munich. 
It is to those two airports that SAS has been forced to stop its flights, and the websites of Stockholm Arlanda , Gothenburg Landvetter , Copenhagen Kastrup and Oslo Gardermoen airports for example show SAS Tuesday departures to the German cities as cancelled. A total of 26 of the airlines flights are impacted. 
German giant Lufthansa meanwhile will cancel more than 800 of 1,600 scheduled flights – including 58 long-haul trips – over the strikes.
