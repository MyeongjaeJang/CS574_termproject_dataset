Sponsorship and Community engagement 
Wherever we operate in the world, our engagement in the community is a great contribution but also a task that carries great responsibility. We need to focus our efforts on where we have the right skills and capabilities so that we can make a long-term commitment. 
We have developed a global sponsoring and community engagement framework to help our business with what, how and where we provide sponsoring and support. Why do we engage? 
The people we meet around us are engaged, passionate and skilled. Scaniaâ€™s Sponsorship and Community Engagement initiative is based on the firm belief that we can contribute to building a better community for all of us. Who do we engage with? 
We aim to be a partner in projects that support our vision and that share our values. We want to create partnerships that can be beneficial in more aspects than just pure business goals. In order to be perceived as a thought leader and a true global citizen, we need partners that are from the same mould as us. That is why we look for long-term partners whose brave ideas will set the standards of tomorrow. 
We have selected four focus areas of engagement: Transport solutions A sustainable society The great local player
