My first milagerun is a part of the class struggle April 5, 2018 by admin Leave a Comment 
Every thursday evening SAS have a sale on some destinations. To day its to Boston and Chicago and I have always wanted to visit Hay Market in Chicago so when I found a weekend trip for just 3500 I could nor resist to book it. 
So now I will visit Hay Market on the evening of the 4 of may, the day the infamous massacre happend. What a great way to struggle for the champagne socialism. Share this:
