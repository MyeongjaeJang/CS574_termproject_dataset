Gah, so much happening right now! But fun stuff so that’s good!! Just got back from a full day of work, shooting loads of styles, meetings, lunch with Fanny at Rev, workout with Simon and then launch party at TRESOR by Fightbox. Yey! I just made some dinner and watching Family Guy. Heading to bed in an hour, I’m soooo tired. What have you been up to today?
