Restaurant ÄT in Nyköping Forever - So great, So good Restaurant ÄT, Nyköping Forever. Just saying. Incredible service, incredible staff, incredible beer and incredible food. This time I tried Mead (Mjöd) for the first time in my life, and it was very different and surprisingly. I liked it, but more as a great wine than as a beer. But speaking about beer, I also tried one of the best, I've ever have tasted, Mr. Orange by To ØL . A very, very good Sour Beer . It's like a Loranga but as a beer! Awesome. And the food today was awesome, a Pizza and a Sallad. Posted
