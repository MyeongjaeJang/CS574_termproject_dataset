Xiaomi confirms Mi 6X will be the star of April 25 event, 20MP cameras on board 16. априла 2018. 4 
Xiaomi had already sent out invites to an April 25 event but it wasn’t crystal clear what it will unveil nor where it will hold the event. 
Well, the next teaser clears both of those – Xiaomi will unveil the Mi 6X (and Mi A2) in the province of Wuhan’s capital city of Hubei. 
The place is dear to Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun who obtained his Computer Science degree in Wuhan back in 1991. 
The official teaser confirms the Xiaomi Mi 6X’s dual 20MP cameras while the recent rumors add that it will have a 5.99-inch 2160x1080px tall-aspect display, a Snapdragon 626 chipset and 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage. There will be a relatively modest 2,910mAh battery. 
The Xiaomi Mi A2 will be a mirror image, except that it will be an Android One device and will run stock Android, rather than MIUI.
