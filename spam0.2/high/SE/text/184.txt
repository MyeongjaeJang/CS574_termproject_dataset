Manchester United vs Swansea – Best odds 31/3 – 2018 March 28, 2018 / Viktor Mattsson / Premier League Blog / No Comments 
Perhaps a bit surprisingly Swansea have seen an upswing lately and have exceeded to 14th position in the table. United will not have any possibility to catch up with their local neighbors in the title fight but with Liverpool, Spurs, and Chelsea chasing from behind, this game is still crucial to secure the champions league spot. Should be a walk in the park for the red devils. Prediction: Manchester United win 
KICK OFF: 15.00 GMT 31/3 – 2018
