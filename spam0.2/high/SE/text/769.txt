Rubble Master in London Published Today at 12:03 Reducing noise, dust and emissions is the main goal of the London Borough of Camden and its clean air action plan, especially with regards to construction and demolition work. The mobile impact crusher, RM 70GO! 2.0, proved to be an ideal solution in order to comply with the legal and space requirements of the plan and the operation in cramped sites recently at Camden Market, one of the largest and most well-known markets in the centre of London. The contractor for the Camden scheme was looking for a crusher that would also be able to handle the special conditions at the central London site. Here, a building next to a school located in Camden Market was to be demolished where there was little space to manoeuvre. Site access was also restricted with access being via a 2.5m - approximately - entrance. Through a recommendation from an acquaintance, the contractor found out that RM crushers can produce the required final aggregate in a single pass that can be used again immediately on the job site. This resulted in the company renting a 70GO! 2.0 from the British Rubble Master dealership Red Knight 6 Ltd, with the RM 70GO! 2.0 taking only five days to crush the 4000t of material.
