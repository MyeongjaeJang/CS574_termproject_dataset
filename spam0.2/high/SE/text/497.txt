Press Room Nerve gas attack in Salisbury and Brexit in focus when Stefan Löfven received Theresa May On Monday 9 April, UK Prime Minister Theresa May visited Stockholm for a meeting with Prime Minister Stefan Löfven. 
One important subject of the talks was the aftermath of the nerve gas attack in Salisbury against the Russian former agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter. At the EU summit on 22 March it was decided there would be a coordinated reaction. The EU has recalled its Ambassador from Moscow and 14 EU Member States, including Sweden, have decided to expel Russian diplomats. During the meeting, Ms May also informed Mr Löfven about the UK’s view of its withdrawal from the EU and the upcoming future-oriented talks between the EU and the UK. Sweden and the other EU countries will be represented by the European Commission in these negotiations. Mr Löfven and Ms May also discussed bilateral cooperation between Sweden and the UK.
