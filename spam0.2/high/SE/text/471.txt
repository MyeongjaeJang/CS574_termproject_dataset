The UMA Workspace-branded facility will be built into a leased 1,950 square meter space with 33 small offices, 60 hot desks and 5 shared conference rooms. It will be located in the very center of the city next to Strøget, Copenhagen’s main shopping street, and the City Hall. The space will be named UMA Vestergade. Technopolis has reserved EUR 30M to build up a network of 20 UMA coworking spaces in the biggest cities of the Nordic and Baltic Sea region by the end of 2020. These will be stand-alone facilities located outside the Technopolis’ campus network. UMA Vestergade will be Technopolis’ third stand-alone coworking space. The first stand-alone UMA was opened in Helsinki in 2016 and the second will open in the Stockholm city center in April 2018.”The shared workspace book is picking up speed and so is Technopolis. Our UMA concept is an essential part of Technopolis’ strategy. The new UMA in Copenhagen is our first step in Denmark, but it’s still just the beginning. We intend to expand our footprint and deploy our concept aggressively, rapidly and professionally. We are pushing hard to launch several more UMAs this year,” says Keith Silverang, CEO of Technopolis.
