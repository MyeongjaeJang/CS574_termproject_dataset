The property encompasses approximately 19,000 square meters leasable area, where the majority consists of warehouse spaces and cooling stocks for local distribution. The property has multiple tenants and the current lease rate is approximately 70 percent. The acquisition takes place in company form with an underlying property value of EUR 8M. “Malmö and the Öresund region are expansive and very prioritized markets for us. The range of interesting objects is limited, but in Måseskär 5 we see a hefty terminal building with development possibilities in a submarket we have been active in for a long time. Through the acquisition we create opportunities to further develop our offer of smart city logistics in the Öresund region, which has a huge potential,” says Eva Landén, CEO at Corem. Possession was taken on April 13th. Pangea Property Partners was the seller’s advisor in the transaction.
