Press Room Explanation of vote (2) by Sweden at the UNSC Adoption on Middle East (Syria) Explanation of vote (2) delivered by Ambassador Olof Skoog on behalf of Sweden at the United Nations Security Council Adoption on Middle East (Syria), 10 April 2018, New York. 
Thank you Mr President.We deeply regret that we have ended up here after a long day and I think, by some of us, serious efforts. We abstained on the Russian draft just now because it was not clear on the attribution and accountability track, which we believe is important.We called for the consultations just now because we felt that, provided that there is political will, there was still an opportunity today for us to shoulder our responsibility. We put forward a draft to all members, which we felt was credible, assertive, which was intended to support the OPCW Fact Finding Mission, but also which was very clear in its determination to establish an impartial, independent and professional investigate mechanism. And we had suggested for the Secretary-General to help us to recommend the best way forward there and to give us ten days, or to give him ten days for him to come back and I think that would have been a much better way forward than where we are right now.So I am very disappointed that we have not been able to move forward on this. I thank all those who were ready to engage and I just hope that we do not consider this the end when it comes to ensuring that the facts are established and that there is a true accountability and no more impunity for the horrendous use of chemical weapons in Syria and elsewhere.Thank you very much.
