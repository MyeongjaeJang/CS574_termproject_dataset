Swedes hold strongest views on gender equality in the EU 
Stamkou noted that there is "still a gender gap in IT in Sweden like everywhere else". In order to make a meaningful impact the course goes beyond teaching participants programming itself, also helps to guide them towards their favoured niche then places them in a paid three-month internship with partner companies.

The course is open to anyone with a Swedish personal number (personnummer) and the right to live and work here, provided they have good English skills. Participants in the pilot course were selected after a math and logic test followed by interviews. 
Stamkou thinks that one of the keys to helping more women succeed in IT is making sure they stay motivated despite the difficult environment: 
"We're bringing in a lot of guest lecturers to support the course participants. Other women who have been through this process will motivate participants to continue learning, because there's a lot of fear about programming, especially once you are a woman with no experience in IT. That's one reason why there's a huge gender gap." 
If the company can secure more sponsors to help pay for the largely self-funded scheme the long-term goal is to take it beyond Stockholm. The co-founder thinks more initiatives to help women get into programming could only be a good thing. 
"If you have equality, you have diversity and diversity is needed. Different opinions and perspectives are only helpful. More initiatives would definitely be helpful, and our vision is to expand outside Stockholm then later outside Sweden, into the Nordics and further into Europe and beyond," Stamkou concluded.
