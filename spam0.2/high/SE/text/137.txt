Launches 27 Mar 2018 | London The Isle of Dogs Pop-Up Follow us Kyoto Tradition for Miyake Share Wes Anderson has opened his very own pop-up Ramen Bar to promote his new Japanese-influenced animated film, Isle of Dogs. Wes is no stranger to designing cafes, having created Bar Luce in Foundazione Prada in Milano. Wes created the Ramen Bar in conjunction with Fox Searchlight Pictures and it is an innovative way to promote a film and deliver column inches outside of the traditional film review. 
The Isle of Dogs exhibition is located on The Strand in London and is housed in a temporary creative events space called The Store . The space contains 17 of the original intricate films sets and recreates the filmâ€™s fictional city of Megasaki. It also includes a life-size Ramen bar that is featured in the film where customers can come in, dine and have sake cocktails. The soundtrack to the film is also played to allow customers to be fully immersed in the film. 
The pop-up is open until 5 of April. Event address Cookies are a small bits of code that we store on your computer to remember you when you return, and to track your site behavior.
