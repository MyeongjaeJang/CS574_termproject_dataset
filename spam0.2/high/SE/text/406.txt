relajate en la naturaleza 
English/ 
Hello to all the friends that we liked, the greetings from Florida Florida, I hope that all are very well living their lives at every moment with intensity and gratitude, 
Today I am in a park near the beach and I can not help but be grateful for everything I see, even for being able to see, it fills me with satisfaction to be able to live in such a beautiful planet, I feel a very lucky being, even living , to see, to breathe, to feel, to be human and to be here and now. 
Immersing yourself in the natural world can provide stress relief and deep relaxation. 
Practices such as bathing at the beach can be a form of essential self-care. 
What better way to enjoy life exploring the beauty of nature to our surroundings. 
Happy Sunday
