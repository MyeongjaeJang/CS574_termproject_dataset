RUNYON CANYON WITH THE GANG FIRST PHOTO BY JANNI // I’M WEARING GIA.THE.LABEL SWEATER 
The first morning in LA we all decided to meet up at Runyon Canyon to hike the hill up to the top to watch the sunrise :) It sure was beautiful! That is the best part about jetlag – When you go to the states and go to bed at nine and wake up at four in the night hahahah. It’s not so good when you travel back to Sweden tho and want to stay up until 3-4 in the night and wake up around lunch haha. Pray for me that I’ll be able to stay pretty OK when it comes to my jetlag! The worst thing you can do is to sleep in and also sleep during the day .. that is a big no-no! You got any good advice on getting rid of the jetlag fast? PLEASE HELP A BROTHER OUT!
