One of the largest banks in Sweden chose City Network Discoveries and solutions 
When looking at our support organisation and how our users experience our services we have discovered a number of points to improve. These have been our guiding stars when re-designing your experience with City Cloud Support. 
Knowing exactly what you are getting 
Improving our processes and making sure that the order of priority is even more clear has been one of our most important tasks. Any user who interacts with us needs to know what to expect, when and how. 
Self service 
Self service is crutial and improving our tools is another important challenge. By implementing this new take on support and how itâ€™s delivered to our users we will be able to focus even more on improving our self service tools. 

City Cloud support is now available in 3 different packages.

Pre-sales and basic inquiries via e-mail during our business hours. Heavily focused on self-service.
