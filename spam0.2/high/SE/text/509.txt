onsdag 11 april 2018 | business intelligence Dubai immigration process to be cut to just 10 seconds Senior official says new Smart Gate system has undergone testing and will go live next month, writes Arabian Business AM newsletter this morning. Dubai is soon to launch the "Smart Gate", a quicker alternative to the standard manual passport control counters and e-gates across the emirates airports. Major General Mohammed Ahmed Al Marri, director-general of the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs-Dubai (GDRFA-Dubai) said that the new gate will enable each passenger to pass through immigration "within only 10 seconds". The announcement came as part of the initiatives unveiled by the department at Dubai International Government Achievements Exhibition. "The new system successfully underwent the experimental stage and we are planning to put it into action by the end of this May," Al Marri said. Unlike the e-gate, which requires an e-gate card, the smart gate does not require a dedicated card. It can identify a traveller by either their passport, Emirates ID, e-gate card or QR barcode generated via the GDRFA smartphone app. "It is seven seconds faster than the e-gate when processing a passengers credentials and provide the quickest way through passport control," he said. The e-gates across the immigration checkpoints served more than 6,500 million inbound passengers from January to March 2018 and more than 6,800 outbound passengers during the same period, more than 13,500 million in total, he added.
