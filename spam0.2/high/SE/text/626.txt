Hi again, I have been so busy I have had no time for blogging. I have been in a showing trip at Valle Romano in Costa del Sol. it is actually a new investment concept and I believe itÂ´s really good for the right public. The one in Valle Romano project is perfect for those golf lovers so I soon I am back to Sweden I am going to contact the golf courses and clubs. 
Now I must go and my post will be short but I just wanted to say Hello and wish you a nice weekend!
