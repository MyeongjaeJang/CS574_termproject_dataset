Anna Quindlen : “When you leave college, there are thousands of people out there with the same degree you have; when you get a job, there will be thousands of people doing what you want to do for a living. But you are the only person alive who has sole custody of your life.”   Wednesday, March 21st, 2018 at 23:46
