Comcast Business invests USD 1.7 mln to expand Ethernet network in Harrisburg   10:05 CET | News Comcast Business invested USD 1.7 million to expand its fibre-based network in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. This expansion deployed more than 27 miles of new fibre optic cable in and near downtown Harrisburg, bringing high-performance Ethernet, internet and advanced voice products to 600 additional businesses and organisations and benefiting hundreds more by making the network more accessible. 
The extensions, which are both aerial and underground, connect Jonestown Road to the northeast of downtown Harrisburg with Mechanicsburg and also include downtown buildouts both north of the Harvey Taylor Bridge (including but not limited to North 6th Street, Division Street, North 2nd Street) and south of the Harvey Taylor Bridge (including but not limited to North 3rd Street, North and South Front Streets, Blackberry Street). In addition, Comcast connected its network to the Friendship Industrial Park in Swatara Township. 
The Comcast Business team continues to win customers in Central Pennsylvania and throughout its Keystone Region, recently joining CenturyLink in signing a five-year contract with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to provide data networking products to the Commonwealth’s agencies, commissions, councils, bureaus, authorities and boards. 
Comcast Business also constructed a 100 Gbps network connecting Penn State University’s data center with its Milton S. Hershey Medical Center facility and has also completed proactive fiber extensions in downtown Pittsburgh and Chambersburg while actively working on the completion of another in Jefferson County, PA.
