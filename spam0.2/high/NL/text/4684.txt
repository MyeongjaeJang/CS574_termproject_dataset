CVC, other private equity firms eyeing UK operator Daisy - report   09:42 CET | News 
Private equity firms including CVC Capital Partners are eyeing bids for the UK's Daisy Group in an auction that could value the company at about GBP 1 billion, banking sources told Reuters. UBS and Oakley Advisory, which were hired to sell the company last year, are likely to send out confidential information about Daisy to prospective buyers in April, the report said. 
Interest is expected to come from buy-out houses including CVC and Providence Equity Partners rather than from rival telecoms companies, they said. Daisy’s advisers have already held informal conversations with possible suitors, according to one of the sources. 
The sale process is expected to value the provider at less than the GBP 1.5 billion price-tag reported in December, the sources said, with one estimating the company was worth closer to GBP 1.1-1.2 billion. This would fall short of the expectations of the group’s founder, Matthew Riley, who started the business from his garage 17 years ago, grew it through a string of acquisitions, and remains its chairman. 
A spokesman for Riley said the chairman "wouldn’t sell the business" for that price range but did not give a valuation the founder would accept.
