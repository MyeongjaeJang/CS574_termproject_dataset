It looks like the rise of Kendrick Lamar’s rap career will soon make its way to bookshelves. 
According to Vibe , Bandcamp Senior Editor Marcus J. Moore announced on Thursday that he signed a deal to write a “cultural biography” about the rapper. 
He said, “Some big news I’ve been eager to share: I’ve signed with Touchstone Books to write the cultural biography of Kendrick Lamar. My book, “The Butterfly Effect: How Kendrick Lamar Ignited the Soul of Black America,” will detail his rise to rap superstardom.” 
K. Dot has had an explosive career, after releasing his 2012 album “Good Kid, M.A.A.D City.” He would later follow up with his 2015 album “To Pimp A Butterfly,” and his latest “Damn,” which was released last year. 
Earning a total of 11 Grammy Awards since 2015, there is no doubt Kendrick has way more to add on to his legacy.
