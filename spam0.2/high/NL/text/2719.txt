Share on: google + Umbro’s iconic diamond logo has appeared on the work of some of the coolest brands around, as the likes of Patta and Palace have reinvented classic kits with their own streetwear image. Now, Umbro has been given a hip-hop inspired refix, teaming up with famous hip-hop photographer, Mel D Cole. Unanimous with hip-hop in New York, Cole has photographed some true legends., all starting at 2001 concert where he took photos Erykah Badu and Common. He’s since gone on to shoot the likes of A Tribe Called Quest, Nas and Mos Def and now, this very cool collab with Umbro. Sponsors on these shirts are typical of inner-city life, with Queens Kings United F.C.’s Big Mama’s Chicken Shack sponsor being an example of that. The shirts celebrate New York via football, bringing the ordinary yet iconic spots of NYC to football shirts in a brilliant way. There are four different shirts, all photographed by Mel D Cole himself in this excellent lookbook. These are available to buy, too, from Umbro, themselves.
