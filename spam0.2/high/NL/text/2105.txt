LinkedIn unveils third annual Top Companies list WEBWIRE – Wednesday, March 21, 2018 
We are launching the 2018 LinkedIn Top Companies list . The annual ranking highlights the 50 companies that are most sought-after by professionals, based on proprietary LinkedIn data that examines billions of actions by more than 540 million professionals on LinkedIn. 
The 2018 Top Companies realize they must find new ways to woo professionals and set an example for the way corporate America treats employees. Among the themes emerging: 
Purpose over perks: Foosball tables and all-you-can-eat cafeterias lose their appeal if workers cannot get the job done. Amazon (No. 1) attracts top talent by offering a corporate infrastructure that enables employees to see the impact of their work on a broad audience by not delaying launches with internal processes  even if employees need to find a vending machine for a snack. 
Diversity pipeline: Top Companies are testing bold tactics to build a diverse workforce. Oracle (No. 9) opened a charter high school on its campus to invest in STEM-based education, and Box (No. 44) eliminated four-year degree requirements to focus on hiring candidates for their skill sets over their degrees. 
Rethinking corporate healthcare: Employee health is top of mind for these companies, and they are breaking the corporate mold. Amazon (No. 1) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (No. 18) are part of a partnership with Berkshire Hathaway to develop a new healthcare company that aims to cut costs and improve coverage for employees. Apple (No. 6) is reportedly working on primary care clinics for employees that are expected to be at the forefront of combining technology with care. 
Here is what the highest ranked LinkedIn Top Companies are doing to attract and keep top talent: 
Amazon (No. 1) now offers to prepay 95% of tuition, textbooks and fees for its employees to receive training in professions of the future. 
Alphabets (No. 2) newest offices include sky-high dog parks, indoor fire pits and bouldering walls. 
Facebook (No. 3) extended its bereavement leave policy last year to up to 20 days, a policy developed after Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg suddenly lost her husband. 
Salesforce (No. 4) does continuous audits of its salary data and has spent $6 million trying to ensure equal compensation across gender and race. 
Tesla (No. 5) has a carpool program that allows employees to drive a Tesla to work. 
Apple (No. 6) offers its employees a 25 percent discount on the companys devices. 
Comcast NBCUniversal (No. 7) employees get complimentary access to Universal theme parks, discounts on resorts and early access to NBCUniversal movies and TV shows. 
The Walt Disney Company (No. 8) made an initial investment of $50 million at the beginning of the year in an ongoing education program specifically designed to cover tuition costs for hourly employees. 
Oracle (No. 9) recognizes its developers as inventors and creators of world-changing tech and encourages them to file patents. 
Netflix (No. 10) doesnt have policies on vacation time, paid parental leave, dress code or expenses. We trust our teams to do what they think is best for Netflix, the company says. 
The list includes rankings for the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India and the United Kingdom. Driven by LinkedIns editorial team, the Top Companies list was developed by analyzing billions of actions taken by LinkedIns more than 540 million professionals to come up with a blended score used to rank the winners in each country.
