Al-Waleed, an experienced businessman with extensive ties in the Western world, probably quickly realized that the award stunt would spark controversy, considering that, by then, it was quite clear that Saudi bombs were killing civilians by the dozen. Three years on, the bloodshed and human suffering in Yemen has got much worse, and Saudi Arabia was a major contributor. Read more 3yrs of civilian deaths in Yemen don’t hold US & allies back from selling arms to Saudis – Amnesty 
Between March 2015 and February 2018, almost 6,000 civilians had been killed and 9,500 wounded, according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The Saudi-led coalition conducted over 16,600 air raids, with roughly a third of them targeting non-military sites, according to an Al Jazeera count. Almost 1,500 of them hit residential areas. Amnesty International says at least 36 of them violated international laws and may have constituted war crimes. 
Saudi Arabia also imposed a naval and air blockade of Yemen. It restricts the supply of crucial goods like food, medicine and fuel, humanitarian aid, and access by foreigners, who could independently access and report the situation in the country. There is a strong argument that Riyadh is using what is termed siege warfare against its opponents in Yemen. It’s a time-tested tactic of having enemy troops and civilians cut off supply lines, constantly harassed by shelling and sniper fire, and ultimately starved into death or submission. It is also a war crime. 
Yemen, the poorest nation in the Arab world, now has 8.4 million people on the verge of severe hunger – around 40 percent of its population. One million have been infected by cholera in the biggest outbreak of the waterborne disease in decades – an outbreak that probably would not have happened if Yemen’s water-treatment plants and hospitals had not been destroyed, and if its people had proper access medicine and healthcare. The accomplices 
Of course, Saudi Arabia is not the ‘bad guys’ to Houthi ‘good guys.’ As it often happens in civil wars, all sides in Yemen do horrible and criminal things. But the Yemeni bloodbath serves as a glaring example of Western duplicity in its attitude to wars. Riyadh would probably not have managed all this without help from its Western allies. 
Mohammad bin Salman – who has come out on top in the Saudi palace struggle and is now the crown prince – received a red-carpet welcome in America just a week before the anniversary of his Yemen adventure. He was praised as a great modernizer, the personified hope for a new and better Saudi Arabia, giving its women at least some rights, and no longer finances radical preachers throughout the world. Interviewers didn’t challenge him much on Yemen, content with his blaming of Iran for the dire situation there. 
He left with extra $1 billion worth of US-approved arms contracts, adding to billions upon billions of dollars in American arms that Saudi Arabia purchased previously. The money is “peanuts for you” US President Trump joked. Saudi warplanes dropped US- made bombs on Yemeni homes and are likely to continue doing so. The US does not bother to track where those bombs drop. 
The crown prince’s visit to UK, another major supplier of arms to Saudi Arabia, went along the same lines – but with no charts showing off Tornado jets or Brimstone missiles from Prime Minister Theresa May. There were also hundreds of protesters demanding his arrest in London streets. The UK’s sales of arms to the Saudis jumped by almost 500 percent since March 2017, but May doesn’t have a “robust response” to the deaths those arms cause in Yemen. Americans unaware 
Remarkably, there was no significant public protest against Mohammad bin Salman during his visit to America. And it is probably no surprise. Senator Bernie Sanders, who led a failed attempt in the US Congress to cut American support for the war, lamented that many Americans are not even aware of Yemen’s plight, even less so of America’s role in it. The US not only arms the Saudis, but also provides air refueling and targeting for their warplanes. Many Americans are unaware that the people of Yemen are suffering today in a devastating civil war, or that U.S. forces have been actively engaged in support of the Saudi coalition in this war. https://t.co/hcOGRJGaAS pic.twitter.com/rr5BcyITta 
The American people are not to be blamed though. When their media consider “ Russiagate ” stories 50 times more newsworthy than the situation in Yemen, it takes a curious mind to become aware.
