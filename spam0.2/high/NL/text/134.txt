Safaricom partners Barclays Bank to launch financial service mobile app   09:27 CET | News 
Safaricom has partnered with Barclays Bank of Kenya to launch a financial self-service channel called Timiza Mobile app. Through the app, Safaricom users can acquire services that include quick mobile loans of up to KES 150,000 at an interest rate of 6.7 percent. Customers will also be able to deposit funds into their Timiza account through M-Pesa, pay utility bills, send and receive money directly to other Timiza users. 
Barclays Bank Kenya's managing director, Jeremy Awori, says the service is out to remove hurdles that young people, especially entrepreneurs, face when it comes to managing their finances. Timiza loans are repayable in 30 days, which Awori said they consider being quite attractive. Other services on the app include a transactional account, utility bill payment, insurance cover and withdrawing cash from the account to M-Pesa. To access the service, smartphone users need to download the Timiza app on Google Play store, and feature phone users only need to dial star 848 hash to access the service. 
As a first in the market, the Timiza account allows one to sign up for a last expense and personal accident cover of up to KES 40,000. The app also comes embedded with a taxi hailing option in partnership with LittleCab. There are plans to expand the app capabilities in the future to include a virtual pre-paid card which will enable customers to make online payments. Free Headlines in your E-mail
