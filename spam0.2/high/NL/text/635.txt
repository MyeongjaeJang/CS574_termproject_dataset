The MindSky National Rugby league resumed over the weekend, with three games being played. 
Defending champions Remera Buffaloes hammered Thousand Hills rugby club by 20-3 points in a game played at Utexrwa. It was the first defeat of the season for 1,000 Hills who had kept a clean sheet in the first two fixtures. 
Victory for the champions who duly used the power of their driving line out to score was a relief having lost the previous game to Kigali Sharks in the second game played days ago. 
The skillful and explosive Buffaloes players came to life near the break, scoring some quick tries as the Hills slipped below the standards they had set initially 
Buffalo’s president Benjamin Makobe had promised that they have to win to avoid a second successive defeat since they’re defending champions. 
“We played better, than the Hills this shows our objective this season.” 
For the Hills, the defeat was a disappointment as they look forward to avoiding another defeat when the second leg of the season kicks off after the break on March 24th. 
In the other games that were played, Risuzi Resilience rugby club won against Kamonyi Puma by 15-10, at Kamonyi while Muhanga rugby club faced off University of Rwanda Grizzlies 17-3 at Huye.   259 times! Share this:
