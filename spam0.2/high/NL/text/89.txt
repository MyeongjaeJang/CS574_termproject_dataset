Greek privatisation agency gets no offers for minority stake in OTE Monday 19 March 2018 | 08:04 CET | News 
Greeceâ€™s privatisation agency HRADF did not receive any bids for the sale of a 5 minority percent stake in OTE and invited Deutsche Telekom to exercise its right of first refusal to buy the shares, writes local paper Ekathimerini.com. As part of its international bailout, HRADF started an international tender in February to sell a 5.0 percent stake in OTE, corresponding to 24.5 million shares. 
The deadline for investors to submit offers was 15 March. Deutsche Telekom holds 40 percent of OTE's share capital, the Greek state holds 5 percent, and the HRADF owns 5 percent, while smaller percentages are held by foreign and local institutional and private investors.
