New Ordnance Survey GPS devices 22 March 2018 Ordnance Survey (OS) announced the launch of four new off-road OS GPS navigation devices for walking, hiking and off-road cycling. The innovative GPS units are a first for OS, and have been designed for ease-of-use straight out of the box. They boast the trusted accuracy that you would expect from Ordnance Survey, combined with advanced performance features. Covering the areas you choose, each device comes with up to 12 tiles of OS’s world-famous leisure mapping, giving access to up to 8,000 km2 of continually updated maps in either 1:50,000 or 1:25,000 scale. Durable and water-resistant, the devices come with features that track performance and have the added inbuilt safety tracking option “SeeMe”. Unique to these devices, SeeMe allows you and your specified contacts to know exactly where you are without the need of connecting to a separate mobile phone. The devices can also be synchronised with other services and add-ons (including OS’s multi-award-winning OS Maps app) to plot and share routes, or monitor heart rate, energy and speed. “At Ordnance Survey we are committed to encouraging more people to get outside more often by making the outdoors enjoyable, accessible and safe for all,” said Nick Giles, Managing Director of Ordnance Survey Leisure. “For a long time, our customers have asked for us to produce GPS devices, and now here they are. Traditionally GPS devices can be difficult to use, but using our experience with OS Maps we have designed these units with simplicity and ease-of-use in mind. Whether it’s our paper maps, digital mapping applications or these new GPS devices, OS is a trusted companion in the outdoors that’s relied in all off-road discovery and adventure, to keep people safe and on the right track.” Starting from £379.99, the devices are available at www.os.uk/gps
