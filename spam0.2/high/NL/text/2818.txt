TONJ - 22 Mar 2018 Four people killed including a chief in Tonj state 
At least four people were killed including a chief in Tonj South County during a revenge attack on Tuesday between two feuding communities in Tonj State. 
The latest attack follows the killing of a farmer named Piet Riak last week. 
Speaking to Radio Tamazuj on Wednesday, Tonj South County Commissioner Severino Philip Bazia said the incident occurred as tensions escalated between the Dinka and Luo communities in Tonj state. 
Philip noted that the state government has not yet arrested those involved in the killings and the incident should be treated as an isolated incident. Share this
