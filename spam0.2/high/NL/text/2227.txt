Emirates’ bittersweet landing in Oman March 22, 2018 7:10 am 
On March 20, 2018, a new terminal was inaugurated in Muscat. 
As reported by Times of Oman, the terminal covers a total area of 580,000 sqm, upgraded their security screening standards for passengers; installing smart biometric technology that tracks any unauthorized access, and implemented a terminal designed with energy conservation in mind. 
In commemoration of the new terminal, Emirates landed their special “Year of Zayed” aircraft first.

A flight to remember 
Today Emirates launched its special “Year of Zayed” from Dubai and landed on the new terminal as the first aircraft to do so. 
Currently, the airline operates three daily flights to Muscat, connecting Omani travelers to more than 150 global destinations, as per their claims. 
On SeatGuru, a Tripadvisor subsidiary, for reviewers around the world, users have posted mixed reviews. 
“I’m 177m, and I managed to sleep comfortably on this flight;” “Service was good.” 
But others have had their “feet stepped on,” while some have reported worse experiences.

A flight to forget 
The aircraft claims to be spacious, but reviews mentioned the opposite with seats being “too cramped;” “having terrible 2-3-2 configurations,” or added statements like “A budget airline would probably have been better;” 
One said: “I couldn’t complain about service as there wasn’t any,” and “you have to squeeze your precious stuff into the overhead lockers already occupied by crew’s equipment.” 
Emirates have been flying to Oman for just under 25 years. This year they will be marking their 25th year of successful operations to the country. 
After this, it looks like Emirates will need to address the challenges if it is to continue being successful over Omani skies. Previous Story
