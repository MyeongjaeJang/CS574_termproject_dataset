Facebook, Google, Big Switch Networks to demo open source collaboration  53 CET | News 
Big Switch Networks will present an OCP Summit keynote with Facebook and Google to demonstrate three different approaches to building Network Operating Systems (NOSs). Each of these approaches are built with Open Network Linux (ONL) and all are running on Open Compute Project (OCP) switch hardware. Big Switch is also introducing the ONL Certified Gold programme that provides continuous validation of ONL versions on designated britebox adopting ONL of complete code validation. 
Teams from the three organisations will demo Google’s NOS supporting P4 Runtime, Facebook’s FBOSS-based NOS and Big Switch’s BGP-based concept NOS. This demonstration highlights the breadth of innovation in large scale data centre networking, each is built with Open Network Linux as the foundational NOS component and running on OCP 100G open networking switch hardware. All three can perform Layer-3 networking (routing). The Google demo shows this with centralised SDN controllers and P4 programming, Facebook with the Thrift protocol, and the Big Switch with an industry-standard BGP protocol. 
Using modular, interchangeable software and hardware components, this demonstration points to multiple open source networking innovations, including open source programming model on ONL-based OCP switches; multiple open source forwarding agents on Open Network Linux, as well as multiple open source NOSs on ONL-based OCP switches.
