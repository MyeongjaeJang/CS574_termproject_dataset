Bruno Mars, The Weeknd top this year's Lollapalooza lineup news.avclub.com Fresh off of multiple Grammy wins and a contentious cultural-appropriation debate, Bruno Mars is set to headline this year’s Lollapalooza. He’ll be doing so alongside the equally Grammy-winning The Weeknd and Jack White, and the less winning, but equally mainstream, Arctic Monkeys. Overall, this year’s Lollapalooza lineup reflects how much Lollapalooza—and music in general—have changed since the early ‘90s: Although festival founder Perry Farrell is still hanging in there with his current band Perry Farrell’s Kind Heaven, “alt-rock” in its ‘90s incarnation is long dead, replaced by a diverse mix of genres dominated by indie rock and hip-hop acts.
