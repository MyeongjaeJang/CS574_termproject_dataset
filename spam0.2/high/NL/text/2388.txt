Cyfrowy Polsat EBITDA falls on higher revenues in Q4  12 CET | News 
The group Cyfrowy Polsat's revenues increased by 1.7 percent year-on-year to PLN 2.58 billion in Q4 2017. EBITDA fell by 3.3 percent to PLN 873 million, and the EBITDA margin was 33.8 percent in Q4 2017, down from 35.6 percent in Q3 2017 . The total RGUs remained unchanged at 16.52 million, but there was an increase in the contract customer base and the number of multiplay users. 
The main highlights for the year 2017, according to the group, were the maintenance of the audience of Polsat channels (24.5 percent) and dynamic growth in advertising revenues (5.1 percent to PLN 353 million in Q4); stable growth in the number of contract RGUs mainly due to the group's multiplay strategy; retaining high margins and reduction of debt, as well as high cash flow; and the strategic acquisition made in Q4 2017. 
The number of contract services increased by 3 percent year-on-year to 13.69 million at the end of 2017, after adding 160,000 during the fourth quarter. From the total contract RGUs, 6.9 million were mobile telephony services, 4.9 million pay-TV and 1.8 million internet services. The same numbers were reported as of the end of Q3 2017. 
The increase by 202,000 telephony RGUs compared to Q4 2016 was the positive effect of the multiplay strategy. The number of multiplay clients increased by 16 percent year-on-year to 1.51 million, using 4.52 million services. 
The increase in pay TV RGUs by 176,000 year-on-year was attributed to growth in multiroom and pay OTT services. The number of internet services increased by 52,000 year-on-year. 
The implementation of the Roam-Like-at-Home regulation in mid-2017 affected contract ARPU in Q4 2017, and the effect is expected to continue also in the first half of 2018. ARPU for Q4 2017 amounted to PLN 89. 
The pre-paid customer base decreased by 13 percent year-on-year to 2.84 million, but during the quarter remained relatively stable, losing only 40,000 customers compared to the end of Q3 2017. ARPU for prepaid users was reported at PLN 20.1, which is more than PLN 19.20 in Q4 2016 but slightly less than PLN 20.20 in Q3 2017. 
For this year, the group expects to continue with its strategy to maintain audience share and increase advertising revenues at a similar rate, reflecting the growth dynamics of the TV advertising market; to keep the growth rate of RGUs and multiplay services; to maintain the high margin; limit capex to a maximum 10 percent of revenues; keep the high level of FCF; complete the acquisition of Netia and start implementing the synergies planned for 2019 â€“ 2023; and to generate a ROI on new TV channels.
