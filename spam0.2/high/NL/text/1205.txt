  BFM sees increase in value of UK-manufactured furniture   
The total value of exports of UK-manufactured furniture increased by nearly +20% YoY in 2017, according to the latest overseas trade review by British Furniture Manufacturers ( BFM ). 
The report, based on the sector's performance throughout 2017, revealed that exports to the EU had risen by +19.6%, with similar percentage increases when categorised between EU and non-EU countries. 
Mike Dimond, BFM's director of employment and membership, says: "Despite improvement in the total value of exports, our review also highlights that the trade deficit between imports and exports of all furniture grew from £4.3b in 2016 to £4.6b in 2017. 
"It showed that all sectors reported an increase in export levels, with kitchen furniture reporting the highest level of overall growth at +50.5%, with exports to non-EU countries increasing by +86.6% and +6.1% to EU countries." 
The BFM report shows that within the EU, France is the favoured destination for exports of all UK-manufactured furniture, rising by +50% in the year to reach a value of £316m. 
However, in the traditional areas of furniture - apart from office and shop furniture - the Republic of Ireland topped all EU exporting destinations, with exports totalling £296m – an increase of +7% on 2016. 
Outside the EU, the US tops the table in every furniture category, showing a value of £645m, a rise of +21% in the year. However, exports to China rose by +78% to £147m, and Hong Kong by +107% to £96m. 
With regards to incoming product, the BFM notes that there was an +11% increase in furniture imports, with little difference between the performances of EU countries compared to non-EU countries. 
While China dominates in all sectors for imports from outside the EU - seeing an increase of +3% to reach a value of £2.1b - Italy topped the list of EU countries, with a rise of +15% over the year. 
However, the most notable improvement in imports came from the US, the value growing by +51% to £349m.
