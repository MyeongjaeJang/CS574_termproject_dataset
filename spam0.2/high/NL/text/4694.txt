Cisco to donate USD 50 mln to Santa Clara homelessness partnership   09:21 CET | News 
Cisco has announced a USD 50 million commitment over the next 5 years to Destination: Home, a public-private partnership thatâ€™s helping end homelessness in Santa Clara County. The aim is to use the money and existing public resources to build more housing for the most vulnerable residents, improve technology capacity across the homeless services sector and invest in evidence-based practices to most effectively help individuals and families in need of support and stability. In a statement, Cisco explained that even though Santa Clara County is home to Silicon Valley and some of the most prosperous communities in the US, some 7,400 people are without a home and 2,000 are considered chronically homeless, the third highest in the US. Cisco has already donated an initial USD 20 million to Destination: Home through its Cisco Fund at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation.
