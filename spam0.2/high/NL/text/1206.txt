  Bedmaker now Carbon Neutral   
Bed manufacturer Sleepeezee has been verified as a Carbon Neutral organisation. 
Clive Parry, sales & marketing director, comments: "At Sleepeezee, the entire team have been working hard to continually minimise our environmental impact. We are committed to using environmentally-friendly and sustainable materials in our products. As part of our carbon offsetting initiative, we are partnering with local schools in a tree-planting programme, which allows us to share with the children, the importance of sustainability and caring for our environment." 
Sustainability remains at the forefront of Sleepeezee’s practices. No waste generated from the manufacturing facility goes to landfill, and Sleepeezee is an active supporter of Princes Charles Campaign For Wool, which supports British sheep farmers and promotes the unique, natural, renewable and biodegradable benefits of wool. A number of Sleepeezee’s beds have achieved the Platinum Wool Label accreditation, which indicates that the product employs 100% British wool.
