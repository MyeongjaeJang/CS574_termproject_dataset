Verve partners with UBA to supply prepaid cards to Zambian farmers   09:33 CET | News 
Verve International has signed a partnership agreement with United Bank for Africa (UBA) to provide prepaid cards to farmers under the Zambian Ministry of Agriculture's FISP scheme. UBA will issue Verve Prepaid cards in the next season of the Farmers Input Support Programme (FISP), a state subsidy initiative to help farmers purchase agricultural inputs like fertiliser, seed and chemical at subsidised costs. 
Through the programme, the government intends to boost food production in the country by funding cards issued to each farmer with USD 170 while the farmers contribute USD 40 towards the purchase of farm inputs. Many farmers in the country have benefited from the programme since it started in 2015, and the government plans to extend it, with more than 1 million farmers expected to receive over USD 290 million in funding during the 2017/18 season. 
The company said that the introduction of Verve cards is expected to reduce card issuance costs by 30-50 percent and also save significantly on transaction fees. With its improved security feature, Verve will effectively solve the FISP transparency and accountability issues. Through this partnership, Zambia joins a growing list of African countries where Verve's EMV-compliant cards (Europay, Mastercard and Visa) are used and accepted.
