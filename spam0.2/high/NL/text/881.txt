Canada to create 5G corridor with CAD 400 mln from govt, tech firms Tuesday 20 March 2018 | 09:23 CET | News 
Canada wants to create a 5G corridor and will be investing over CAD 400 mln into the project, and into 5G research in general, CBCNews reported. The first CAD 200 million, for research, will come from the federal government, as well as from the governments of Ontario and Quebec. Another CAD 200 million will come from companies such as Ericsson, Ciena Canada, Thales Canada, IBM and CGI. This money will go to getting the corridor, and its facilities, up and running. 
The idea is to establish a network of linked research facilities and laboratories that companies will be able to use for the testing of products and services that run on 5G. As many as 1,000 companies across Canada will take part in the corridor, which will be called ENCQOR, or Evolution of Networked Services through a Corridor in Quebec and Ontario for Research and Innovation. 
This comes on top of company plans to deploy their own 5G networks. Rogers has outfitted the entire Rogers Centre with dozens of 5G antennas. Bell and Telus are working on similar plans to test and build their own networks . Free Headlines in your E-mail
