19 March 2018, 16:05 Observers achieve transparent elections at some Chechen polling stations 
Today, the Chechen CEC has reported that following the results for processing of 100% of the protocols from polling stations, the voter turnout at the presidential election reached 91.54%. Observers reported violations. Besides, they also claimed that at their polling stations, the actual turnout was 2-3 times less than the officially announced one. 
On March 18, the voting took place at the presidential election in Russia . According to preliminary results, Vladimir Putin gained 91.44% of the votes in Chechnya . 
In Grozny, the voting day culminated in two major results, one of which was the detection by observers of a real turnout of voters at several polling stations, the "Novaya Gazeta" reports today. The edition refers to the PEC (precinct election commission) No. 427 in Yablochnaya Street, where the turnout was 35%, and the PEC No. 386 in Batyzhev Street, where the turnout was 36%. 
"For the whole Chechnya, several 'clean' polling stations are a drop. However, the price of those several honest protocols is terribly high. They prove to us that this is possible also in Chechnya. They 'unmask' Chechnya and bring it closer to Russia," the article reads. 
According to the "Novaya Gazeta", the second important result is in fact that none of the observers suffered during the voting in Grozny. 
The list of violations registered by observers is quite expected, the "Novaya Gazeta" reports. The newspaper notes that "somewhere, 'carousels' were noticed, some members of election commissions tried to give out additional bulletins to voters, and when an observer tried to record those violations on video, a policeman tried to seize a video camera."
