Ecotel's FY revenues rise, EBITDA stable in 2017   13:25 CET | News 
German network operator Ecotel said it saw growth in all of its business segments over 2017, with total revenues rising to EUR 120.6 million from EUR 116.6 million for 2016. Gross profits increase from EUR 28.4 million in 2016 to EUR 29.9 million in 2017, while Ecotel’s gross profit margin fell slightly to 47.7 percent from 47.9 percent the previous year. Ecotel’s B2B business posted substantial revenue growth of 5 percent last year, bringing revenues to EUR 47.6 million and continuing the previous years’ upward trend. The company’s Easybell segment likewise saw sales increase to EUR 15.2 million, thanks partially to positive developments in sales of NGN-voice services to small businesses. Ecotel’s Nacamar segment saw its revenues return to growth and reach EUR 2 million thanks to its new strategy of providing services to German public radio broadcasters. Ecotel’s wholesale business also saw revenues increase slightly to EUR 55.8 million in 2017, up from EUR 54.5 million one year previously. 
As expected , Ecotel’s EBITDA was flat at EUR 7 million due to temporarily higher expenditures in personnel and technical resources as well as system and process adjustments resulting from the switch to its new all-IP-based product portfolio, it said. The company’s net profit also fell to EUR 500,000, down from EUR 800,000 as a result of accompanying investments in more powerful equipment. Profits per share fell to EUR 0.13 per share in 2017, down from EUR 0.24 per share the year before. 
Ecotel’s management and supervisory boards will recommend a dividend payout of 100 percent (EUR 0.13 per share) at its annual meeting due to positive business developments and balance sheet figures. Going forward, Ecotel said it expects positive margin effects thanks to the growing share of its NGN business and accompanying value-added effects. Revenues are expected to fall to between EUR 90 and 120 million for 2018, with an EBITDA of between EUR 7 and 8 million amid a slightly higher gross profit margin and thus higher gross profit in its B2B segment. Still, the company expects that investments in new equipment will continue to impact its free cash flow.
