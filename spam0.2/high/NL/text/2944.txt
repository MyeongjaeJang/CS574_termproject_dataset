Record, record on the wall, which watch is the slimmest of them all? The Bulgari Octo Finissimo Tourbillon with 1.95mm thick caliber BVL 268 set a record for ultra-thin tourbillons in 2014. 
Than, in 2017 Bulgari established another record with the the 5.15mm thin Octo Finissimo Automatique for the thinnest self-winding watch with a conventional movement. And now the brand set a new record again, with the Outstanding Bulgari Octo Finissimo Tourbillon Automatic. As part of the secret, which could not really be a secret because the movement is visible to save fractions of millimeters, the new Bulgari Octo Finissimo Tourbillon Automatic is powered by the new caliber BVL 288, a self-winding flying tourbillon movement of only 1.95mm thick. A tremendous technical achievement.
