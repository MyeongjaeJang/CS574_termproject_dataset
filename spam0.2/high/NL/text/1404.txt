Another Irish fighter announced for Jacobs-Sulecki undercard By Joe O'Neill   Headline News 
Katie Taylor [8(4)-0] will have some Irish company when she seeks to unify world titles in New York next month. 
The Bray lightweight puts her WBA title on the line against Argentina’s IBF titlist Victoria Noelia Bustos [18(0)-4(0)] at the Barclays Centre in Brooklyn on the Danny Jacobs v Maciej Sulecki on Saturday April 28th. 
Cork middleweight Spike O’Sullivan had been the preferred headline opponent for Jacobs but will instead box in Las Vegas on Friday May 4th as he builds towards a clash with Canelo Alvarez in September. However, there will still be a distinctly Irish flavour to the card following the confirmation today that Monaghan light welterweight Larry Fryers [6(2)-0] will feature on the bill. Widgets Magazine 
Based in East Durham in Upstate New York, ‘Lethal Larry’ will be boxing for the first time in 2018 and the big ticket-seller will be hoping to build on a career-best win over the previously undefeated Charles Natal in December on a DiBella Entertainment show. 
Fryers said that “after some setbacks so far this year I’m finally going to get up and running. To say I’m over the moon is an understatement, I just can’t wait to get in the ring and pick up where I left off last year. Roll on the 28th – I look forward to entertaining you once again!” 
The 27-year-old will fight in a six-round bout against a to-be-confirmed opponent. 
Also featuring on the undercard next month will be a heavyweight clash between Jarrell Miller and Johann Duhaupas, a light welterweight bout between Shohjahon Ergashev and Zhimin Wang, as well as appearances for Julian Sosa, Dimash Niyazov, and the debut of Olympic gold medalist Daniyar Yeleussinov.
