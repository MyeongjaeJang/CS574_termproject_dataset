JUBA - 23 Mar 2018 Taban Deng says US sanctions will not affect oil sector 
South Sudan’s government said on Friday the latest US sanctions on 15 oil-related entities over the ongoing civil war would not affect the oil sector in the world’s youngest nation. 
President Kiir’s first deputy Taban Deng Gai said in a press statement after meeting Kiir that the American decision placing sanctions on South Sudanese oil-linked operators would not affect the country’s economic situation. 
Gai said the imposed restrictions on the 15 companies by the US Department of Commerce's Entity is irrelevant, pointing out that those South Sudanese companies do not have business dealings with US institutions. “There, it has no impact on the situation in the country,” he said. 
The Commerce Department also placed the South Sudan Ministry of Mining and the South Sudan Ministry of Petroleum on its list. 
The other companies include Ascom Sudd Operating Company, Dar Petroleum Operating Company, DietsmannNile, Greater Pioneer Operating Co.Ltd, Juba Petrotech Technical Services Ltd, Nile Delta Petroleum Company, Nile Drilling and Services Company, Nile Petroleum Corporation, Nyakek and Sons, Oranto Petroleum, Safinat Group and SIPET Engineering and Consultancy Services as well as the Sudd Petroleum Operating Co. 
Those on the list "are involved in activities that are contrary to the foreign policy interests of the United States," according to a Department of Commerce document published on March 21. 
The Trump administration said those South Sudanese entities were substantial sources of revenues for the government, accusing the government of using those entities to fund violence. Share this
