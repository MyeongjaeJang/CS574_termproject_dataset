Telecom Italia rolls out TIMpersonal m-banking service   12:27 CET | News 
Telecom Italia has announced the details of a new mobile payment service developed by the Banca Sella Group called TIMpersonal that’s been officially available in Italy since the start of March. The service takes the form of a virtual prepaid Mastercard card that combines a financial product with mobile services. After downloading the free TIMpersonal “powered by Hype” app , users over the age of 12 simply need to take a selfie for recognition purposes so that they can use their smartphone to check bank balances, make peer to peer payments, pay in affiliated stores and top up their credit. Customers can also request a physical card to use for purchases in contactless mode and withdraw money free of charge from any ATM. 
TIM said it will provide 1GB of data traffic a month for the first year to those who use the TIMpersonal app to manage their card. Minors will need parental authorisation to use the app, which comes with parental control functions so that parents or guardians can monitor all movements. The operator added that TIMpersonal will also enable customers to use their phone credit to buy tickets for public transport, park their vehicles, access limited traffic areas or rent electric cars in many Italian cities.
