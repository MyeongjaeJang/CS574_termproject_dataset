EU sanctions USD 52 million grant for peace and security in the Horn of Africa March 24, 2018 
The European Union has sanctioned USD 52 million grant to support peace and security programs in the Horn of Africa region that includes Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritrea. 
The four-year program which the grant will fund comprises: Improving IGAD’s early warning for conflict and its response mechanism. Enabling cooperation between IGAD and national governments of the region. Enhancing the skills of IGAD and national governments in the regions for preventive diplomacy and mediation. Capacity building and core staffing for IGAD’s peace and security division. 
Mahboub Maalim, the executive secretary of Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) said, “The support will be critical in building the capacity of IGAD’s core peace and security programs in preventive diplomacy, trans-national security, counter-terrorism and mediation and enable us to better handle the complex peace and security challenges faced by the region.” 
The IGAD is an eight-country trade bloc in Africa. It includes governments from the Horn of Africa, Nile Valley, and the African Great Lakes. It has been mediating the peace process of the conflict in South Sudan since mid-December 2013. 
Ranieri Sabatucci, ambassador of the EU delegation to African Union told Anadolu Agency, “We understand that peace and security are the responsibilities of Africans, of the continent and of the region. So we look for partners who are responsible for that, who will have to do the work in order to promote this process. We are happy to be there supporting it.” 
“But we cannot want peace more than the people want it, more than the people, more than the institutions, more than the government and if they want it, of course peace can take place. The best we can do is to support it.” He further added. SHARE
