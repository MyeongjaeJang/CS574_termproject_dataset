Telkom raises ZAR 1 bln to invest in network   08:14 CET | News 
South Africa’s Telkom raised ZAR 1 billion during its first debt issue of the year, as it looks to invest in its network and take on rivals including MTN Group and Vodacom Group, reports Bloomberg. After a five-year hiatus, Telkom started selling debt again in 2017 and has raised ZAR 4.3 billion from nine bond offerings in twelve months. The company has significantly increased capital expenditure in recent years to focus on its mobile-phone business, which reported a maiden profit in 2016 as landline use declines. 
The most recent bond sales included a ZAR 654 million floating-rate note maturing in March 2019 and a ZAR 346 million bond with a 7.84 percent coupon, maturing on 21 September. 
Telkom has sold bonds to diversify its funding sources and reduce the cost of borrowing, a spokesman said. The company is almost 40 percent owned by the South African government. While Telkom’s mobile-phone business trails MTN, Vodacom and Cell C in Africa’s most industrialized economy, the unit is adding customers and needs investment to cope with the additional traffic. That has put some strain on the company’s cash reserves. The operator is also expanding in broadband services, especially to corporate customers, following the acquisition of Business Connexion in 2016.
