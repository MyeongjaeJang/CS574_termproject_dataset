US passes Cloud Act giving police access to data stored abroad Monday 26 March 2018 | 12:29 CET | News 
The US Congress has approved legislation giving law enforcement officials the right to request access to data stored abroad by US-based service providers. The so-called Cloud Act was included in a USD 1.3 trillion spending bill passed at the last minute to avoid a US government shutdown and later signed into law by President Trump. 
The legislation seeks to alleviate a recurring problem in lawsuits, where police are unable to access data on suspects from communication service providers because it is stored on servers outside the US. Microsoft notably won a case in 2016 against the US government seeking access to emails stored on the company's servers in Dublin. The government has appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court . Microsoft welcomed the passage of the Cloud Act, saying it provides legal clarity going forward. 
Service providers will still be able to appeal against US warrants for access to foreign data, based on their need to comply with foreign data protection law. 
The Cloud Act also gives the American executive branch the power to enter into bilateral agreements with foreign governments on the exchange of personal data for law enforcement purposes. This removes the need for Congressional approval of Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties, which are the normal procedure for regulating data exchanges with foreign police. Free Headlines in your E-mail
