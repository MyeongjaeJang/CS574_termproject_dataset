  D&D London reveals first glimpse of new opening D&D London has revealed a first glimpse of Bluebird Café, which is set to open its doors on 11th April in the heart of the mighty £8 billion Television Centre regeneration.   café ’s vibrant interior has been designed by David d’Almada’s Sagrada and incorporates a mix of British styling from the 1960s and modern Bluebird Chelsea glamour. 
The artwork has been sourced by Fraser Scott and includes works by young British artists as well as colourful designs inspired by Bridget Riley and Celia Birtwell. 
Alongside the café and bar, a spacious all-year-round terrace looking over the Television Centre’s famous circular core is set to rival that of the Chelsea original. 
Further details on Executive Chef Simon Gregory’s modern European menu have also been announced, with signature dishes including Calabrian nduja crusted yellow fin tuna with grilled onion and green sauce, and a Crispy Goosnargh duck and watercress salad. 
Bluebird classics such as Spiced Atlantic king prawns with lemon yoghurt and pistachio will also feature, whilst award-winning Executive Pastry Chef, Roger Pizey, offers a sweet-toothed nod to the Kings Road with a Chelsea chocolate cheesecake and orange sorbet. 
The new Bluebird Café marks the beginning of a wider rollout of the celebrated Chelsea restaurant and café – a landmark on the Kings Road for the past 20 years. The next stop for this Chelsea jetsetter being New York.
