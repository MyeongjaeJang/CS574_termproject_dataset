FCC confirms plans to block certain suppliers from USF on security concerns Monday 26 March 2018 | 16:38 CET | News 
The US Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai has confirmed a proposal to block certain equipment suppliers from benefiting from funds for universal service in the US. If approved by the full FCC at its meeting next month, the measure would stop US operators from buying equipment from suppliers deemed a threat to US national security, such as China's Huawei Technologies and ZTE. 
Pai said in a statement that "virtually any" telecommunications equipment could have a "hidden back door" that could allow hostile governments "to inject viruses, launch denial-of-service attacks, steal data, and more". The FCC "must and will play our part in a government- and industry-wide effort to protect the security of our networks", he said. 
The US Universal Service Fund is worth USD 8.5 billion a year to operators to bring services to rural and low-income households. The funds are collected as a levy on revenues generated by telecom operators, which most often pass on the cost to customers as an item on their service invoices. 
While Pai did not name Huawei and ZTE in his statement, the companies are already the subject of draft legislation banning their use by US government agencies due to national security concerns. Government officials have also reportedly put pressure on telecom operators to not distribute phones from the Chinese companies. Huawei and ZTE have denied the allegations of close ties to the Chinese government and military. Free Headlines in your E-mail
