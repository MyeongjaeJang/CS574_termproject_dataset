Telefonica Deutschland's startup incubator Wayra and Volkswagen's Data Lab announced that they have selected the Spanish car-sharing startup Eccocar to receive support from their subsidy programme as part of a cross-industry technology project. Eccocar is set to receive financial support from both companies as well as work alongside the two firms to implement a joint technology project, said Telefonica.
