Eighty-five percent of mid-sized German IT firms expect revenue growth in 2018  43 CET | News 
A total of 85 percent of Germany's medium-sized IT companies expect their revenues will continue to increase during the first half of 2018, according to a new representative survey from German digital association Bitkom. It said 13 percent of firms expect revenues will remain constant, while only 3 percent are expecting revenue losses in this period. 
Bitkom said these projections are in line with previous years, given that revenues increased 9 percent last year for firms in the industry to a total of EUR 68 billion, while the number of people employed by mid-sized IT firms grew by 31,422 to 422,155. Bitkom questioned 701 mid-sized IT firms with between three and 499 employees as part of its survey.
