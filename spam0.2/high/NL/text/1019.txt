One in seven councillors quits early According to BNR radio, one in seven of the 1,300 local councillors elected in 2014 quit before their term in office was up. Most left because being a councillor took too much time, others were offered a job which made it impossible to do both, had a political difference of opinion with their fellow party members or had health issues. 
Fewer women on the right Research by the Volkskrant suggests that the more right wing a political party actually is, the fewer women it has on its election list. And the pro-animal PvdD is the only party to have more women than men as candidates. Bottom of the list is the fundamentalist Protestant SGP , which considers women should not vote anyway.
