CVDK Hypernova Black Guilloche CVDK Hypernova Black Guilloche 
Let’s take a little time to talk about an astronomical brand, the only atelier in the world which is totally dedicated to designing and manufacturing hand-made astronomical watches. 
Yes, a niche player in all the Baselworld fuss, but therefore no less phenomenal. The 2018 collection of the Dutch brand Christiaan van der Klaauw contains 5 new models. Most astronomical in our opinion is the Hypernova Black Guilloche. The CVDK Hypernova with its beautiful new black guilloched dial does not only combine a full chronograph with a day/night indication, an ingenious date display and a Super-LumiNova moon phase indication, but also style and uniqueness. When the Moon at 6 o’clock is left of the centre, it is in its first quarter. When the Moon is in the centre, it is full Moon and right of the centre, the moon is in its last quarter. If the Moon is not visible at all, it is New Moon. Automatic winding movement in a high steel 44mm case. The rotor is based on the ‘Sun with 12 Claws’, the logo of Christiaan van der Klaauw.
