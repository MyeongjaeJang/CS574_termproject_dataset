The incident occurred at the South Asia Pakistan Terminals facility in the Port of Karachi, where officials say approximately 55 to 60 containers fell into the water as a result of the incident, according to local media. 
Some video posted online of the incident showed a Hapag-Lloyd container ship make contact moored vessel as it was berthing. A second video showed several containers in the water shortly after the incident, including one that sank right at the quayside.
