Someone tried to hack the Facebook page and website of Katwijk political party DURF on Tuesday and Wednesday, the party said on Facebook. 
For a short time the DURF Facebook page showed a post calling on voters to vote for 'another party'. Someone also tried to log in to the party website from different accounts. DURF doesn't know who is behind the hack. 
"This is undermining local democracy", the party writes on Facebook. "It is unacceptable. This manipulation is a disgrace and a slap in the face for all the people who are going to cast their vote today." Tags:
