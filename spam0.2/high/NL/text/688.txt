このゲームについて Zak’s back!Three years after the events of Cyberia, Zak wakes up from a cryo-sleep, only to find out that his mission is not over yet. There is a new deadly weapon developed from the remains of the Cyberia project. There is a new fanatic leader who will stop at nothing to gain absolute control over humanity... Zak must put his cyberhero skills to the ultimate test! Randomized gameplay - so it's never the same game twice. Action that moves... you can't just shoot your way out of this. Blackout-inducing G-force flying and driving, but don't just hang on or you won't make it. システム要件
