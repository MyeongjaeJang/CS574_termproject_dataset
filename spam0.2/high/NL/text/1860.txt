  Award success for Feather and Springs   
Bedmaker Feather and Springs has been awarded the winner of the Cumbria Family Business One To Watch Award 2018. 
The family-run business launched in November 2016 with a showroom in Kendal and has quickly expanded to having retail outlets in Lancaster, Morecambe and an expanded space on Dockray Hall, Kendal. All products are made by the company's specialist team based in Morecambe, which hand-crafts mattresses, bed bases, linen and bedding accessories for local homes and hotels. 
“We are thrilled to have won the award,” says director Chris Cannon. “2017 was a fantastic year for the business, so it is really exciting for the team and everyone who is involved with Feather and Springs to see this recognised by the judges. In the last 12 months we have seen sales grow strongly due to awareness of our brand spreading, and it shows no signs of slowing down! I think our customers really like the fact we are a true family business that make the product ourselves, and that has helped the company grow at the rate we have.” 
The company has grown to a team of 15 people and has plans to add more staff this year, as well as expanding into further retail locations throughout the North-west.
