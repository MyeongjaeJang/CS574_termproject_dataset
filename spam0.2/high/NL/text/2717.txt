January Furniture Show and the LIA ( Lighting Industry Association ) have announced a new collaboration, Light, which will deliver a comprehensive lighting event within the next exhibition, which will take place at the Birmingham NEC from 20th-23rd January 2019. 
The Light decorative lighting event will enable buyers to access a wider range of lighting products than those previously available at the show, complementing the core furniture and interiors content. 
With a history dating back to 1939, the LIA is headquartered in Telford, and is Europe’s largest trade association for lighting equipment professionals, incorporating lighting manufacturers, suppliers, retailers, wholesalers, designers and other professionals active in the UK lighting market. 
Peter Hunt, COO of the LIA, comments: “We are delighted to be returning to an event that offers lighting and furniture buyers a truly compelling product offering. As innovation integrates lighting ever more closely into the modern home, this new show will be an essential platform for our members to meet key buyers from the widest possible audience across the world of furniture and interiors. 
"Clarion Events’ increasing investment in the January Furniture Show is set to deliver a game-changing event for our sector and for those furniture and interiors retailers looking to widen their offering.” 
Cleere Scamell, event director, adds: “Light is the most natural of fits, and as part of our investment in the ever-strengthening January Furniture Show, we will be working very closely with The LIA team and their members to deliver the strongest-ever reasons for lighting buyers to attend. This collaboration will further enhance the UK’s landmark event for the furniture and interiors market.” 
The lighting companies exhibiting at Light will be announced in the coming months.
