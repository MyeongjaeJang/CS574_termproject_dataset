Donald Trump is now preparing for war against Iran and possibly North Korea. The time to act is right now!
By appointing John Bolton as the new National Security Advisor, Trump has rounded out his “war cabinet” to include war hawk Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State and Gina ('I love torture') Haspel.
Beleaguered by political crisis on the home front, Trump is now positioning himself to launch a major war drive against Iran. The United States' imperial junior partners in Europe are already bowing before Trump. Having assembled a new “war cabinet,” Trump will withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), known as the Iran nuclear deal, in the next seven weeks, setting into motion a new confrontation with Iran.
This is madness but it is happening. Iran and North Korea are in the crosshairs.
Less than a month ago, John Bolton wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal titled, "The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First." In it, he laid out the case for a devastating first strike against the DPRK (North Korea). The major progress towards peace in Korea that has been made since January could very rapidly be rolled back.
This is the time to act with urgency. The people can stop Trump. Join us on April 14 at 12:00 p.m. in front of the White House for a major demonstration followed by a teach-in at George Washington University. This is part of a national day of coordinated anti-war actions that are taking place around the country.
Support and join in with the work of the ANSWER Coalition. We are working non-stop in an all-out mobilization to stop the Trump administration's sprint to war.
