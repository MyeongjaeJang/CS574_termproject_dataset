Today, Netflix announced that their upcoming original series Sacred Games, which stars Saif Ali Khan and Nawazzudin Siddique will premiere on July 6, 2018 in all territories where Netflix is available. 
A policeman, a criminal overlord, a Bollywood film star, politicians, cultists, spies, and terroristsâ€”the lives of the privileged, the famous, the wretched, and the bloodthirsty interweave with cataclysmic consequences amid the chaos of modern-day Mumbai. The series is based on the critically-acclaimed best-selling novel Sacred Games by author Vikram Chandra. 
The series focuses on Sartaj Singh, a seasoned and cynical Bombay police officer, summoned by an anonymous tip one morning, a voice which promises him an opportunity to capture the powerful Ganesh Gaitonde, criminal overlord of the G-Company. As the stakes mount and Sartaj seeks knowledge of his prey, it becomes clear that the game the two players thought they were engaged in is in fact part of a much larger scenario, one that expands beyond their city. 
Directed by Anurag Kashyap and Vikramaditya Motwane and produced by Phantom Films, the series also stars Radhika Apte. Share this:
