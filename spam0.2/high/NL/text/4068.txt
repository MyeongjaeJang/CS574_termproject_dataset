Allianz realigns its global brand management together with Interbrand -Allianz chooses Interbrand as the first global partner of a new agency model -Focus on balance between best-possible local business support and global consistency in brand management -Interbrand impressed with its strongly analytical and forward-looking approach Cologne/Munich – WEBWIRE – Friday, March 23, 2018 
Interbrand will support the insurance and finance groups global brand management activities in future and play a major role in shaping its brand management strategy. It will also advise the national Allianz companies on the best-possible use of the brand and establish an integrated Brand Stewardship Team together with Allianz SE. 
This separation of brand management and creative agency responsibilities is part of a new Allianz SE agency model. Allianz has moved away from the concept of a single exclusive lead agency, as this model no longer meets the requirements of the companys diverse communication activities. 
The growing complexity of brand communication calls for increasingly nuanced communication channels and content. We are now responding to this with a changed agency set-up  away from a single agency network and toward a larger number of specialists who we coordinate ourselves and manage centrally. This gives us maximum flexibility to cover all global and national needs while maintaining a clear focus on strategic brand development, said Christian Deuringer, Head of Global Brand Communication at Allianz SE. 
Interbrands role will firstly be to develop and identify the optimal skills, processes, structures and tools for Allianzs future global brand management. Secondly, Interbrand will be responsible for operational brand management in a joint team together with Allianz SE staff and in close collaboration with the national companies. 
We are thrilled to be able to support Allianz with our combination of skills in the strategic management of global brands and the establishment of the corresponding marketing capabilities, stated Nina Oswald, European Practice Lead for this topic at Interbrand . 
Simon Thun, CEO of Interbrand Central and Eastern Europe, added : With its new agency and management model, Allianz is taking a path which is important for globally operating brands: the positioning and visual identity of a brand are not an end in themselves, but must also provide tangible support for the respective local business. This requires a brand management approach which is both targeted and flexible with regard to interaction between HQ and the national companies.
