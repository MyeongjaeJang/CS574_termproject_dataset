0 Credit: Getty Images T he case between the Spanish Treasury and Cristiano Ronaldo looked like it could be closed within the coming days. 
In a bid to put it all behind him, Ronaldo has reportedly made an offer of payment to the tax agency to avoid further criminal proceedings. 
According to El Mundo, the Real Madrid star has agreed to pay the Treasury an amount that they feel is fair based on the non-taxation of his image rights, in order to ensure he would serve no prison time. 
However Europa Press state that a meeting in the past few months resulted in an ‘unsatisfactory’ offer of around 4-5 million euros, which was rejected by the Treasury. 
The Prosecutor’s Office attributed a fraud of 14.7m euros against the player, with the Treasury claiming that he should currently be serving a prison sentence due to four separate incidents.
