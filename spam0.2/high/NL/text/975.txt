“It is not good for us and our community as all these expired goods are been dumped here and this will affect our children as they will be forced to play with and eat them. Right now some of the community members are sick from diarrhea,” said Ayong. 
Another resident Margetta Naboi said some people have taken advantage of the site. She said recently people have been visiting the site to excavate the expired goods for resale and consumption. 
Naboi urged those using the dump site and the state government to find solutions to the issue to avoid a possible disease outbreak.
