Cost effectiveness is a key factor that drove many successes in a well established company. With ICY DOCK’s ToughArmor series removable 2.5″ SSD / HDD enclosures, we are introducing a different kind of cost effectiveness or we called it “space efficiency” by creating flexible configurations for data drives in a standard drive bay as seen in many HP and DELL workstations or servers. Whether you need to add 8 x 4TB 2.5″ SATA SSD in a single 5.25″ bay of your HP workstation, or replace the slim optical disk drive with hot-swappable 2.5″ HDD/SSD bay, the ToughArmor got you covered! 
Key features of ICY DOCK ToughArmor series: 
– Ruggedized Full Metal Construction– Heavy Duty Removable Drive Caddy– High Storage Density Design for Space Saving– Approved and Used by First Tier Company such as HP and GE– Complimentary Technical Support with 3-Year Warranty

The removable drive caddy allows enterprise users to quickly swap out the NVMe drives without opening the entire system case which makes system maintenance convenient.
