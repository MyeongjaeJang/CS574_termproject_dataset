National Geographic And Sprint Announce Winner Of Chasing Genius: Unlimited Innovation  Awards $25,000 Prize To Turn Idea Into Catalyst For Change In The World WASHINGTON, D.C. and OVERLAND PARK, Kan.   
National Geographic and Sprint are proud to announce Asha Gummadi as the winner of the  CHASING GENIUS: Unlimited Innovation  challenge, which aimed at inspiring innovative ideas focused on wireless connectivity and the network of the future. Based in Philadelphia, Asha Gummadi garnered the most votes on the CHASING GENIUS platform for her idea on Empowering Tele Rehabilitation with Digital Connectivity , and will receive $25,000 to take her vision further. 
The CHASING GENIUS: Unlimited Innovation challenge began in January as the second challenge in National Geographics growing CHASING GENIUS franchise, a groundbreaking digital initiative built on the premise that transformational ideas can come from anywhere, and from anyone. Inspiring people all over the globe, the CHASING GENIUS community unleashed more than one thousand potential solutions to leverage technology and the power of connectivity to imagine a better world. 
Ashas project is a smartphone app that allows doctors to digitally prescribe physical therapy exercises to patients in developing countries who cant easily access rehab centers or treatment. To ensure patients can learn their exercises remotely, the app demonstrates each movement via detailed animations, and allows patients to choose their own language for instructions. A neurological physical therapist, Asha was inspired to create the app after she could not effectively recommend exercises to her mother due to a language barrier, and after her grandfather couldnt access much-needed rehab services in rural India.

Launched last spring, the CHASING GENIUS platform brings together a community of active, aspirational, socially conscious consumers who want to make a positive difference in the world. Through the platform, challenges are presented to the community in an effort to foster and grow innovative ideas around some of the most pressing issues facing our planet. 
Since the challenge began, the CHASING GENIUS community has grown to 35,000 members. The concept of transformational ideas and CHASING GENIUS reverberated across social, digital and broadcast media and generated more than 100 million impressions, seven million content views, and 229,000* social conversations. 
During the submissions phase, the community was highly engaged  sharing ideas, offering feedback, asking questions, and flagging favorites. The submissions were then evaluated on four criteria to find the most inspiring, innovative, creative, and viable ideas. After the members of the CHASING GENIUS: Unlimited Innovation Council determined the top 10 finalists, the CHASING GENIUS community cast their votes to elect the winning idea. 
By way of this CHASING GENIUS challenge  and those that will follow  we want to prove to consumers around the world that the term explorer isnt confined to one meaning. Its the curiosity, creativity and perseverance put into each submission that sparks the explorer in each of us, said Claudia Malley, executive vice president, partner solutions, National Geographic. Our work here with Sprint has proven that theory and has shown us that transformative ideas can truly come from anyone, and anywhere. 
We all have the ability to be a catalyst for positive global change, and it was inspiring to see so many people share their passion for technology and innovation through the National Geographic Chasing Genius platform, said Dr. John Saw, Chief Technology Officer, Sprint. We congratulate all of the finalists, along with Asha Gummadi, and we cant wait to see where their ideas take them next. 
Council members who played a role in reviewing submissions include Eric Berkenpas, engineer and Sr. Director of Exploration Technology at National Geographic; Victoria Jaggard, Online Science and Innovation News Editor for National Geographic; Tan Le, Founder & CEO of EMOTIV; Dr. John Saw, Sprint CTO; and Albert Yu-Min-Lin, research scientist and engineer focused on technology-enabled exploration and crowdsourcing. Select council members have been chosen for their ability to make the impossible possible and for their visions of making the world a better place.
