Amdocs collaborates with Microsoft to enable ONAP on Microsoft Azure   09:37 CET | News 
Amdocs said it implemented Open Network Automation Platform (ONAP) on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. This new development enables operators to deliver virtual network services running on Azure, orchestrated and managed using ONAP. Amdocs and Microsoft will show the ways in which operators can gain the time-to-market and cost benefits of public clouds with a demonstration of ONAP running on Azure at the Linux Foundationâ€™s Open Network Summit in Los Angeles which takes place on 26-29 March. 
Amdocs said it's working with Microsoft to make the ONAP code available to the open source community in May. Network operators will then be able to offer network services running on Azure as the primary cloud or as complementary capacity for their private cloud to deploy virtual network functions that are managed and orchestrated by ONAP, Amdocs said in a press release.
