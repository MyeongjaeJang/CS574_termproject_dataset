If you want to organically grow your Instagram audience quickly, I have done the research for you and found the solution. Sounds too good to be true, right? 
I first heard about Upleap when reading this article about Bloomberg journalist, Max Chafkin’s, experience of growing his account from 212 to 1,400 followers in just a month. It broke down everything he did, from types of content to hashtags and analysing influencers. 
I clicked on literally every single suggested link out of pure curiously, but the one that caught my eye most of all was Upleap . Upleap is an account management service which works to grow your Instagram in an organic way. Here is how it works: You are assigned an account manager. This is an actual person. My Insta manager is called Mia. 2. You tell your account manager all about you and your account, including hashtags to focus on, influencers whose audiences you’d like to target, the location of the audience you want to target, and so on. This is great if you have a specific audience you want to focus on. For example, if you own a smoothie shop in Bali, a new poke place in Cali, or you run a lifestyle blog in London you can work with your account manager to make sure you are reaching this exact audience. Once you have this nailed, then it’s over to Mia. Or John. Or Sarah… They will start by liking and commenting on posts by your target audience and therefore creating an awareness of your account and brand. This organically encourages other Insta users to follow you and engage with your posts. This naturally promotes your posts, as the Instagram algorithm takes into account engagement — circularly increasing your growth further. That’s it! #simples.
