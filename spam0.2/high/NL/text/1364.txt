Bsim Categories About Us bsimracing originated out of a long term passion for Motorsports and Virtual racing. After having managed a few leagues, i decided to start a website that covered news and interesting topics within the Sim Racing scene. While it started out as a little and modest project, bsimracing.com has grown into an up to date community recourse website and receives a substantial amount of visitors on a daily basis. Bsimracing is powered by: Report News

With the growing success of the website and the ever growing traffic that comes with it, also monthly costs increase. 
Because bsimracing is a passion driven website and is not targeted as a commercial project, i have to rely on donations, and advertising to keep this site alive.
