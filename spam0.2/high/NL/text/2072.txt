COIMBATORE: Farmers from Mathampatti thanked Siruthuli and Root Group of Companies for helping them overcome water scarcity. 
Talking to reporters at a press meet, organised by Siruthuli, the farmers, led by K. Rajendran, said if not for their efforts and hard work, there would have been no trace of water across Coimbatore. 
Explaining how they undertook the cleaning of Kumaran Kuttai, Managing Trustee of Siruthuli Vanitha Mohan said the organisation was engaged in restoring the Noyyal river and desilting Kumaran Kuttai. 
Siruthuli, formed in 2003, at a time when Coimbatore was about to face a severe water scarcity. “The Corporation was clueless as the water level was only 1000-1200 feet in various dams that would last only for 15 days. It was then we decided that we should do something. Thus was born Siruthuli,” she explained. 
“There use to be no trace of water even after heavy rains during monsoon season. The entire water would just disappear within no time,” Rajendran added. 
It was at that time, Siruthuli members visited all the areas and found how the water crossed over the seven check dams that were already constructed and entered a pool at Karadimadai village. 
“We decided to construct a pool near every check dam and did that too. As a result, water is being stored and farmers face no water shortage and are able to sustain even during hard times,” 
Vanitha Mohan said and added that the Chairman of Roots Group of Companies, K. Ramasamy, contributed Rs. 30 lakhs for the project. “The company employees too contributed for the project,” she said. ALSO READ
