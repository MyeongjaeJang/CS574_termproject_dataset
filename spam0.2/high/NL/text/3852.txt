In particular, many owners began to complain about the poor performance of the touch screen – it literally ceases to respond to touch at certain points. In other words, in the flagship Samsung Galaxy S9 worth 60,000 rubles or over $ 1000 began to show the dead zones in the screen, and different instances of these zones are chaotic. Importantly, a similar problem affected S9+, which is altogether 67 000, almost as Note 8 six months ago. Sometimes the problem can be solved by rolling back to factory settings, but the majority still have to carry their cell phones in service. Samsung is aware of the situation and currently working to resolve. See also: Nokia will show its second smartphone in a month 
While it is unknown what is the problem or the firmware in the touchscreen, but soon this mystery will be solved. Recall that two years ago, Samsung is faced with a massive marriage of their smartphones – Note 7 around the world started to explode due to defective battery, which resulted in a quick cessation of production of this model and billions of dollars in losses. I hope the problem with the screen in the Samsung Galaxy S9 will not be so massive.
