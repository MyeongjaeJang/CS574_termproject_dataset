Comcast Cable product chief resigns   08:58 CET | News 
Comcast Cable’s chief product officer Chris Satchell is leaving the company and will not be replaced, reports Multichannel. He is moving back to the West Coast, where he’ll be closer to his family and take a new executive role in the health and nutrition industry. 
Satchell, a former Nike and Microsoft executive, joined Comcast in the newly created chief product officer role in 2015, where he headed up the team developing Comcast’s consumer products. This included heavy involvement with new products such as xFi, Comcast’s whole-home Wi-Fi management platform, and its mobile app and set-top experience for the Winter Games in PyeongChang, the report said. 
Comcast has no immediate plans to replace the chief product officer role. However, it promoted two managers to take the lead on Comcast's product vision, Matt Zelesko and Fraser Stirling. Zelesko is now SVP, entertainment products and chief software officer, and Stirling was promoted to SVP, digital home devices.
