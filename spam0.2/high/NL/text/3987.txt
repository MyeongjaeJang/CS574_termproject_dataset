I wish I would have found this book when I was starting my first year of teaching, says one Amazon customer. 
Underprivileged students not only have to deal with their studies but their tough upbringings as well. Author and retired teacher Judy Fitch knows their struggles all too well as she guided them under her wing. Her memoir, Wildflowers , recounts her experiences with such students. From talent shows to courtroom appearances, Fitch recalls the memories she had with her students, whom she fondly calls as wildflowers. Being a teacher, she could not help but grow attached to them. Having understood their backgrounds and empathized with their challenges, she gave them the love and support they needed because she believed that just like other kids, they too were born sweet and innocent. Fitch wrote her book out of her desire to share her experiences to veteran and aspiring teachers. She hopes this will encourage them to impart positive change into their students lives. I wish I would have found this book when I was starting my first year of teaching, says one Amazon customer. Those who wish to get a copy of Wildflowers can purchase it at selected online bookstores.
