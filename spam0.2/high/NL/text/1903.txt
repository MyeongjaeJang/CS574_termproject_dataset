Robot used to remove burner in gas-fired power plant March 21, 2018 by Anna 
Removing a burner from inside a gas turbine is a tricky task. Siemens decided to use a Kawasaki robot to perform this maintenance operation, which heralds the way for reduced outage times for power plant operators. 
This Kawasaki MG10HL robot, installed at the Siemens Lausward power plant in Dusseldorf, has a payload capacity of up to 1,000 kg and a 4-metre reach. The powerful, extra large payload Kawasaki robot was installed to perform the dangerous, routine maintenance task of replacing burners and transitions on huge gas turbines.
