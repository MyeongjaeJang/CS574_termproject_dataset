Wire Service Construction Project Causes Indoor Air Quality Complaints at Nearby Courthouse EMSL Analytical, Inc. provides testing services and monitoring instrumentation to identify diesel exhaust, particulate matter and other airborne pollutants. Wallingford, CT – WEBWIRE – Tuesday, March 20, 2018 
Recently, the New Haven Independent published a report about employee complaints caused by exposure to construction fumes inside a county courthouse in Connecticut. According to the article, nearby construction in the congested urban area were causing health concerns for courthouse workers due to diesel exhaust infiltrating the building. 
Complaints of headaches, nausea and red eye were reported and a grievance was filed with the workers union. This reportedly resulted in an inspection by representatives from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and steps, such as the closure of ground-level fresh air intakes, were implemented to try and reduce the level of fumes entering the courthouse. 
Exposure issues associated with the use of diesel engines in crowded urban construction sites is an all too common occurrence. Diesel exhaust contains a mixture of gases and very small particles that can create a health hazard if not properly controlled. Diesel particulate matter (DPM) includes soot particles made up primarily of carbon, ash, metallic abrasion particles, sulfates and silicates. Diesel soot particles have a solid core consisting of elemental carbon, with other substances attached to the surface, including organic carbon compounds known as aromatic hydrocarbons. 
It is well documented that even short-term exposure to high concentrations of diesel particulate matter and diesel exhaust can cause headaches, dizziness and irritation of the eye, nose and throat that can be severe enough to distract or disable workers, said Joe Frasca, Senior Vice President of Marketing at EMSL Analytical, Inc. In addition to carbon monoxide exposure hazards, prolonged exposure to diesel exhaust can increase the risk of developing cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary and respiratory diseases in addition to lung cancer.
