Zain Kuwait inaugurates new shop at Avenues Mall, including self-service machine Monday 26 March 2018 | 11:24 CET | News 
Zain Kuwait has announced the inauguration of a new retail branch in Phase 4 of the Avenues Mall in Kuwait City. It has more employees to serve mall visitors all week long, especially at weekends. Zain is continuing the expansion of its branch network with a total of 79 outlets nationwide. 
Zain’s new shop uses the concept of the Smart Branch and operates a self-service machine with features previously not available through a self-service machine. It works automatically without the presence of an employee. The machine uses facial recognition, scanning the customer's civil ID and matching their photo. 
The machine provides SIM card replacement. Customers can order a replacement for their lost or ineffective SIM cards and receive a new one immediately without the need of visiting a traditional branch. Other services include recharging lines, bill payment, managing accounts, and purchasing devices from Zain’s Online Store. 
The new branch has a dedicated section for Zain Life's innovative home security services, which include a smart camera, motion sensor, door/window sensors, and smart smoke detector. The branch features Zain's latest solutions for digital entertainment through the PlayStation VR device for virtual reality gaming. Free Headlines in your E-mail
