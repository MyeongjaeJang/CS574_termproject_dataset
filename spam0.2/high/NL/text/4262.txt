Image: Body: The 5th International Congress on Invertebrate Morphology (ICIM5), expected to attract more than 500 international participants, will take place at the University of Vienna in 2020. 
In the first week of August 2020, hundreds of leading experts concerned with the study of invertebrates such as mollusks, insects, and crustaceans will get together at the University of Vienna. Participants will present and discuss their latest findings from a range of disciplines relating to the morphology of invertebrates. Special topics of the congress include aspects of evolutionary and developmental biology, phylogenetics, genomics, and functional morphology. 
Invertebrates account for more than 95 percent of all animal species on our planet. The overarching theme of the 5th International Congress on Invertebrate Morphology (ICIM), hosted by the International Society for Invertebrate Morphology, is the evolution of the exceptional diversity of forms and structures found in invertebrate animals. In 2020 Vienna will follow its predecessors Moscow (2017), Berlin (2013), Harvard (2010), and Copenhagen (2007) as conference host. 
The congress is hosted by the University of Vienna, which is represented by the Department of Integrative Zoology (Faculty of Life Sciences) headed by Andreas Wanninger. Vienna is one of the leading international centers of animal evolution with a tradition that spans more than 150 years of cutting-edge research into invertebrate morphology.
