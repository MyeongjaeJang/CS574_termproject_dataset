Modi government, on Thursday, decided to remove the cap of Rs 10,000 per month imposed by it in July last year on educational assistance given to children of martyrs or those disabled in action, officials said. 
The Union Finance Ministry has sent a notice lifting the Rs 10,000 limit, an NDTV report said. Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman requested the finance ministry to remove the cap. 
“Educational concession will continue without the cap of Rs 10,000 per month,” the notification said. “The ‘Educational Concession’ will be admissible only for undertaking studies in a government/government-aided schools. Military/Sainik schools and others schools and colleges recognised by the central or state government, including the autonomous organisations financed entirely by the central/state governments,” the notification added. 
CONCESSION TO STUDENTS IN AUTONOMOUS INSTITUTES 
The concession will also be applicable to students studying in autonomous institutes financed by central or state governments. Under the scheme, which was initially rolled out in 1972, tuition fee for children of martyrs or those disabled in action were completely waived in schools, colleges and other professional educational institutions. 
The Chiefs of Staff Committee (CoSC), comprising the Army, Navy and the Air Force chiefs, had also written to the defence ministry requesting it to remove the cap, officials told PTI. 
NUMBER OF AFFECTED STUDENTS 
Approximately 250 students were affected during the current financial year following the government’s decision to cap the assistance, according to officials. 
Replying to a question in the Rajya Sabha in January, Minister of State for Defence Subhash Bhamre said that the annual saving on account of putting the cap would be Rs 3.20 crore per annum. 
He said the highest amount drawn has been reported to be Rs 18.95 lakh per annum per student. ALSO READ
