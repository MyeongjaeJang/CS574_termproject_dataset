Build update: Turquoise’s 74m Valicelli project on schedule for 2019 launch 20 March 2018 10:10 Written by Charl van Rooy 
Taking shape at the Turquoise shipyard in Turkey is one of the shipyard’s largest projects to date. By the end of August this year, we can expect to see both the hull and superstructure of the 74-metre project NB 66 come together after which outfitting will commence having the yacht lowered in the waters outside Istanbul next year.

The project was restyled by the hand of A. Vallicelli & C. Yacht Design at the end of last year to feature a contemporary profile with a new stylish Ken Freivokh interior to match. “The interior design focus is on classical elegance,” says Ken Freivokh. “The idea is to achieve a layout that has complete integration between the decks and key internal spaces with everything designed to maximise the continuity of the yacht’s lines as well as long sightlines."

The interior is designed to be bright and airy, focusing on a simple and relaxed lifestyle surrounded by a balanced environment of luxury and functionality wherever you go. There is accommodation space for 12 guests in six cabins which includes a 100 square metre master suite forward on the upper deck. Photo: Turquoise Yachts 
A unique feature of the project will be the full beam beach club that spans the entire 14.2-metre width of the yacht with an extended fold-down platform on either side that further increases the living area. A fixed aft swim platform offers a secure boarding area where guests can get on board the 10.4-metre tender which is launched through a large shell door placed amidships on the starboard side.
