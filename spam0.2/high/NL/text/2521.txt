Samsung reduces carbon emissions by 9.4 tons with 'Share the light' campaign Thursday 22 March 2018 | 11:48 CET | News Samsung has announced that it turned off the lights at its offices around the globe as part of its ‘Share the Light’ campaign, Yonhap news agency reports. According to Samsung, its 1-hour campaign, carried out on 21 March, helped reduce carbon emission by 9.4 tons, which equals to emissions generated by a passenger plane flying 16 trips between South Korea and Guam. Samsung plans to use the cost saved from turning off its lights to donate 1,000 solar-powered LED lamps to areas in the Philippines affected by power shortages. 
"The Samsung 'Share the Light' campaign focuses on raising awareness on environmental issues, as well as sharing hope", said Shim Soon-sun, SVP of Samsung’s Global Customer Satisfaction Center. "We will continue this lights-out project as part of our wider environmental and citizenship initiatives around the world", he added. Free Headlines in your E-mail
