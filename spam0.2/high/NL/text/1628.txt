In January, Questlove was accused of pressuring TV bosses to fire two Tonight Show employees. Kurt Decker and Michael Cimino, two former Tonight Show camera operators, alleged that Questlove – whose group is the house band for the Jimmy Fallon-hosted show – “demanded” the network fire them after they received a racist text message from an NBC stagehand during a taping of the show. 
Decker and Cimino, who are white, claimed that the text message, which was also allegedly sent to The Roots’ Mark Kelley, was unsolicited and that they reported the text to NBC executives. The pair were first suspended and subsequently fired.

We have strong policies in place that protect against discrimination in any form. The decision about these plaintiffs was the company’s alone.”
