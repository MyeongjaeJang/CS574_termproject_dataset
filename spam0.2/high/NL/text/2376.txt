Peru's Bitel aiming for 18% of local market this year   11:41 CET | News 
Peruvian mobile operator Bitel is set to invest a total of USD 100 million in 2018 to expand its network coverage to a further 5,000 localities and expand its presence to 18 percent of the local market, the company’s deputy general manager Raul Galdo told local daily El Comercio. The subsidiary of Vietnamese state-run telco Viettel had 13.5 percent of the Peruvian market at the end of 2017, having launched operations in mid-2014. It has since invested some USD 800 million, installed 25,000 km of fibre-optic cable and expanded its 4G network to 16,500 localities, more than any other mobile operator. Bitel ended 2017 as the country’s fourth largest mobile operator with around 5.3 million customers, behind Movistar, Claro and Entel.
