Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has apologised to the public for the recent Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Facebook has released full-page ads in six British and three American newspapers apologising for the data breach. 
The ad is in the form of a letter by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The ad attempts to clarify the situation, stressing on the fact that Facebook has already stopped apps from “getting so much information” and that data apps receive when a user signs in to Facebook is also being limited. 
“We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can’t, we don’t deserve it,” the ad reads. 
The ad further apologises for the “breach of trust” and the failure of the company to take appropriate steps. 
“This was a breach of trust, and I’m sorry we didn’t do more at the time. We’re now taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” the ad said. 
The ad also states that Facebook will be reminding users of which apps have they given access to of their data so that users can shut off the ones they don’t want anymore. 
Carrying Mark Zuckerberg’s signature at the end, the ad was carried in the Sunday edition of The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal in the US and The Observer, The Sunday Times, Mail on Sunday, Sunday Mirror, Sunday Express and Sunday Telegraph in the UK. ALSO READ
