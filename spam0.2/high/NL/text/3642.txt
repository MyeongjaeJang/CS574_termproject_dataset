0 #SugeKnight’s legal defense team is OVER IT #Roommates. According to @PageSix, Suge’s ongoing murder case has hit yet another set back after his not 1, not 2 but 15th lawyer has decided to resign. If you’ve been keeping up with this case, the entire trial has been plagued with witness tampering allegations, illegal phone calls, Suge Knight’s health issues and even death threats for lawyers, jurors and Suge Knight himself! Suge is pleading not guilty for attempted murder for allegedly running over two men in Compton, CA. As of now there is a 3-year wait for his trial to begin but that will be even longer now!
