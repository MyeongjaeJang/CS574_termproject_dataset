Share on: google + After producing a home shirt with the football culture collective a couple years back, Umbro have paired up with Guerilla FC again, to create an alternative, pink away strip. With a tone-on-tone, hot pink leaf pattern on this shirt, it’s certainly one to stand out, with plenty more pink involved in this colourful and vibrant football fashion jersey. However, it’s the more subtle touches that are to be admired the most, here, with hash marks of the left sleeve acting as a tribute to an Italian philosopher. Antonio Gramsci, one of the most important Marxist thinkers of the 20th century, is the man honoured on this shirt. An opposition to a fascist Italian government during his lifetime, he was imprisoned for his beliefs as a plot to squash his voice, but inside he wrote of ways to change the world for the better. His determination has been paid tribute to here by Guerrilla FC, who, with the Russia World Cup approaching, have also written ‘Guerrilla’ in a Cyrillic font on the back of this shirt. With hints at political activism, this is a fitting shirt considering the name of this US-based streetwear brand and this poignant pink jersey will drop on Wednesday 21st March at their store.
