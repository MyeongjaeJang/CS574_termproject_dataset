Linux Foundation joins with OCP to further develop SDN, NFV open source networking   13:37 CET | News 
The Linux Foundation and the Open Compute Project (OCP) will work together to further develop software- and hardware-based open source networking. The organisations want to create stronger integration and testing, new open networking features, more scalability, a reduction in capex/opex, greater harmonisation with switch network operating systems, and increased interoperability for network functions virtualization (NFV) network transformation. 
OCP will provide an open source option for the hardware layer, and the Linux Foundation's OPNFV project will integrate OCP along with other open source software projects into relevant NFV reference architectures. 
The two organisation have already cooperated on activities such as plugfests and joint demos. The two see this expansion as a way of removing the roadblocks to the adoption of NFV and the transformation of telecom infrastructure. OCP, LF Networking projects, and other ecosystem partners will be onsite at ONS North America, taking place at Los Angeles on 26-29 March.
