Written by DTVE Reporter 4 hours ago HTC has started taking global pre-orders for its new Vive Pro virtual reality headset and has dropped the price of its original Vive kit by US$100. The Vive Pro is priced at US$799 for the headset only and will start shipping on April 5. The current generation Vive will now cost US$499 for the full kit – which includes the headset, two wireless controllers and two base stations. “With the Vive Pro we are delivering the best quality display and visual experience to the most discerning VR enthusiasts,” said Daniel O’Brien , HTC Vive general manager, US. “Our goal has always been to offer the most premium VR platform available and to drive adoption for VR. By lowering the price of the current Vive, we are making VR more accessible while expanding the potential market for developers. “Whether you’re a VR enthusiast or new to the platform, there’s never been a better time to join the most complete VR platform available.” HTC first unveiled the Vive Pro at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas in January.
