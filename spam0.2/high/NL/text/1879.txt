UK Autodrive tests self-driving pods in Milton Keynes   15:04 CET | News 
The UK Autodrive project has officially started trials in Milton Keynes, with up to 40 self-driving pods being tested in the city over the next 12 months. UK Autodrive is a 3-year project, funded by Innovate UK, to trial the use of connected and self-driving vehicles on the streets of Milton Keynes and Coventry. 
The city council is working with Aurrigo, RDM Group's autonomous vehicle division, to test a new first/last-mile transport solution for local residents, visitors and shoppers. Up to 40 pods will operate in the city centre from Central Station to Campbell Park and Silbury Boulevard to Avebury Boulevard. These pods can travel up to 15 mph and last up to 60 miles on one charge. Aurrigo has invested to set up a control centre in the city centre and has recruited the first three of a 10-strong team to support the trials.
