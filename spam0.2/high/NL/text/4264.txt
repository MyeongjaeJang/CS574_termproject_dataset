DE-CIX adds two new support features for route servers   13:44 CET | News 
Global internet exchange operator DE-CIX said its route servers now support two more features, operational BGP communications for session shutdown (RFC 8326) and Informational BGP Communities for origin tagging. With RFC 8326, users can now instruct route servers to calculate and redistribute alternate paths for advertised prefixes before commencing maintenance, enabling routers of other customers to converge and preventing "micro black holing", said DE-CIX. DE-CIX route servers can also tag all prefixes with certain BGP Communities, indicating their origin and enabling users to determine where certain prefixes have been entered into the DE-CIX switching platform, said DE-CIX.
