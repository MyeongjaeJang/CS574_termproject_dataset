Avanti Gateway Earth Station goes live in Main One's MDXI data centre   11:07 CET | News 
MainOne's MDXI data centre has partnered with Avanti Communications Group to host and manage the satellite operatorâ€™s Gateway Earth Station (GES) in Nigeria. The partnership has already delivered Avanti's first GES in West Africa, hosted at MDXI's satellite farm in Lagos. Avanti has invested up to USD 20 million in the Nigerian Gateway and this will ensure data from the HYLAS 4 Ka-band satellite is delivered efficiently in Nigeria and interconnected with other networks. 
The HYLAS 4 Ka-band satellite will deliver High Throughput Satellite (HTS) connectivity to complement existing Nigerian fibre-optic networks, ensuring access is available to fast internet even in remote and rural locations. Applications that will be supported by Avanti's third Ka-band satellite include broadband for homes and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), rural schools, large enterprises, government agencies, and cellular backhaul for 2G, 3G and 4G mobile networks. 
Avanti's efforts in Nigeria will include the deployment of its Every Community Online (ECO) initiative, with built-in Wi-Fi hotpots in schools, communities and government agencies, especially in under-served and remote parts of the country where power availability and connectivity services remain a challenge. 
Avanti will take advantage of Main One's extensive coverage to expand its market reach in nine countries in West Africa. MDXI has been chosen to launch this project in West Africa based on its capability to deliver mission-critical data centre services and provide extensive interconnection with other operators, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and the Nigerian Internet Exchange.
