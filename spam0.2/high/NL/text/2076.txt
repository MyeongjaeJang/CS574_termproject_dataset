Home / policy / Boris Johnson: the Position of Moscow in the case of Skripal is becoming more and more strange Boris Johnson: the Position of Moscow in the case of Skripal is becoming more and more strange 10   
The UK has learned lessons from the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko and Sergei Skripal, London will put pressure on Russia. This in an exclusive interview with DW said British foreign Minister, Boris Johnson. 
Experts from the Organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons (OPCW) on Monday, March 19, arrived in the UK. They should examine the nerve substance, which on 4 March was poisoned by an agent of the British and Russian secret service, Sergei Skripal and his daughter Julia. In Brussels on the same day, met the foreign Ministers of the European Union, condemned the attack using chemical weapons and expressed “unlimited solidarity” with London in connection with the case Skripal. Arriving at the meeting British foreign Minister, Boris Johnson gave an interview to Jeanne Nemcova. 
DW: Thank you, I found the opportunity to come to us for an interview. 
Boris Johnson: Not at all. You are the daughter of Boris Nemtsov? 
Yes. 
– I came to the place where they killed your father. 
– I know, thank you very much for that. It was very important for our memorial too. It’s several times destroyed. It was a signal for the authorities to leave him alone. 
I’m glad we did it. Actually, I’m a Russophile in life, but it seems to me that the country is going in the wrong direction. What do I call you? 
– Jeanne Nemtsov or miss. And you have the same name as my father, Boris. 
– Yes, Boris. 
– Shall we start? Mr. Johnson, thank you very much and welcome to the program. A few days ago you stated with the utmost probability it can be argued that Vladimir Putin personally instructed to poison double agent Sergei Skripal. What are the British government and Parliament have the evidence for this assertion? 
– I think it’s very important, first, to show that the culprits are not residents of Russia, nor Russia. We have no quarrel with Russia. You know, I love Russia, I have ancestors from that country. Not the case, and in the Kremlin and in the Russian state in the state in which it is present. That’s the reason I made that statement. If you look at the substance that was used, it is poison “Newbie”– such conclusion was made by our experts from the laboratory of “Porton Down”, they are good professionals. We invited the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons (OPCW) will arrive today to review samples of nerve agents. 
You also have to consider that Sergey Skripal, the man they tried to destroy, was identified as the target of the attack. Vladimir Putin himself said that traitors, such as Skripal, it is necessary to poison. So that’s a paralytic agent, which was done only in Russia… 
Yeah, but do you have evidence that Putin has instructed? Because no one has ever so directly blamed the Russian leader. 
– Right. But I’m afraid that he’s responsible for the “noisy train” as we say in the UK (“Who is responsible for noisy train”– the beginning of the poem Edwin Milliken. – Ed.). Someone needs to answer, to be responsible, and we in the UK think that pieces of evidence point to the Russian government, as in the case of Alexander Litvinenko. And if you remember traces of polonium is very clearly brought to Russia. In the end, the responsibility for the activities of the Russian state was under Vladimir Putin, so I guess he can’t get away from it and distance themselves. 
– Why you made that statement without waiting for the results of the investigation? I mean not only you and the British government. 
– We provide samples of the OPCW experts, who will arrive today. By the way, I totally trust them and the results of their work. They will analyze them in the best laboratories. I will explain to you the reason why I want to continue to develop this business. We have a very bad experience with Russia, how the Russian state under Putin is behaving when problems arise like this. 12 years ago in London there was an attempt at Alexander Litvinenko. Then it was an extraordinary event. Used polonium. The UK has progressed very slowly and with extreme delicacy in the investigation. We decided to cooperate with the Russian justice system to try to extradite Mr Lugovoi and Mr Kovtun, the main suspects in the poisoning.

But in the end we got a mocking sarcastic refusal to participate in our judicial process. Now we found that it is very important to make the decision and to show that if you are going irresponsible to use a paralytic agent of a type not used in Europe since the end of world war II, and doing it in Salisbury in Wiltshire, it would face diplomatic consequences. That’s why we started… 
– Mr. Johnson, you claim that the source of this substance, “Beginner”, was Russia. As you managed so quickly to establish it? The UK has samples of this stuff? 
We conducted an investigation as quickly as we could. Let me tell you with all clarity. When almost two years ago I became foreign Minister, one of my goals was to lend Russia a hand. And I really did it when went to visit Sergei Lavrov in Moscow against the advice of some people who, by the way, told me that it is completely useless. But I wanted to try it, because, you know, I sincerely think that Russia is an incredible country, fantastic place, and it pains me to see what kind of relationship exists between us. So I was really disappointed that happened. But when I looked at the evidence, I mean the experts of the laboratory “Porton Down”…. 
– So, they have samples? 
Yes. And their conclusions were quite categorical. I asked responsible: are you sure? And he replied that no doubt. We have very few alternatives, except for those actions that we have taken. But I have to say that the difference between the current time and what happened 12 years ago with Alexander Litvinenko, is that we get a lot more signs of solidarity from the international community, much more of an understanding of behavior that has characterized Russia in recent years. Here, during conversations at the table with the leaders of other European countries in Brussels not found virtually anyone, directly or indirectly, have not encountered such hostile behavior or subversive activity. 
Yeah, but in an interview you gave on Sunday, you noticed that you wanted constructive cooperation with Russia in the case Skripal. How do you imagine that after you directly accused Putin? 
– Right, yeah, you know, as was stated by our Prime Minister, like, a week ago, Monday: we give them a choice. We said this is a “Beginner”. If there is a rational explanation of how this substance could disappear from your inventory, how it could be used on the streets of Salisbury, then let us work together, let us find out the truth. But if, on the other hand, there is no explanation, we can only conclude that it is the actions of the Russian state. The response we have received. We just watched a lot of satirical tweets and trolling. 
– Yes, but the Kremlin says that they would like to access the case materials. You will give the opportunity to Russian investigators? 
– I think that at the first stage we will entrust the investigation to the technical experts of the OPCW, who arrive today in the UK. Let’s see what conclusions they make. It was adopted in such cases the procedure that we must follow according to the Convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons. 
You know, I have to say that I think the Russian position on the fate of the “Newbie” all the more strange. In one statement we say that has never produced a “Newbie”, – said the Russian Ambassador to the EU. In another statement claimed that they have produced it, but all stocks were destroyed. In the third statement says: Yes, all stocks destroyed, except a certain number that could come in countries such as Sweden, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, USA, and maybe UK. It seems that the Russian Ambassador to the EU said that the reserves “Newbie” was in the UK. I think they need to determine this. Of course, if Putin’s regime will be able to clarify or explain what happened, we’re all ears, waiting to listen. 
Denied if the British government of the Russian diplomats access to Yulia Skripal, who is a citizen of Russia? If so, what were the reasons for this decision? 
– I’m not sure I have to defend our decision. Let me just say that all of the collected data indicates that the agents of the Russian state tried to kill Yulia Skripal, and her father. So I think our challenge now is to protect them as much as possible. See also: The Catalan dream of Moscow 
– The British government and the Prime Minister announced a number of measures. You sent 23 Russian diplomats. You got a symmetrical response. What steps are you going to take? What are the goals? I understand that a number of measures will be non-public. 
Ms. Nemtsova, you have to understand, we don’t want to do this, we do not deliver any pleasure. 
– I’m not talking about pleasure. I’m asking you about the measures you intend to take. 
We expelled the 23 diplomats – it was probably the spies under diplomatic cover. There are a number of other actions that we perform, in particular, will strengthen control of our borders. We have lots of laws that allow us strictly to do with the money that was received… 
–…money of unknown origin. 
–…Yes, to claim to explain the origin of welfare. We are talking about money obtained illegally or through corruption. All that we can do. We have a National Agency in criminal cases. They can and will take the job. But I must stress that the UK is a country with rule of law, and I can’t do as a politician to say: here take the money of this person, do that, do it. We do not have all works. 
– You are going to develop a list, similar to what appeared in the US – the so-called “Kremlin report”? 
We share intelligence, we share information, we share lists of people with friends and partners around the world, but we operate on the principle of the rule of law. It is the task of agencies to investigate criminal cases, to determine whether to pursue a case. 
– But, Mr. Johnson, you can tell right now that all officials who work together with Putin, including Igor Shuvalov, who enjoys a luxurious property in London that he and people like him, will be deprived of this property? 
– I think the worst thing I could do given the work that is carried out, is to call individual names, or specify individual cases, because these individuals, as you know, tight wallets and very influential lawyers. And I think almost everything I say about anybody else, will be perceived as prejudicial. 
– I otherwise formulate your question. You mentioned that some businessmen associated with Putin, may be punished. What criteria will be used to determine who is connected and who is not connected with Putin? 
– I repeat, but I think you ask me and that is absolutely correct, you delve into the details of these cases. From my side it would be right to do so. All legal decisions are open and can be challenged through our judicial system, and this is very important, because should not be, political preference, or intervention policy. And they will not. 
– You said you felt strong support from the European Union and the United States. Do you think the West can go to drastic measures, for example, to try to exclude Russia from the UN Security Council or to impose new sanctions? Why are you laughing? 
Well, because of changes in the composition of the UN security Council required a unanimous decision of the UN security Council, and I do not think that Russia will vote for it. But we were very shocked, surprised and felt encouraged from the support to the UK and the high level of solidarity with us. What we want is to work with our friends and partners to share intelligence, strengthen our defenses against disinformation and cyber attacks, and to prosecute people who illegally made a fortune – that is what will be our work. 
But the goal, I have to emphasize this point, the goal is absolutely not to punish the population of Russia. Our goal is to try to show that we care about deeply destructive, dangerous, irresponsible, with no regard for human lives, the behavior that we see from Russia and we want to put pressure on this regime so that he was looking for new ways. And such way you can find. And there is hope. But there is no hope if we just allow such things to happen.
