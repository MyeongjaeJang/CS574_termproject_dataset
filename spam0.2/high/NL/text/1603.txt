Which wine do I recommend? Here are three you might wish to try — Reva K Singh Castello di Nipozzano Riserva 2014. 
Italian wine producer Frescobaldi is celebrating the 150th anniversary of Castello di Nipozzano, Frescobaldi’s oldest estate with the release of a limited edition of the iconic Castello di Nipozzano Riserva 2014. The first vintage of Nipozzano Riserva dates back to 1864. A bottle of that vintage is still stored in the Private Collection of the Frescobaldi family. Retailing for Rs 3,500 a bottle, the wine is available at La Cave Wines and Spirits. Il Poggione’s Rosso di Montalcino 2015 
Another fine wine from Wine Park’s portfolio, Château de Saint Cosme, Gigondas 2015 , also figures in Wine Spectator’s top 100. A far cry from light, fruity, forgettable Côtes du Rhônes, Saint-Cosme is a rich but refined and multi-layered red from Louis Barruol ‘s Gigondas estate. Louis Barruol is the 14th generation of his family to look after Saint- Cosme, which the family have owned since 1570. The wine costs Rs 7,663 in Mumbai and Rs 7,280 in Delhi respectively. 
A standard bearer of the region’s wines, Il Poggione’s Rosso di Montalcino 2015, shows the typicity of Sangiovese without being disguised by oak or heavy extraction. An entry level wine of great subtlety and aromatic character from a traditional house, this Rosso showing the forest, earthy side of Sangiovese, is a stylish wine of real finesse that would pair beautifully with a mushroom pasta or risotto. Available in Mumbai from The Wine Park for Rs 3,998 , the wine features in Wine Spectator’s 100 top wines of 2017.
