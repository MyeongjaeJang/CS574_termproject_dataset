BASF Canada reduces its carbon footprint with Bullfrog Powers green electricity MISSISSAUGA, ON and TORONTO, ON – WEBWIRE – Monday, March 19, 2018 
BASF and Bullfrog Power, Canadas leading green energy provider, have formed a new environmental partnership that will see BASF chose green electricity for its Canadian corporate headquarters, as well its production facilities in Windsor, Cornwall and Etobicoke (ON), Blackie and Nisku (AB), Saint Leonard (QC), and Saskatoon (SK). 
BASFs renewable energy commitment will reduce its CO 2 emissions footprint by approximately 1,520 tonnes on an annual basis. This amount of carbon dioxide is equivalent to taking nearly 325 cars off the road for a year. 
Through the partnership with Bullfrog Power, BASF is reducing its environmental impact and supporting an innovative approach to growing Canadas renewable energy industry, said Marcelo Lu, President of BASF Canada. BASF wants to contribute to a world that provides a viable future with enhanced quality of life for everyone. Partnering with Bullfrog Power means BASF is helping to support community renewable energy projects across Canada. 
The agreement with Bullfrog Power ensures that 100 percent renewable electricity is put onto the grid to match the amount of conventional electricity being used at BASFs Canadian corporate headquarters and its bullfrogpowered production facilities. Across Canada, Bullfrogs green electricity comes from a blend of wind and low-impact hydro power sourced from new Canadian renewable energy facilities. 
BASFs partnership signifies that manufacturers in the supply chain increasingly see energy as a key input when making their products more sustainable, said Ron Seftel, CEO, Bullfrog Power. As a global leader and major chemistry company in Canada, BASF is taking a proactive approach to addressing climate change by proactively committing to renewable electricity at its Canadian sites. 
By means of the green energy commitments of bullfrogpowered homes and businesses across Canada, including BASF, Bullfrog Power is able to provide critical financing to support the development of new, community-based green energy projects from coast to coast. 
Bullfrog Power has supported more than 130 community projects across Canada, including:
