The yacht was built under the project name Rainbow and features a Terence Disdale interior that accommodates up to 14 guests and 27 crew members. She is powered by twin 3400 HP ABB diesel-electric engines, which power her twin azipods. Here she is seen departing the colourful port entrance of Willemstad on the island of Curaçoa.
