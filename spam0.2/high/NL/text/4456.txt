Navingo’s Siwart Mackintosh has sent us an image of the 156.7 meters long construction support vessel Normand Vision at Damen Shiprepair Schiedam, The Netherlands. 
A spokesperson for Ocean Installer told Offshore Energy Today the 2014-built Normand Vision recently completed its work on the Cambo field west of Shetland for Siccar Point. 
Ocean Installer had been awarded a contract with Siccar Point to support the appraisal and early production phases of the Cambo Project off the UK back in November 2017 . The project entailed the use of both the Normand Vision and the Normand Reach vessels. 
The field is located northwest of the Shetland Islands in the UK at a water depth of 1,100m, one of the deepest fields in Northern Europe yet to be developed. Over 100 million barrels of recoverable resources have already been discovered. 
Also, Normand Vision is expected to be deployed in the Barents Sea in 2019, as Ocean Installer has recently been awarded a contract to by Statoil for marine operations in the Askeladd field development. 
Ocean Installer will be involved with Askeladd throughout the entire development phase, until the field is hooked up to Snøhvit in 2020, with offshore operations planned for the summer seasons of 2019 and 2020. 
The Ocean Installer spokesperson could not provide any comment on Normand Vision’s regarding near-term future projects or the reasons why the vessel is currently in the Netherlands. Share this article
