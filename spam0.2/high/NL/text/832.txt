The Dutch football association KNVB has decided to use video referees in all next season’s Eredivisie matches plus a string of other competition games. 
The 16 Eredivisie clubs voted in favour of the move at the association’s AGM on Monday evening. The organisation said in a statement the decision is a ‘unique moment in Dutch football history’. 
From next year referees will be able to ask a video assistant referee ( VAR ) for advice before making a decision. The video referee will analyse the situation on the basis of different camera angles and make recommendations. 
The KNVB tested the use of video referees in cup matches and the play-offs for promotion last year. In December, clubs agreed to discuss the cost of introducing the new system. 
From August, referees will be able to refer to video referees during all Eredivisie matches, the four final play-offs for promotion and relegation to the premier league, play-offs for European football, the Johan Cruijff plate title fight and the quarter finals of the KNVB Cup, the KNVB said. 
In total, 324 games will involve the use of the VAR system. 
Earlier this month, Fifa voted to revise the rules governing football to include the use of video assistant referees, clearing the way for the Dutch move. Features
