Mellanox Ethernet selected for Israeli bourse infrastructure upgrade Tuesday 20 March 2018 | 12:36 CET | News 
Mellanox Technologies has announced that its Ethernet systems, including Spectrum switches, ConnectX-5 network cards and the LinkX family of cables, were selected by the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) for all of its communication infrastructure, from the commercial network to the enterprise network. Mellanox will supply the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange with Spectrum switches running Cumulus and Mellanox Onyx operating systems, and the Mellanox NEO management system. 
The Spectrum switches support all the network speeds available in the market: 1G, 10G, 25G, 40G, 50G, 100G, all with the lowest latency for these speeds (300ns) and providing equal communication services to all users of the system. Mellanox's ConnectX-5 network cards will give communication access to the stock exchange servers. The use of built-in data acceleration technology in the adapter cards will enable the maximum return on investment for the TASE's data centres. 
The choice by Eli Kars, the communication and hardware infrastructure manager, and the technical staff of the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange in Mellanox's advanced solutions was made primarily on the basis of technological leadership, which enables them to address both the immediate and future needs of the stock exchange. The new infrastructure will enable the TASE to provide local and international capital market operators with advanced services, such as colocation services, similar to international standards.
