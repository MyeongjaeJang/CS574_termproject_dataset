Nigerian telecoms operators complain of high cost of fibre optic leasing  33 CET | News 
The high cost of leasing fibre optic infrastructure is the reason for telecommunications operators to seek ownership of that transmission link, Nigeria CommunicationsWeek reported. Abhulime Ehiagwina, chief financial officer at nTel said at a recent Nigeria Information Technology Reporters Association (NITRA) breakfast meeting that the high cost of leasing fibre optic from owners of the infrastructure does not make economic sense compared with owning the link. 
Ajay Awasthi, CEO of Spectranet, said that it costs more to move bandwidth from Lagos to Ibadan than moving it from London to Lagos. 
Samuel Adeleke, immediate past president of the Internet Services Providers Association of Nigeria (ISPAN), said that licensing spectrum as a way to increase broadband penetration is not enough to achieve the target. Adeleke said the NCC needs to look at the proper use of its licences in future. 
For instance, Globacom has invested in intra-city and inter-city fibre networks that are presently not in use. This infrastructure is required to increase broadband penetration in the country, and the regulator should ensure the effective utilisation of licensed spectrum, said Adeleke.
