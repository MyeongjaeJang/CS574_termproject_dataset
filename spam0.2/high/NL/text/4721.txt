Mweb withdraws claim for router capabilities   10:39 CET | News 
South African ISP Mweb has withdrawn a claim that the Huawei B315 router offers LTE-A capabilities, following an Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa (ASA) complaint, reports Mybroadband. Mweb promoted the router as an LTE-A product as part of its LTE service offering. The Huawei website clearly states the B315 is an LTE router, which supports LTE category four connections of up to 150Mbps. LTE-Advanced is a category six or above version of 4G. 
The complainant told the ASA that the advertising was misleading, as the router purchased does not support LTE-Advanced but only LTE. Instead of admitting its mistake, Mweb said it does not believe its advertising was misleading, but took the decision to "simply use the terms LTE instead of LTE-A going forward". The ASA accepted Mweb's undertaking to withdraw its LTE-A claim, on the condition that the material is not used again.
