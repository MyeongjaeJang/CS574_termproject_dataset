Swiss company eyes acquisition of Megacom   11:31 CET | News 
The Kyrgyzstan State Property Fund announced that it received an application from the Switzerland-based company MFT Services expressing interest in the acquisition of mobile operator Alfa Telecom, working under the Megacom brand, reports Tazabek. The fund is preparing a tender to try and sell the state-owned operator. 
In September 2017, Yelena Nagornaya, a Russian citizen, submitted the only application for the acquisition of Alfa Telecom. She agreed to pay KGS 14.5 billion for the 100 percent stake in the operator, as well as a commission fee totaling 7 percent of the acquisition sum. Nagornaya was not connected to the telecommunications sector. In December 2017 Penwell Business sent a letter to the Kyrgyzstan government asking for compensation of USD 200 million in order to resolve a dispute over the ownership of Megacom outside of court. Penwell Business owned a 51 percent stake in Megacom in 2009-2010 and is controlled by Russian businessmen.
