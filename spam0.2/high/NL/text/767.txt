New Delhi: Actress Sridevi, who passed away in Dubai on February 24, 2018, due to accidental drowning, was pretty excited to be a part of Karan Johar’s ‘Shiddat’. But now, her daughter Janhvi Kapoor has confirmed that Sridevi’s role would be played Madhuri Dixit in Abhishek Varman’s film being produced by Dharma Productions. 
Thanking Madhuri, Janhvi wrote in her Instagram account, “Abhishek Varman’s next film was very close to mom’s heart …Dad, Khushi and I are thankful to Madhuriji for now being a part of this beautiful film…”. She posted a picture of the two actresses from the sets of a dance reality show along with the message. 
The shooting of Karan Johar’s film was being planned and was to go on floors in a month or two. Rumours were rife that after Sridevi’s sudden and untimely death, Karan had decided to shelve the project. 
However, a report dismissed the claim and stated that Madhuri has been approached for the film as she is a good friend of Karan Johar and she feels that it will be an apt way to pay tribute to Sridevi if she becomes a part of this project. 
The film features a stellar ensemble cast of Varun Dhawan, Alia Bhatt, Sanjay Dutt, Sonakshi Sinha and Aditya Roy Kapur. The film will be directed by Abhishek Varman of ‘2 States’ fame and it also marks the fourth collaboration of Varun and Johar after ‘Student of the Year’, ‘Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania’ and ‘Badrinath Ki Dulhania’. 
On the professional front, Varun Dhawan will be next seen in Shoojit Sircar’s ‘October’ and YRF’s ‘Sui Dhaaga’ opposite Anushka Sharma. Both the films are slated to release in 2018. Meanwhile, Alia Bhatt has some interesting films like ‘Raazi’, ‘Brahmastra’ and ‘Gully Boy’ in her kitty. ALSO READ
