Wireless Broadband Alliance launches Wi-Fi deployment guidelines series   15:35 CET | News The Wireless Broadband Alliance (WBA) launched its Wi-Fi Deployment Guidelines and Compliance Checklist that define the best practices for wireless network operators and infrastructure vendors to deploy Wi-Fi networks. The full ‘Guidelines’, available to WBA members will act as a user manual for existing and future Wi-Fi deployments. Available to the general public, the Checklist was created to ensure high-level industry-wide standardised approaches for efficient Wi-Fi network deployment. 
Both the Guidelines and the Checklist cover a set of baseline standards that encompass the lifecycle deployment phases including: 'Planning guidelines,' 'Site survey,' 'Radio spectrum analysis,' 'Wi-Fi network implementation,' and 'Configuration and operation.' These standards form the basis of the Wi-Fi Deployment Guidelines Series that the WBA will extend to key industry verticals and applications throughout 2018. The five focus areas making up the series include 'In-Flight connectivity,' 'Enterprise Wi-Fi,' 'Venue/Stadium Wi-Fi,' 'City Wi-Fi,' and 'Hospitality Wi-Fi.' 
WBA will give an endorsement to operators and infrastructure vendors that plan to deploy or optimise Wi-Fi networks and follow the Guidelines and Checklist. 
In addition to an acknowledgment from the WBA, operators and vendors that comply will benefit from a collaborative industry effort to create a new level of efficiency, performance and reduced time-to-market.
