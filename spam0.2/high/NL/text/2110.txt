Sky releases Gender Pay Gap Report WEBWIRE – Wednesday, March 21, 2018 
We have announced our Gender Pay Gap Report. To find out more please watch our video . 
Stephen van Rooyen, UK CEO, Sky said, Fairness and equality are values that sit at the very heart of our business and we ensure we pay our men and women equally for doing the same role with the same level of experience. However, as with many big organisations, we have more men than women in senior, digital and technology roles and this is what is driving our current gender pay gap. We know that when we achieve gender balance across these areas our gender pay gap will be eliminated. 
Weve already initiated a number of programmes aimed at improving gender representation across our many different teams and whilst were seeing improvements, we know there is more we can do. We have ambitious targets in place - such as aiming for 50:50 gender balance amongst our most senior roles by 2020 - which demonstrates the importance were placing on improving gender balance across all levels of our organisation.

We appreciate there is currently a lot of interest in the topic of gender pay and levels of female representation across the broadcasting industry, with a call for greater transparency. In line with legal requirements, we have disclosed the gender pay gap for Sky UK Ltd  the group that employs all our broadcasting plus corporate teams- along with our other employing entities that make up Sky UK Plc. Youll see that both the mean and median gaps within this employing entity are below our average and when we look at only our employees who work on-screen, these gaps reduce even further.
