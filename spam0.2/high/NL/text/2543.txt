ETHENEA: Federal Reserve raises interest rates as expected   
By Yves Longchamp, Head of Research at ETHENEA Independent Investors S.A. 
As anticipated, the Federal Reserve has raised the target interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, continuing the cycle of monetary tightening that began in December 2015. Accompanying this rate increase was a favourable revision of the economic scenario and the announcement of a somewhat faster increase in interest rates in 2019 and 2020 than previously expected. 
In many ways, the Fed's decision is similar to that of the ECB in early March. Both of these decisions illustrate the new environment in which the central banks are operating. Economic forecasts are revised favourably and asymmetrically. In the wake of good incoming data, growth forecasts are sharply revised upwards, while inflation forecasts, on the other hand, are only slightly adjusted. In this context, the “middle ground” policy of Jerome Powell, the new chairman of the Fed, is a good fit. It represents the art of doing a little, but not too much. 
This middle ground approach is the central banks' response to two opposing developments. On one hand, the economy is sound and the economic outlook is strengthening. As a result, policymakers are increasingly confident that an interest rate rise is necessary. Yet the inability of forecasting models to anticipate inflation shows that even the most sophisticated institutions do not fully understand how an economy works. 
In order to reconcile these two developments, the Fed chose a middle path. This consists of taking a step, checking the results, and adjusting accordingly. In other words, the Fed has a plan but is prepared to adjust it as and when it becomes necessary. Interest rates are set to rise in the coming years but, in due course, future growth and inflation data will re-define the optimal interest rate path.
