Glasvezel buitenaf agrees roll-out plan for northeast Limburg  27 CET | News 
Dutch operator Glasvezel buitenaf has signed a letter of intent with the municipalities Beesel, Bergen, Roerdalen, Roermond and Venlo and the province of Limburg on bringing a fibre network to outlying areas of the northeast of Limburg. Local business groups representing the agricultural sector, employers and SMEs also signed the agreement. 
The agreement with multiple municipalities is expected to make the demand aggregation for the fibre network easier, allowing Glasvezel buitenaf to target several thousand addresses at a time, covering more than one town. The province and municipalities will also help facilitate the roll-out procedures. A timetable for the project has yet to be decided. 
The operator is already working on a roll-out in northwest Limburg. This targets around 5,000 addresses in Weert, Nederweert, Peel en Maas, Leudal and Maasgouw, with a deadline of 11 June to sign up. 
Glasvezel buitenaf, owned by the investor EQT, is active in a total of seven provinces, targeting mainly rural areas. With 23 campaigns, over 70,000 households and businesses could be provided with access to its FTTP network.
