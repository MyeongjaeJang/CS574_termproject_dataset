1, Place du Congrès - 1000 organisatie Centrum voor Europese Beleidsstudies (CEPS) This conference concludes a research project carried out by CEPS aimed at exploring the impact of low-cost carriers in Europe in terms of integration and patterns of mobility. Following the rapid development and expansion of low-cost carriers in Europe in recent decades, we examine their contribution to integration and mobility throughout the EU via various channels, ranging from labour mobility and tourism to regional cohesion. The event will be opened by CEPS CEO Karel Lannoo, followed by welcoming remarks by a representative of Ryanair, which kindly provided funding for the project. The CEPS research team will then present the main findings of their report, which will serve as the focus of debate at the subsequent panel discussion on the role of low-cost carriers in European integration. Moderated by Miroslav Beblavý, CEPS Senior Research Fellow, the panel will feature high-level EU officials, academics and representatives from the major low-cost airlines in Europe (a detailed programme and registration form will be available shortly). Participation in this event is exceptionally free of charge.
