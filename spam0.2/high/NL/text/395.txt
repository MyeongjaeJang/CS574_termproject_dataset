Elliot calls for TIM to sell off network assets and Sparkle unit Monday 19 March 2018 | 08:58 CET | News 
Activist fund Elliot has called for Telecom Italia (TIM) to list or partially sell off its international services arm Sparkle as well as its national fixed access network (Netco) as part of a bid for major change at the operator. In a letter to shareholders published on its website, the fund said a ““truly independent” board is required to improve governance and performance at Telecom Italia. “Poor stewardship under the Vivendi-controlled board has resulted in deeply troubling corporate governance issues, a valuation discount and strategic failures,” said Elliot, adding that it would also urge a new board to convert TIM’s saving shares into ordinary ones and reintroduce dividends last paid in 2012. The fund last week requested the inclusion of a motion to replace six Telecom Italia board members , including its chairman, in the agenda of the shareholder meeting scheduled for 24 April. Elliott said it’s not aiming for control of TIM, but wants to be a catalyst for change. It has so far declared the ownership of over 3 percent of ordinary TIM stock as well as financial instruments that could bring its potential interest to over 5 percent. Free Headlines in your E-mail
