NASK announces tender to connect schools in 6 voivodeships under OSE project Tuesday 20 March 2018 | 11:30 CET | News 
Polish research agency NASK has said it is putting out to tender the contract for data services for nearly 4,700 schools (92 percent) in six voivodeships. In line with the governmental programme, 1,500 schools will be connected to the National Educational Network (OSE) this year. OSE will provide broadband connections for schools at a minimum of 100 Mbps, and a security package. Nationwide, there are 30,500 schools and educational institutions in 19,500 locations. 
Currently, few schools have a sufficient internet connection. Only 10 percent of schools have internet connections with parameters allowing them to use it for education, said Marek Zagorski, State Secretary at the Ministry of Digitisation. Education is mostly done without the application of modern technology, and the implementation of the OSE is intended to change that. 
The governmental research institute NASK is responsible for the implementation of the OSE network and will subsequently maintain it. As well as the internet access, NASK will provide schools with a security package and educational content. 
NASK has announced a tender to provide data connections between the buildings of educational institutions and the OSE network. The tender applies to schools in the following voivodeships: Lubuskie, Wielkopolskie, Lodzkie, Warmian-Masurian, Swietokrzyskie and Podlasie. With 1,500 schools due to be connected this year, and more than 12,000 in 2019, the first tender applies to up to 4,700 locations. In total, by 2020, OSE will connect every school, that is, nearly 19,500 locations. 
The costs of the launch of the new educational network OSE amount to PLN 500 million. The funds will come from the Operational Programme Digital Poland (POPC). The costs of operating the network, including purchases from telecommunications operators to provide free internet for schools, are estimated at PLN 1.3 billion. Thanks to the initiative of the Minister of Education Anna Zalewska, the project has reserved ten-year financing from the state budget of PLN 164 million a year from 2022. 
In addition, schools will need peripheral equipment such as interactive whiteboards, touch monitors, projectors and speakers. For this, PLN 280 million is allocated. So far, 5,600 schools have received the financing. In total, by 2019, 15,500 schools will be equipped with new didactic tools. Free Headlines in your E-mail
