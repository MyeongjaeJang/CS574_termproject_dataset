PDP says abduction & release of #DapchiGirls is “a scam of no equal dimension” By tweet 
Opposition party People’s Democratic Party has described the abduction and subsequent release of the Dapchi Girls as a scam, Punch reports. 
110 girls had been abducted from the Government Girls Science and Technical College, Dapchi in Yobe State by Boko Haram insurgents. 
103 had been confirmed returned by the Federal Government , with 5 reported dead. 
The location of the 2 remaining girls is yet to be revealed. 
National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan , speaking at a press briefing, said the entire abduction was stage managed to score political points. 
The abduction and rescue of the girls is to push the current administration’s reelection bid, Ologbondiyan said. 
We consider as wicked, callous and tormenting to use innocent schoolgirls as pawns in an ignoble script that was designed to hoodwink Nigerians and orchestrate a great rescue and security prowess of a conquering general, all to push a 2019 reelection bid, is an unpardonable gamble with human lives. 
While this failed Dapchi drama remains a poorly crafted tragi-comedy: a scam of no equal dimension, Nigerians are not ready to forgive the APC and the Presidency for the torments inflicted on the girls, their parents and the human community worldwide just to score a cheap political point.
