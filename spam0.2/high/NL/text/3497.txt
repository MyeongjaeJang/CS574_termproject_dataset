The system was dismantled and cleaned before being moved 1,500 miles (2,414 km) to the port of Houston. The cargo underwent further cleaning at the port to comply with Australia's strict import requirement. 
On arrival at the port of Mackay the components were delivered to four fabrication yards in the region for partial assembly and commissioning, before being moved to the final destination in Queensland. 
In a separate project, Conceptum Logistics Colombia delivered a 25,000 cu m cement plant to Antioquia. 
Conceptum prepared a route survey and a number of obstacles and road restrictions were identified. The customer then had the opportunity to modify some of the cargo prior to transit, which resulted in cost and time savings, said Conceptum. 
Moving cargoes measuring in excess of 4.8 m by truck in Colombia requires special permits, which were organised ahead of time. Some items, unsuitable for truck transportation, were moved using modular trailers and barges. 
Conceptum said the move from the port to the final destination had to be completed in just 15 days, in order to comply with Colombia's Customs regulations. SOURCE: HLPFI
