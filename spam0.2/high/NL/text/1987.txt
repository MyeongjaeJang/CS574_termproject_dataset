Ford to provide hotspot, smartphone control to old vehicles from mid-year Wednesday 21 March 2018 | 18:25 CET | News Ford will soon be rolling out an upgrade to its key fob for owners of 2010-2017 vehicles, so that they can get a 4G Wi-Fi hotspot, smartphone control of existing key fob features, vehicle health and security alerts, and vehicle location tracking. The technology was developed byFordPass SmartLink engineers, in collaboration with Aptiv and Verizon Connect. Ford said the upgrade is part of its aggressive connected vehicle plan. By 2019, 100 percent of Fordâ€™s new US vehicles will be built with connectivity. 
Using a simple device that plugs into the OBD II port below the steering wheel, the new FordPass SmartLink will bring older cars up to date, with rollout set to go nationwide in mid-year, exclusively through Ford dealerships. 
FordPass SmartLink customers pay USD 16.99 a month, plus installation, for 24 months to purchase the device and receive telematics services that enable remote key fob, location and vehicle health features. Customers will also get the complimentary trial of a Verizon 4G Wi-Fi hotspot with 1 gigabyte or 30 days of data. To continue use of the Wi-Fi hotspot beyond the initial trial period, customers will have to add their FordPass SmartLink device to their existing Verizon account or establish a new one.
