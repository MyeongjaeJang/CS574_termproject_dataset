Dell EMC debuts Virtual Edge Platform for cloud access Wednesday 21 March 2018 | 19:13 CET | News Dell EMC has introduced a new Virtual Edge Platform (VEP) family and software bundles, saying the software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) system can connect the enterprise edge to the cloud via universal Customer Premise Equipment (uCPE). The new offering uses the new Intel Xeon D-2100 processor and is aimed at helping companies modernise while keeping costs low, reducing complexity and with the ability to scale up as needed. The system was developed for the network edge, including branch offices, and uses software-defined architecture, Open Networking and virtualization to improve network access. 
The Dell EMC VEP4600 provides an open Intel architecture-based platform that can support many virtual network functions (VNF) at the same time. A number of proprietary physical devices can be consolidated into this single uCPE, with a high hosting performance. The system boasts a modular design for easy upgrade or servicing in the field as needed. The VEP 4600 is powered by the new Intel Xeon D-2100 product family, Intel QuickAssist Technology (Intel QAT), and Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK). The platform expands upon Dell EMC's Open Networking initiative, and can rapidly adapt to new service requirements such as routing, firewalling and deep-packet inspection. These additional VNFs can be added to the VEP by customers or Dell EMC if needed. 
There will be three validated systems using the VEP4600. These will provide turnkey SD-WAN capabilities with pre-validated and pre-integrated configurations combining Dell EMC infrastructure and support services with SD-WAN software from Silver Peak Systems, VeloCloud Networks and Versa Networks. 
The Dell EMC VEP4600 will begin shipping worldwide on 24 April.
