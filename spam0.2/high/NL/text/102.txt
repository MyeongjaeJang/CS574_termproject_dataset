Verizon completes test of Cisco's Hybrid Information-Centric Networking Monday 19 March 2018 | 08:10 CET | News Verizon and Cisco are collaborating on accelerating adoption of Hybrid Information-Centric Networking (ICN), Cisco's new approach to content-aware service offerings. By focusing network communication around "named data" rather than location identifiers such as IP addresses, Verizon and Cisco believe they can dramatically simplify next-generation network architecture, enhance user-to-content communication, as well as improve mobility, storage and security in the network. 
In collaboration with Cisco, Verizon said it successfully demonstrated Ciscoâ€™s open-source ICN software and validated its benefits over standard TCP/IP products for optimised mobile video delivery in a lab at the Verizon Innovation Center in Waltham Massachusetts. 
The demonstrated benefits include key features of the ICN communication model which will lead to a better user experience. In the network, forwarding/caching strategies maximise localisation and bandwidth savings in backhaul/core via enhanced multicast. 
Subsequently, Verizon said it also successfully demonstrated key features of Hybrid-ICN by simplifying the insertion of ICN technology in existing IP infrastructure and enabling coexistence with legacy IP traffic. Free Headlines in your E-mail
