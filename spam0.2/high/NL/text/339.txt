No train traffic is currently possible to and from Rotterdam due to a major signal- and switch failure. How long this problem will last is not yet clear. NS deployed buses to get travelers out of the cold and to their destination, AD reports. 
The fault occurred around 9:30 a.m. on the line between Rotterdam and Gouda, but soon spread to the whole region. No trains are running to and from Rotterdam Centraal. 
NS has no idea what caused the failure, and also no idea how long it will take to fix it. ProRail also does not want to give a time estimate. "But the technicians are working hard so that people can get on the train and out of the cold quickly", the rail manager said, according to AD. 
NS deployed express buses between Rotterdam Centraal, Rotterdam-Alexander, and Gouda-Goverwelle. Stop buses are running between Rotterdam-Noord, Rotterdam-Alexander, Capelle-Schollevaar, Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel, and Gouda. Travelers can also use the tram to travel between Rotterdam Centraal and Rotterdam-Noord. Tags:
