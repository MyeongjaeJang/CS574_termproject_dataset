West Europe pay-TV market to have more subscribers, less revenues in 2023 - study Friday 23 March 2018 | 12:39 CET | News 
The Western European pay-TV market will see growth in the number of subscribers between 2017 and 2023, even as pay-TV revenues fall, according to a report from Digital TV Research. The number of subscribers will rise by 2.6 percent, or nearly 3 million, taking the total to 106 million. Growth will principally come from countries with traditionally low pay-TV penetration. More than half of the regionâ€™s net additions will come from Italy, which will add 960,000 subscribers in the period, and Spain, up by 716,000. Germany will add 913,000 subscribers. 
Meanwhile, pay-TV revenues will decline to an estimated USD 27.27 billion in 2023 from 2.11 billion in 2017. Revenues will fall in all but three of the 18 countries covered in the report. The UK will lose USD 628 million over the period, but it will still remain the most lucrative pay-TV market by 2023. Germany, with the most pay-TV subscribers in Europe by far, will see revenues remain lower than in the UK, at USD 3.61 million by 2023. Meanwhile, Italy will overtake Germany in that year.
