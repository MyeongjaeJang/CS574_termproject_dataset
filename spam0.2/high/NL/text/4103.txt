AT&T to install 60,000 white box routers across US   09:58 CET | News 
AT&T announced plans to transition from the traditional, proprietary routers in its towers and small cells to new “white box” hardware that’s built around open standards and can be quickly upgraded via software. The company said it expects to roll out over 60,000 of white box routers “over the next several years” across the US with a view to powering 5G, SDN and edge computing technology. “White box represents a radical realignment of the traditional service provider model,” said AT&T Labs chief technology officer and president Andre Fuetsch, adding that “we’re no longer constrained by the capabilities of proprietary silicon and feature roadmaps of traditional vendors." The company said the white box routers run what it calls a “Disaggregated Network Operating System,” or dNOS , which it hopes to see adopted as open source software across the industry. Orchestrating the dNOS-powered white box machines is ONAP , or Open Network Automation Platform, the operating system for the network cloud backed by AT&T. Just as the ONAP platform has become the open network operating system for the network cloud, the dNOS project aims to be the open operating system for white box, said the company.
