TE SubCom starts construction of key cable landing infrastructure in LA Monday 26 March 2018 | 09:32 CET | News TE SubCom will start on 28 March the construction of a beach landing project in Los Angeles that will serve multiple subsea cables and users in Southern California. The project will use horisontal directional drilling to install bore pipes for the shore-end landing due to the minimal impact this type of operation has on the environment of the beach and tidal area.
