Wire Service California Residents and Workers Learn of Vinyl Chloride Exposure Risks and How to Test for It LA Testing provides analytical services and sampling supplies to identify potentially hazardous chemical compounds to protect employees and the public. Huntington Beach, CA – WEBWIRE – Friday, March 23, 2018 
Back in 1987, the state of California designated the common industrial chemical vinyl chloride as known to cause cancer under Proposition 65. Proposition 65, also known as the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, requires businesses to notify Californians about significant amounts of chemicals in the products they purchase, in their homes or workplaces, or that are released into the environment. 
Vinyl chloride is produced in large quantities for use as a chemical intermediate in manufacturing other products. It is a key component in the production of polyvinyl chloride or PVC as it is commonly known. PVC is used to make a variety of plastic products, including pipes, wire and cable coatings, and packaging materials. 
Vinyl chloride exposure is associated with an increased risk of a rare form of liver cancer, as well as brain and lung cancers, lymphoma and leukemia according to the National Cancer Institute, said Michael Chapman, Laboratory Manager at LA Testings Huntington Beach facility. Workers at facilities where vinyl chloride is produced or used are typically at greatest risk of exposure due to inhalation. In the environment, the highest levels of vinyl chloride are often found in the air around factories that produce vinyl products. 
For those concerned about exposure to vinyl chloride or other potentially hazardous chemical compounds in occupational or residential environments, LA Testing offers solutions. TO-15 testing is available for detecting vinyl chloride in homes and businesses, and NIOSH 1007 testing for worker exposure assessments. If test results identify an exposure risk or hazard, corrective actions can then be implemented to prevent or mitigate these hazards. LA Testing has also sponsored an educational video about vinyl chloride and exposure concerns that can be seen at: https://youtu.be/ZJllvHWQN9w.
