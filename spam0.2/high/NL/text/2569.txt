Mediawan posts first full-year financials Written by Jesse Whittock 2 hours ago 
Paris-listed production-distribution group Mediawan has posted its first full year financials. 
Both actual and pro forma results were published by the company, which launched at the end of 2015 as a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). 
Actual results (including a nine-month consolidation of financials from Groupe AB, which it bought last year) show revenues of €115.7 millon – 3% above target – and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of €25.5 million. 
On a pro forma basis (consolidating AB’s results since January 1, 2017), those numbers become revenues of €163.8 million and EBITDA of €37 million. 
Production and distribution took actual revenues of €34.3 million, with earnings coming in at €19.7 million. The company posted a net operating loss of €3.1 million. 
Since listing in 2016, Mediawan has acquired AB, Apocalypse producer CC&C, the French TV business of EuropaCorp and drama producer Makever, and is set to close deals for On Kids & Family and Mon Voisin Productions. 
It has also been linked with deals for French channels group NRJ Group and international distributor Wildbunch, but management has denied both scenarios. 
The company is known to be looking at international expansion, however. “We wish to associate with content producers in Germany, Spain and Italy,” Capton told DTVE sister title TBI in an exclusive interview that will publish in the April/May magazine. 
Mediawan has been well received on the French stockexchange, with the likes of Sycomore Asset Management, Amiral Gestion, Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan GT Corporation all investing in the business. 
Telco magnate Xavier Niel, 3ème Oeil Production boss Pierre-Antoine Capton, and financier Matthieu Pigasse are co-founders and each own 6.69%.
