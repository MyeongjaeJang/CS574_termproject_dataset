Teleology to partner Safaricom as part of 9mobile transformation   10:30 CET | News 
Teleology Holdings has revealed its ten-point agenda for 9mobile, ThisDay reported. Teleology plans to implement the agenda by the time it takes full ownership of 9mobile, after pays the balance of the USD 500 million price within 90 days. Having partnered Safaricom, the biggest telecoms operator in East Africa, to transform 9mobile, Teleology said it would be engineering-led, to enable it to compete with existing telecoms companies in Nigeria, who must have gained more market share during the 9mobile financial crisis. 
According to its director, the former managing director of MTN Nigeria, Adrian Wood, 9mobile is entering a new phase and will deliver value to employees, customers, local communities and indeed to all stakeholders. He said that the new organisation would be engineering-led and brand driven, and will strive to ensure that 9Mobile operations deliver fulfilment to customers, empower communities, protect the vulnerable, and provide rewards to shareholders and all stakeholders. 
Wood added that Teleology has set out a ten-point plan that aggregates its mission and how it intends to turn the 9mobile organisation around. Part of the plan is to double the 9mobile network with new 3G/4G mobile sites as well as a several thousands of kilometers of fiber-optic cable across the country. It will drive a special programme of rural internet coverage, focusing on 4G with broadband access planned for all of Nigeria's 774 local government areas.
