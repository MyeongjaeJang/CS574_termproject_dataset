Vodafone Spain launches EUR 31 a month standalone fibre offer   14:15 CET | News 
Vodafone Spain has followed its low-cost MVNO brand Lowi by announcing the launch of a standalone fibre-optic service. Customers prepared to sign up to a 2-year contract will pay EUR 31 a month for 50Mbps fibre, some EUR 5 more than Lowiâ€™s offer but with access to a fixed line with unlimited calls as well as a mobile line with 500MB of data plus the zero-rated Chat Pass service. Those wanting higher speeds can access fibre broadband at download speeds of 120Mbps, 300Mbps and 1Gbps for EUR 39, EUR 43 and EUR 56 a month respectively. The Vodafone TV Total service will also be included for free for the first 3 months, rising to EUR 24 a month thereafter.
