The Chicago Bears signed former Jaguars wide receiver Allen Robinson on Wednesday, the team announced. 
The deal is for three years and is worth $42 million, with $18 million fully guaranteed, according to NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport. Robinson was ranked No. 3 in NFL.com’s Top 101 Free Agents of 2018. 
Robinson’s 2017 season came to an abrupt end after he suffered a torn ACL in Week 1. 
Jacksonville allowed Robinson to hit free agency, opting not to tag the 61st overall pick of the 2014 draft. 
The 24-year-old Penn State product’s best season was 2015, when he caught 80 passes for 1,400 yards and scored 14 touchdowns.
