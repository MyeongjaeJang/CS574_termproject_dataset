MTN Cyprus organises internet safety seminars in schools Tuesday 20 March 2018 | 15:19 CET | News MTN Cyprus said it's organising educational seminars on internet safety in Junior High and High Schools all over Cyprus. The first seminar successfully took place back in January at the Mitsis School in Lemythou, with nine more seminars following throughout Cyprus. With the production of a short video titled "Your choice" which focuses on online bullying, MTN aims to make students and especially teenagers more aware on this issue that increasingly affects the Cypriot youth. MTN's training and educational seminars take place in collaboration with the well-known actor Andreas Phylachtou, who also stars in the produced video. 
In addition to the video shown during the seminars to the student community, the educational app iWhiz, which was created by MTN in collaboration with the Cyprus Pedagogical Institute, is also presented during the seminars. iWhiz is available for free for iOS and Android devices through the official app stores.
