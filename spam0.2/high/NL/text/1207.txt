h 2018, the opening of the 18th annual computer graphics and animation competition for children took place in the School Centre. This years theme is The Hermitage and Russian Ballet, dedicated to the Year of Russian Ballet being celebrated in the country. 
The competition is organized by the museums School Centre in conjunction with the State Hermitages Volunteer Service and the St Petersburg Computer Technology Educational Centre of the Academy of Supplementary Vocational Training.

Irina Valeryevna Diubanova, the head of the School Centre, told participants in the event about the history how the theatre came into being in Ancient Greece. Guides from the Department for Scientific and Educational Work took the children on tours of the Hermitage, drawing their attention to works connected with the theme of dance and music. Workers from the Volunteer Service spoke about the history of ballet, about the first ballet performance that took place in the Menshikov Palace in 1736 and about the first ballet school that was housed in the Winter Palace of Peter I, now part of the Hermitage museum complex. At the end of the event, everyone who wanted was able to learn a few ballet movements by taking part in a dance lesson.
