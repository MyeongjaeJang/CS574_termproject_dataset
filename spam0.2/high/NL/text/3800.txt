Utrecht University, Leiden University and Maastricht University are organizing a two day conference on Procedural rights in criminal proceedings in the European Union, offering a venue for practitioners and young scholars to exchange experiences and ideas on this subject matter. We aim to: Identify whether the transposed directives on procedural rights for suspects and accused persons, together with the CJEU case law lead to convergence of procedural rights for defendants in legal practice; Identify the role of these measures for transnational cooperation; Identify the further impact (side-effects) of the directives in the national criminal procedures: Discuss possible future initiatives in this area; Involve practitioners and young researchers and offer the latter a platform to discuss their ideas with senior experts.
