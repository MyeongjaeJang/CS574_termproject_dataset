Jubbaland President speaks about tension in Beled-Hawo town March 25, 2018 0 
The President of Somaliaâ€™s southern Federal Member State of Jubbaland Ahmed Madobe has for the first time spoken about the brewing tension in Beled-Hawo near Kenyan border. 
The President has refuted the allegations that Kenyan is encroaching on Somalia territory as it resumed construction of the security wall on the border to thwart Al Shabaab attacks. 
Madobe added that his administration will release a statement announcing its decision towards the land boundary case and the current rising tense situation in Beled-Hawo city. 
On the other hand, a precarious calm has returned to the border town after three days of tension between local residents and the Kenyan forces over the construction of the fence. 
In 2015, Kenya has started construction of a 435-mile wall along its porous border with Somalia as part of efforts to shut out Islamic militant group al-Shabab. SHARE
