Lebanon licenses 3 firms to supply FTTH Monday 26 March 2018 | 15:38 CET | News 
Lebanon’s Ministry of Telecommunications (MoT) has licensed three providers to rent capacity on Ogero’s fibre-optic network in order to connect end-users to FTTH, reports BusinessNews. The providers are GlobalCom Data Services (GDS), Connect and TriSat. 
Habib Torbey, chairman of GDS, said that packages through the FTTH project will be moderately priced above the current cost of DSL. FTTH speeds will be superior and will reach up to 100 Mbps, with higher consumption capacities. 
The companies are also authorised to supply users with added-value content that passes through the same connection. The MoT will finalize the geographic distribution assigned to each company within two months. 
The license, according to Nassif Bechara, CEO of Connect, confirms that Ogero remains the sole owner of the fiber network, and Ogero will perform maintenance of the network. Torbey said that they can deploy additional fibre only in specific areas where cables are not available. 
The revenue-sharing model differs among the three companies. Connect and TriSat will pay 40 percent of their revenues to the telecom ministry, compared to 20 percent for GDS. Torbey said that the companies will pay an additional USD 1/metre/year as rental fees for the network, in addition to transmission fees between Ogero central exchanges and the used cables, and rent fees for the routers. 
GDS and Connect started a pilot project in 2017 to deploy their own private fibre networks in specified geographically dense locations as a part of the FTTH project. But the State Council (the Shoura) ruled in January in favor of an objection and suspended the license. The new contracts will replace the suspended decision.
