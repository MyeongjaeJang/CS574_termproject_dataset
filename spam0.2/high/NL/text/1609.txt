EU opens registration for city Wi-Fi vouchers tender   10:30 CET | News 
The European Commission has opened registration for municipalities interested in obtaining funding under the WIFI4EU scheme. The first tender for the vouchers worth EUR 15,000 will start in mid-May. 
The WiFi4EU programme offers funding for municipalities to set up Wi-Fi hotspots in public spaces. Municipalities can use the WiFi4EU vouchers to purchase and install Wi-Fi equipment in their chosen centres of local public life. Costs for maintaining the network will be covered by the municipality. 
A total of EUR 120 million is available under the programme until 2020, for all EU member states and Norway and Iceland. The vouchers will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis, with each country receiving at least 15 vouchers. Four more tenders will be held over the next two years.
