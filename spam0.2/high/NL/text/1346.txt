Roku announced that its advertising VoD app The Roku Channel is expected to be available this summer on selected Samsung smart TVs. End-users don't need subscriptions or logins and are not charged to access The Roku Channel. It's ad-supported and features approximately half the advertising per programming hour as compared to traditional linear TV. Launched late in 2017, The Roku Channel is already a top 20 channel on the Roku platform offering consumers hundreds of Hollywood hit movies and TV shows.
