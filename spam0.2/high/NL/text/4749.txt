Batelco, Huawei partner to work towards broadband network and safe city services   11:30 CET | News 
Batelco and Huawei have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to strengthen their cooperation on the development of safe cities and the National Broadband Network in Bahrain. They aim to assist the government in achieving the targets outlined in its Fourth National Telecommunications Plan, which calls for 100 percent access to reliable, secure and affordable broadband by 2019 for all businesses, as well as 95 percent for private households. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Huawei and Batelco will work together to promote the development of the National Broadband Network. They will also combine their expertise to explore how to promote the development of safe cities in Bahrain. Huawei has a wide portfolio of products that can be deployed to enhance the safety and living standards in urban areas by increasing road safety, infrastructure security and sanitation as well as decreasing pollution and the risk of terrorism and cybercrime. 
Safe city servicess can also decrease the response time of police and first responders to crises through the deployment of a digital platform that aggregates inputs from multiple data sources (sensors, mobile devices, cameras) for actionable and immediate intelligence.
