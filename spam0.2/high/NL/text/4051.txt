Alibaba launches AliGenie 2.0 human-computer interaction platform Monday 26 March 2018 | 08:12 CET | News Alibaba Group has launched its newest human-computer interaction platform, dubbed AliGenie 2.0. According to Alibaba, the product enables “sight” so that the platform can do everything from reading bedtime stories to children in Chinese to recognizing different medicine bottles. The platform was developed by Alibaba’s A.I. Labs, and is used in Alibaba’s Tmall Genie voice-controlled speaker in China, the only market where it is currently available. Powered by AliGenie, the device can understand commands in Mandarin Chinese. 
Once connected to Alibaba’s Tmall online marketplace, users of Tmall Genie can order items from the platform by speaking to the device. With A.I. Labs’ voiceprint-recognition service, the device will only place orders when it is activated by the voice of authorized users. In the future, developers plan to add a facial-recognition function to expand the interactive experience. 
AliGenie 2.0 is also equipped with visual-recognition capability, meaning it can identify various objects that it detects. Users start by downloading the ‘Genie FireEye’ app to their mobile phones, then attach their smartphones to a phone holder called the ‘XHolder’, which is connected to Tmall Genie. 
In partnership with Chinese publishers, A.I. Labs has enabled the device to recognize the covers of 117 sets of children’s books and read them aloud. To make the function work, users must scan the book cover with the front-facing camera of their mobile phone while inside the app. The device can also recognize select flashcards, which helps Chinese-language learners read Chinese characters. Moreover, along with pronouncing the words, an animation will appear on the screen to explain the origin of the word.
