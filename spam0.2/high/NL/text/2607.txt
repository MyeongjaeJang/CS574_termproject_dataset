Vodafone Germany opens 5G data centre in Berlin   15:30 CET | News 
Vodafone Germany has opened its first high-security data centre for 5G applications in Berlin, the first of four "Supercore Centres" that Vodafone plans to open in Germany, reported OnlineKosten.de. Mobile, cable and fixed line data should in the future all converge at the centre and be sent to the recipient, while data can also be processed there instantly, wrote Online-Kosten. 
The Berlin Supercore Centre can handle 22 million GB of data daily and is four times faster and 20 times stronger than Vodafone's previous databases. Vodafone said it laid 1,500 kilometres of fibre-optic cable for the centre, whose security features includes preventing third party access to data. Construction of other centres has already begun in Munich, Frankfurt and Dortmund. Free Headlines in your E-mail
