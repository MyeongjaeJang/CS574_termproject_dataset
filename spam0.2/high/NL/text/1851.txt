NASUWT has issued a notice of strike action to East Dunbartonshire Council following its failure to tackle management practices which the union says “have an adverse impact on the workload and working conditions of teachers”. 
Notices of strike action on Tuesday 27th March 2018 have been issued in three schools, Kirkintilloch High School, Lenzie Academy and Bearsden Academy. 
This is the Union’s initial response to the Council’s failure to act to support teachers. If progress is not made then more action in these and other schools could follow. 
Notwithstanding its national dispute with the Scottish Government, which is ongoing, the NASUWT is now also embarking on a programme of action in local authorities who fail to address teachers concerns. 
Ms Chris Keates, NASUWT general secretary, said: “Whilst the government must take responsibility for the year-on-year deterioration in teachers’ pay and conditions, there are actions that employers have the power to take locally to address some of the concerns raised by teachers and alleviate some of the pressures on them. 
“It is disappointing that we have been forced to take action in East Dunbartonshire, but having attempted to engage in constructive discussions to work together on these issues, regrettably the Council changed its position and instead of confirming it would work with us on the issues we had raised, would only commit to them informing local discussions.”
