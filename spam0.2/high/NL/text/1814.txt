FreedomPop Spain to phase out freemium plan   14:40 CET | News 
US-based MVNO FreedomPop is preparing to finally phase out the ‘freemium’ plan it launched in Spain nearly two years ago as part of a tariff revamp that will see the price of its plans rise across the board, reports Movilonia. FreedomPop was the only Spanish operator to offer a basic free plan that included 100 minutes of calls, 200MB of data and 300 SMS. However, due to what the operator describes as “increasing fraud and abuse” that plan will be replaced by the ‘Esencial’ tariff with another 100MB of data (300MB in total) for EUR 2.99 a month. Starting on 01 May, the operator will also be raising the price of its other 'premium' plans, with the 2GB, unlimited calls and unlimited SMS plan hiked to EUR 10.99 from EUR 8.99 a month.
