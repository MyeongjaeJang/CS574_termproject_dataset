Somali forces launch a security operation in Mogadishu March 19, 2018 0 
Somali security forces have continued their routine operations in Mogadishu, expanding to remote districts in a bid to prevent Al Shabaab from carrying out attacks in the capital. 
Several suspects were detained during an overnight security operation in Kahda district in connection with the latest attacks and assassinations in the area, according to the locals. 
The local authorities declined to comment on the operations, but, sources told Radio Shabelle that the suspects have been taken into Police custody for further questioning. 
This came after Al Shabaab has killed several security force members in Kahda district last week as part of its attacks targeting Mogadishu, the seat of the UN-backed Federal Government. SHARE
