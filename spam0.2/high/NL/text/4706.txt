Share on: google + With it being the international break, the major leagues in Europe halt for one week, as the countdown to Russia and team selection-shaping friendlies take centre stage. However, for Colin Doyle, a goalkeeper for both the Republic of Ireland and English League One side, Bradford City, this wasn’t a ‘break’ at all. The 31-year-old joined his international team for their friendly match out in Turkey, playing an entire game in Istanbul as Turkey defeated Ireland 1-0. However, there was no time to reflect on the defeat. A flight back to Dublin straight after the game and then onto a flight to Leeds Bradford shortly after, and Doyle was soon playing again. This time helping Bradford to a one-nil win – their first victory since January 1st. “By the last 20 minutes, I had nothing left. I couldn’t kick the ball,” he told BBC Radio Leeds. He also claimed that in terms of fuel, “I had a lovely little fry-up in the hotel with a bit of black pudding, bacon rashers, sausages and eggs. That was my fuel.” A traditional Irish breakfast it seems, was the secret to this incredible feat – although not many nutritionists would recommend that meal before a game. Or indeed after it. However, for completing two full matches in 24 hours, Colin Doyle is our Man of the Weekend.
