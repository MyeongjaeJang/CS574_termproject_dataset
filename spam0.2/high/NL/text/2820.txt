BOR - 22 Mar 2018 Victims of Bor demolition decry poor living conditions, demand compensation 
About 480 families whose homes were demolished in Hai Salaam neighborhood of Bor town in South Sudan’s Jonglei State are concerned about their living conditions and are appealing for government intervention. 
Several Hai Salaam residents told Radio Tamazuj on Tuesday that their homes were demolished in mid-February leaving them homeless and vulnerable to harsh weather conditions. 
Achai Dwet, one of the residents said since they were demolished the government has not supported them in any way. 
“We were just told to leave the place, we left and nobody has come to see us. The government asked us to leave and they said they will resettle us but until now nobody has come. We cannot go to work, our children are getting lost and our elderly are dying in the sun since February,” she lamented. 
Another resident who identified himself only as Lual said if they are allocated lands elsewhere they will move to restart their lives. 
“We have not been told where to go. We are still waiting for the government to allot land to us. If they tell us where to go we will go. Now we are just here sleeping outside, the dust is a lot and there is a lot of winds nowadays the rains are about to come. The elderly people are here, children are here. The government should show us where to go so that we can start our lives,” Lual said. 
For his part, Bor Town Mayor James Gai said the site has already been identified and the allotment of plots will begin next week.
