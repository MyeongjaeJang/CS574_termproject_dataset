JUBA - 26 Mar 2018 Kiir meets with remaining two SPLM-FDs members in Juba 
South Sudanâ€™s President Salva Kiir Mayadit met today with the only remaining two members of the former detainees group in Juba, transport minister John Luk Jok and MP Madut Biar Yel. 
Foreign Minister Deng Alor, leader of the group in Juba, has been in Kenya since the second phase of the revitalization forum was suspended on February 16. Deng said recently that he was being humiliated Kiir and some cabinet ministers since he started to serve in the unity government in Juba. 
In a press statement after the meeting, Minister John Luk said they discussed with Kiir issues pertaining to peace and reconciliation in South Sudan. 
The opposition official also said they discussed the revitalization process of the 2015 peace deal, besides the unification of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM). 
SPLM-FDs is a faction made up of senior ruling party officials who were detained when the conflict began in December 2013. 
The group members in exile have recently called on President Kiir to step down for the sake of peace in South Sudan. Share this
