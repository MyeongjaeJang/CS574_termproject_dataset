A five-star resort for horses: Qatar's Al Shaqab equestrian center cnn.com 
Did the last hotel you stayed in have a swimming pool, beauty parlor, gymnasium, personal trainers, maternity unit and en suite performance arenas? 
Of course it didn't. 
Which means in Qatar there are horses probably enjoying better facilities than you. 
At Al Shaqab, a vast horseshoe-shaped complex on the outskirts of the Qatari capital Doha, horses experience a refined lifestyle that more closely resembles a five-star spa resort than a traditional stud farm. 
They enjoy leg-stretching gallops on a private racetrack, daily grooming sessions and individually tailored fitness programs. At night or during the desert heat of midday, they retire to spotless air-conditioned stables. 
If they had hands instead of hooves, these thoroughbred beauties would probably be dialing room service. 
Built around the site of historic stables, Al Shaqab is a gleaming, ultramodern equestrian facility that reflects both Qatar's obsession with horses and the tiny oil-rich country's desire for opulent status symbols. 
It's a worthwhile destination for horse fanatics visiting or transiting through Doha. Public tours can be arranged via the center's website and even non-horsey travelers are likely to find a visit here fascinating. A five-star resort for horses
