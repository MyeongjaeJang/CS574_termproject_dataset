March 27 events featuring NSF: 
PAWRing Smart and Connected Communities: Driving Research and Impact Opening Keynotes, 8:30-10:10 a.m., Room 2103AB Jim Kurose , NSF assistant director for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), will deliver a keynote address on the Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) program, a joint effort by NSF and a wireless industry consortium to create city-scale testing platforms that accelerate fundamental research on wireless communication and networking technologies. 
SONYC Audio Mapping the Smart City Opening Keynotes, 8:30-10:10 a.m., Room 2103AB Urban noise pollution is one of the topmost effectors of quality of life and mental health for city residents. The NSF-funded Sounds of New York City (SONYC) project enables cities to identify, monitor and mitigate the noise pollution in the city through a novel system to continuously map the local soundscape. The system aims to help city planners and residents better understand their environment and make it more livable. Speakers: Juan Bello and Charles Mydlarz, New York University; Cecil McMaster, New York City Environmental Protection. 
Smart and Connected Communities: Keynote Panel 10:20-12:05 a.m. , Room 2103AB NSF program director Jonathan Sprinkle will moderate a discussion among NSF-funded academic researchers and community partners about how they formed their partnerships and research projects, how they work together, and rules for successful community engagement. Speakers: Jonathan Sprinkle, NSF; Farrah Cambrice, Prairie View A&M University; Mayor David Allen, City of Prairie View, Texas; Hilary Boudet, Oregon State University; Rachel DiFranco, Sustainability Manager for City of Fremont, California; Hamed Tabki, University of North Carolina at Charlotte; and Robert Phocas, Sustainability Director for the City of Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Smart and Connected Energy-Aware Communities 10:20-12:05 a.m. , Room 2103AB An NSF-funded research team will discuss its goal of fostering energy-aware residential communities by providing feedback and incentives based on large-scale data analytics and predictive modeling. Speakers: Panagiota Karava, Purdue University; Jacob Sipe, Executive Director for the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority; and Gary Hobbs, Chief Executive Officer for Black and White Investments, LLC.
