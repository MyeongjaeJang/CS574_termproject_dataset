JUBA - 19 Mar 2018 Foreign Affairs ministry denies dismissal of former France Ambassador 
The ministry of foreign affairs and international cooperation in South Sudan has denied a report claiming that former Ambassador to France Akec Khoc has been dismissed from service. 
The ministry’s undersecretary Baak Valentino told Radio Tamazuj on Sunday that the report is false. 
“There is nothing like that. It is untrue. Ambassador Akec Khoc was recalled to the headquarters after finishing the period he was assigned as the head of mission to France, which is a normal administrative procedure,” he said. 
“A diplomat is posted and recalled after the end of the period of assignment. This happens to everyone in Foreign Service,” explained Baak. 
Some relatives of officials who were recalled from external postings and not reassigned have repeatedly protested the delay in new postings while others believe that a recall amounts to dismissal from service.
