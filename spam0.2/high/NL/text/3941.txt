New Delhi: Rani Mukerji’s latest venture ‘Hichki’ saw an outstanding growth in terms of the collection on day 2 of its release. As per industry experts, the film collections jumped to 62 percent on Friday to record 5.35 crore net. The total collection of the film now stands at 8.65 crore net after two days of its release on March 23. 
Trade analyst and film critic Taran Adarsh on Sunday tweeted that the film is expected to perform better on Sunday. Here’s what he posted: 
In the film, Rani plays the character of Naina Mathur who has a nervous system disorder – Tourette Syndrome that forces an individual to make involuntary repetitive movements or sounds. 
The story moves smoothly (without any hiccup) as we are introduced to Naina Mathur aka Rani Mukerji. She suffers from Tourette Syndrome, a neurological condition which starts from the onset of childhood and results in several motor tics and at least one vocal tic sounds. As the lead actress suffers from this condition, the society finds it hard to accept her. 
The movie has been directed by Sidharth P Malhotra and produced by Maneesh Sharma and Aditya Chopra under the banner of Yash Raj Films. The film is an adaptation of the book, Front of the Class: How Tourette Syndrome Made Me the Teacher I Never Had by Brad Cohen, of which Yash Raj Films acquired the rights. The film was made at a budget of Rs 12 crore. ALSO READ
