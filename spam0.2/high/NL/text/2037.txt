A body was found in a home on Akkerweg in Wijchen on Wednesday morning. The police responded to the home around 5:50 a.m. after receiving a report that the windows were blackened. The police suspect that a fire broke out "a few days earlier" and then burned itself out, De Gelderlander reports. 
When firefighters entered the home, they found the body of a man. The victim has not yet been identified, but the police believe it is the occupant of the home. 
The police believe that this was an accident, not a crime. "In the case of crimes we often receive other information", a police spokesperson said to the newspaper. "For example from the background [of the victim] or that a door has been broken open. Together that determines whether it is a suspicious situation." 
The cause of the fire and the cause of the victim's death are still unclear. The police are investigating. Tags:
