Around ten people were injured in an overcrowded nightclub in the Noord-Holland town of Schagen on Thursday night. Panic arose on the second floor of nightclub Alpha when someone became unwell in the massive crowd. The club was evacuated for a time, local safety office Veligheidsregio Noord-Holland-Noord said on Twitter 
One victim was taken to hospital with pain in the chest. Seven to ten people sustained minor injuries and were taken to a nearby fire department barracks to be checked over by paramedics. 
An annual Easter cattle show, called Paasvee, is currently ongoing in the town, according to RTL Nieuws. The event brings large numbers of people to the town each year. 
Emergency services responded to the night club en masse, according to newspaper AD. Multiple ambulance, an air ambulance, and several police units were at the scene. Schagen FM reports that the police had a lot of trouble keeping the crowds of partiers at a distance. Police dogs were used to help clear the area and the entire street was closed down. 
The club was reopened around 8:00 p.m. - less than an hour after it was evacuated, local safety office Veligheidsregio Noord-Holland-Noord said on Twitter. 
During Paasvee, cattle are exhibited in the town center, according to AD. There is also a small animals show, a mechanization fair and performances by DJs. Alpha had James Morano and Jesse Benjamin on the line up on Tuesday. Tags:
