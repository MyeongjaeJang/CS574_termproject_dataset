Former CEO Bernabe to take over TIM security mandate - report Wednesday 21 March 2018 | 08:43 CET | News 
The former CEO of Telecom Italia (TIM) and current lead independent director Franco Bernabe could take over the powers of deputy chairman Giuseppe Recchi, according to unnamed sources cited by Il Sole 24 Ore. Recchi announced his imminent departure as deputy chairman back in January but has yet to relinquish his position and still retains organisational responsibility for the operator’s Security Department, including key assets such as international operator Sparkle and ICT subsidiary Telsy. The so-called “golden power” ruling issued by the Italian government last year in a bid to scale back the influence of France’s Vivendi required an Italian citizen with security clearance to be appointed to handle Sparkle, with Bernabe, who was TIM CEO from 2008-11, fitting that role, said the report. Sources indicate that he could also temporarily take on the executive functions held by TIM chairman Arnaud de Puyfontaine, who may have to suspend them to discuss strategy following activist fund Elliott’s move to build a stake in the operator.
