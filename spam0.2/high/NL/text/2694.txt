TfL is launching a new scheme with the Association of Cycle Traders and e-bike retailers to help raise awareness of the benefits of e-bikes and encourage more Londoners to take up cycling. 
Research by TfL shows that more than a fifth of people who don't cycle are put off because they think they aren't fit enough, feel distances are too long or say they are too old. 
E-bikes can help overcome these concerns as the power assisted bikes allow the rider to cycle further, and uphill, with ease. 
Now TfL and the Association of Cycle Traders have launched a website to allow Londoners to benefit from exclusive discounts and improved access to e-bikes to encourage more to take up cycling. 
This website, available through www.tfl.gov.uk/electric-bikes , brings together more than 100 stores offering free test rides across the capital - meaning that everyone can try an e-bike that suits them. 
TfL has also negotiated exclusive offers on e-bikes with many retailers, which are only available through the website. 
Will Norman, London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, said: “I've enjoyed trying a number of e-bikes and can see what great potential they have to help Londoners get around our capital. 
“We're working hard to make cycling safer and more accessible, and these e-bikes can make a difference to those who feel unable to travel by bike. 
“By providing a boost as you pedal, the bikes help riders cycle with ease but still improve their health too. I hope through this new partnership we can encourage even more first-time cyclists to take to our capital's streets.”
