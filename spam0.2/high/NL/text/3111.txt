Ugbaad Kilincci, the PvdA candidate city councilor who faced various racist remarks while campaigning on Saturday, will have a seat in the Emmen city council. She received 1,007 preference votes in the municipal elections on Wednesday, RTV Drenthe reports. 
While campaigning in Emmen last weekend, Kilincci was called, among other things, a "ragged-head moron", a "black monkey", and told to "go back to Africa". Various politicians, including PvdA leader Lodewijk Asscher and parliamentarian Sharon Dijksma, expressed their support for Kilincci after the incident. 
Now it seems she also has the support of many Emmen residents. Kilincci was actually 12th on the PvdA's candidate list for Emmen. But thanks to over a thousand preference votes, she will get one of the four city council seats the PvdA won in Emmen in he municipal elections. Tags:
