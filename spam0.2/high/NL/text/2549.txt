Earlier we posted a video of Jacquees getting arrested on South Beach, but at the time it was unclear why he was arrested. 
Now more details about the arrest have become available. 
According to TMZ , the singer was arrested for allegedly driving without a seatbelt. 
Sources revealed that he was driving down Ocean Drive in a Lambo when an officer pulled him over for failure to wear a seatbelt. 
He was asked to present his driver’s license but reportedly refused to do so. The officer asked him to get out of the car, which he did, but he refused to walk to the sidewalk. 
Cops say that’s when Jacquees yelled, “Do not touch me.” 
He was arrested and booked for failure to obey a lawful command, and for the seat belt infraction, which is both misdemeanors.
