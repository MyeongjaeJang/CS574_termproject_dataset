Tigo Bolivia (Millicom) intends to invest some USD 150 million this year to substantially expand its fibre-optic and LTE networks, reports local daily El Deber, citing Millicom CEO Mauricio Ramos. The aim is to increase the operatorâ€™s fibre-optic footprint from half a million to 800,000 homes by the end of 2018, said Ramos, adding that the LTE network will also be extended to improve the current 4G penetration figure of just 20 percent. He also revealed that Bolivia accounts for some 10 to 15 percent of Millicom's total annual revenues of US 6 billion-plus.
