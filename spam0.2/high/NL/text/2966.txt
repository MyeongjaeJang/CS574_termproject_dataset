 Cepsa: Southern Europe Gets 1st Multi-Product Supply Ship CEPSA Spanish oil and gas company Compañía Española de Petróleos (CEPSA) presented the first multi-product marine fuel supply vessel in southern Europe on March 22.
Based in Spain’s Port of Huelva, the vessel Oizmendi will provide ship-to-ship liquefied natural gas (LNG), in addition to traditional fuels, fuel oils and diesel.
The unit has a new fuel measurement system, based on Mass Flow Meters technology, which guarantees the accuracy in the supply of fuel to vessels. It has an LNG load capacity of 600 m3, 1,900 tons of fuel oil and 470 tons of diesel.
This new initiative is part of the CORE LNGas Hive project, launched by the European Commission to promote the use of gas as a fuel for transport contributing to the reduction of CO2 emissions in the Atlantic and Mediterranean European maritime corridors.
“The new supply vessel provides great flexibility to meet the needs of our customers, as we can provide traditional marine fuels alongside more innovative fuels in the same vessel, such as liquefied natural gas, covering the entire value chain and providing the energy that each client requires,” Alberto Martinez-Lacaci, Cepsa’s marine fuel director, said.
