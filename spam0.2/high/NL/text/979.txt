Highly skilled freelancers have driven growth in UK self-employment by Jasmin Swayne 20 March 2018 Category Contracting News 20 March 2018, Comments 0 
Contrary to claims that the burgeoning growth in self-employment in the UK has been driven by a new “precariat” working in the gig economy, a new study has found that it has in fact been propelled chiefly by highly skilled freelancing and contracting professionals. 
A new report from Kingston University and the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self Employed (IPSE) shows that the number of highly skilled freelancing and contracting professionals in the self-employed sector has, since 2008, climbed by 46% to reach two million. 
The increase in highly skilled freelancers comfortably outstripped overall growth in the self-employment, which climbed by 26% since 2008 to reach 4.8 million. Last year, highly skilled freelancers represented 46% of all lone self-employed people, a category that refers to all who chose to work for themselves. 
The study also reveals that the contribution made by flexible workers and the solo self-employed to the British economy reached a new total of £271bn in 2017 – an increase of £16bn on the £255bn they contributed in 2016. Skilled freelancers alone contributed £125bn to the economy in 2017, an increase of £6bn on the 2016 total of £119bn. 
The study’s key findings are as follows: At 4.8 million, the UK’s self-employed now constitute 14% of the country’s workforce, with 4.4 million of them working alone with no employees (lone self-employed) 46% of the lone self-employed are expert freelancing and contracting professionals The average age among contractors is 47, while for the solo self-employed as a whole it is 46 The gender mix for flexible workers is 43% female, 57% male (35% and 65% for the solo self-employed respectively) Since 2008, the number of female freelancers (67%) has grown more than twice that of males (33%). The largest proportion of freelancers are located in the South East of England (24%), with London coming in second (20%) and South West England coming in third (10%). The highest number of flexible workers (320,000) work in media, literary and artistic occupations, followed by proprietors and managers in other services (236,000), functional directors and managers (135,00) and education or teaching professionals (134,000). 
Emphasising that with growth like this, the government cannot neglect or overlook the well-being of the skilled contracting community, IPSE CEO Chris Bryce said: 
“The report goes a long way to dispelling the myth that activity in the self-employment sector is occurring mainly in the ‘platform’ or ‘gig’ economies, when the real growth is in highly skilled freelancer occupations.” 
The government, he added, “must do all it can to enable and protect freelancers and the self-employed – both in the Brexit negotiations and beyond.”
