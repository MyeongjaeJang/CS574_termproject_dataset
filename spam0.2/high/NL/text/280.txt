The book is designed to help young children enhance their speech and language skills and includes many stimulating games and activities that are not only developmentally appropriate but also aid in the growth of their brain advancement. 
TALK, PLAY, AND READ WITH ME MOMMY is divided into three stages (infancy, toddlerhood, and preschool) with each stage providing appropriate activities and games. Gramlich believes in the importance of early communication between the parent and the child and thus creates this educational resource.
