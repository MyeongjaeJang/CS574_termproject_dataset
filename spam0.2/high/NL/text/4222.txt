Universal Robots partners with AIM in the Philippines March 26, 2018 by Anna 
Universal Robots aims to meet growing demand in the Philippines through its new partnership with Asia Integrated Machine, Inc. (“AIM”). 
AIM, a machinery and automation solutions supplier, provides solutions for manufacturing firms, including processing, weighing, packaging, inspection, conveying, palletising and warehousing. 
The partnership will see AIM deploy and offer customised automation solutions comprising end-effectors and accessories for UR’s collaborative robots (cobots). 
AIM is UR’s second channel partner in the Philippines after Elixir Industrial Equipment, which has been instrumental in growing UR’s distribution base in the country since 2016. 
Shermine Gotfredsen, General Manager, Southeast Asia and Oceania at Universal Robots, said: “The Philippines is an important market for us, with strong adoption of UR cobots in the electronics, automotive and F&B industries that has surpassed our expectations. We see further potential for the country as it trails behind its regional counterparts in automation adoption. 
“The International Federation of Robotics ranked Philippines among the lowest in the region for automation adoption with a robot density of three industrial robots installed per 10,000 employees in 2016, behind Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia with robot density of 488 units, 45 units and 34 units each.”
