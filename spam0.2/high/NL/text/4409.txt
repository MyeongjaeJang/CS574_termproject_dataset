Sanlorenzo celebrated the launch of the second vessel in their 52Steel line of superyachts yesterday in Italy. Named KD and designed by Officina Italiana Design, SuperYacht Times were on scene to capture the 52-metre superyacht in detail as she was lowered into the water during her christening ceremony.

The same area easily turns into a floodable garage to accommodate the owner’s tender: the floor of the beach area lifts up to make room for the compartment where tenders up to 8 metres can be stored. ”
