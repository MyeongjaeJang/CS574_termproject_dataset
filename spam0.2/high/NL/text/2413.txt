Italian shipyard Baglietto has announced that the 48-metre displacement superyacht currently under construction in La Spezia is nearing completion, following the delivery of her sister ship, Andiamo , last year. Scheduled to be ready for delivery in summer this year, she is currently for sale, offering a unique opportunity to purchase a brand new quality superyacht in a fraction of the usual waiting time. 
Measuring 47.6-metres, the vessel is designed by Francesco Paszkowski, with Baglietto’s in-house design team undertaking her interior design. On board, she accommodates up to 12 guests, with a full beam owner’s suite on the main deck. A crew of nine are also accommodated for on the lower deck. 
Notable features on board include a large beach club area, a number of al fresco dining spaces to make the most of the superyacht lifestyle, and room for two tenders and two jet skis on the foredeck. 
In regards to her performance, twin CAT 3512 engines provide her with a top speed of 16 knots, a cruising speed of 12 knots, and a transatlantic range of 4,500 nm at cruising speed. 
The new Baglietto 48m is available to purchase. To get in touch to hear more about the project or for more information regarding Baglietto, head to their website or get in touch with the team at .
