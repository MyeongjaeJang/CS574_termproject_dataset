Z370 Mini-ITX motherboards review: a small coffee Three Z370 Mini-ITX motherboards compared By Reinoud Dik Saturday March 24, 2018 11:59 PM Introduction 
With Coffee Lake we also saw the introduction of the Z370-chipset. Of course this also means a new set of motherboards. This includes Mini-ITX motherboards, which we compare in this review. Today we take a look at the ASRock Fatal1ty Z370 Gaming ITX/ac , the ASUS ROG Strix Z370-I Gaming and the Gigabyte Z370N-WiFi . 
Although the HTPC is on its way out thanks to good built-in multi-media support of televisions and devices like the Nvidia Shield, the Mini-ITX form factor remains very popular. The shift from ATX to Micro-ATX seems to be retroactive, but thanks to the possibility of powerful hardware in a small enclosure ITX remains. You cannot use multiple graphics cards using this format, quad channel memory or big processor coolers. However, this does not mean that you cannot build a powerful system at 17 by 17 centimetres, because with the advent of a larger number of cores on the mainstreamsockets there is more computing power than ever before on Mini-ITX. 
Just like with Z370 where hardly anything changed compared with Z270, the names of the ITX-motherboards manufactured by ASRock, ASUS and Gigabyte are very predictable: change the 2 to a 3. The ASRock board has an average price of 247 dollars, ASUS asks 264 dollars on average and Gigabyte is quite a bit cheaper at an average price of 202 dollars in our Price Comparison. As before, Gigabyte stands out because of the lower price.
