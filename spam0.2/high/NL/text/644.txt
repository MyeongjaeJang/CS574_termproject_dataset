This year’s edition of the annual St Barths Bucket came to an end on Sunday after four days of tight racing for a fleet of three J Class yachts. An additional 23 superyachts joined the old-school racers for three days in the unpredictable waters off the Caribbean island in what is known as the world’s most prestigious regatta.

Svea dominated the leaderboard over the four days as Valsheda and Topaz battled it out for the second and third spots. Svea is the lasts yacht in the J Class fleet and was launched at Vitters in 2017 and took part in her first Bucket regatta this year.
