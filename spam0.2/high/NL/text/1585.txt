E-commerce company Jumia aims to increase its sales of mobile phones to 80,000 during its Mobile Week from 30,000 during the same event in 2017, according to e-marketing director Karim Ahmed, the Daily News reported. Ahmed said the company expects 10 million website visits during the week, when it is offering discounts in partnership with Samsung, Xiaomi, Sico and Soda. 
Jumia said that the Xiaomi Redmi 5A achieved success in the first minutes of a flash sale on the first day of Mobile Week, which runs from 18 to 25 March. Phone sales reached over 15,000 units in the first two hours. GfK, a market research institution, expects a rise in smartphone sales in Egypt of 2 percent this year from 2017, when global mobile sales reached 1.5 billion, according to Karim Masara, GfK business manager. Mobile phone sales are expected to grow strongly in the Middle East and North Africa region this year. 
Masara said that Egyptian mobile sales reached about 18 million devices in 2017, according to GfK research, at a value of around EGP 35 billion. He said that 60 percent of the growth in revenues is attributed to currency exchange rate differentials. Egypt floated the value of its national currency in November 2016. The value of the dollar rate appreciated against the pound to over EGP 17.
