The new 300 tonne Grove GMK 6300L-1 
23 March 2018 
Grove is to launch a new version of its six axle 300 tonne GMK6300L, the GMK6300L-1. 
Improvements include new engines and improved load charts, made possible by redesigned structural fabrications which, according to the company have improved load charts by an average of seven percent. 
The improvements increase on longer boom lengths, rising to 16 percent in the 70 to 80 metre lengths, with 14 tonnes capacity on full boom and at up to 28 metres radius. Capacities have increased by up to 16 percent 
Maximum tip height is 120 metres, with fully extended 80 metre main boom and 37 metres of extension. The crane remains a dual engine unit with two Mercedes Euromot 4/EPA Tier 4 final diesels with improved fuel economy over their predecessors. The carrier engine is matched to an Allison torque converter transmission. 
The steering and suspension systems remain unchanged. While the counterweight slabs and auxiliary hoist are interchangeable with the GMK5180-1, GMK5200-1, GMK5250L and GMK6300L. 
All Terrain product manager Andreas Cremer said: “The GMK6300L, along with the GMK6400, effectively kick started a new era of Grove All Terrain cranes, setting unprecedented industry standards in terms of reach, capacity and mobility. 
To date more than 400 units have been delivered. With its significantly improved load charts and specifications, we expect the GMK6300L-1 to prove just as popular.” SOURCE: Vertikal.net Liked this post?
