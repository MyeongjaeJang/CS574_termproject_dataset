ZTE announces breakthroughs in single-wavelength 50G PON, big-video transmission   14:19 CET | News 
ZTE unveiled a new architecture platform for single-wavelength 50G-PON bi-directional symmetrical transmission and what it calls an industry-first big video transmission platform that was tested on the basis of commercial G-PON technology at the 43rd edition of the Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exposition (OFC) recently held at the San Diego Convention Center, California, USA. With the research breakthroughs, ZTE said it's currently able to provide products and transmission standards-compliant new technologies for next-generation high-speed PON access. 
ZTE said the two crucial achievements released at OFC 2018 signify its outstanding contributions to the development of NG-PON technology. Using PAM-4 high-order modulation and advanced digital signal processing algorithms, ZTE completed the validation of the industry's first bi-directional symmetrical single-wavelength 50G-PON platform that enables PR30 power budget. As a major direction in the evolution of NG-PON technology, single-wavelength high-speed PON has a simple transceiving structure and is easy to operate and maintain. 
At OFC 2018, ZTE also conducted the industry's first test of high-quality 4K/VR big video real-time transmission based on commercial G-PON technology. Along with the test, ZTE introduced a future-proof PON transmission platform that employs fine granular bandwidth allocation to enable high-bandwidth and low-latency services including 4K/8K/AR/VR.
