In 2017 two-thirds of Americans receive their news from social media. Between 2016 and 2017 for Twitter, YouTube and Snapchat it has been over a 10 percent increase in the amount of people that use them for news outlets. The study also said the social media increase within older, nonwhite and less educated Americans. It is usual from a person to go from one social media site to the next to compare news but also to get more news information. 
Journalists need to take advantage of social media because it can transfer information quickly and to many people. No journalist should solely depend on social media but when they want to get a quick story out there or share something that relates to their storyline social media outlets are a good form of communication. 
In 2018 I think the social stock will continue to rise. More people are hopping on the bandwagon of looking online instead of watching news stations. It is more convenient but also quicker to just read a post on twitter or Facebook rather than sitting watching the news waiting for that one important topic to come up. It also allows people to see what others have to say and engage when you want. 
What most surprised me was the fact that after testing 176 twitter users 61 percent did not tweet more than 10 times over a four week span. People are going on the social media sites to just look not even necessarily share their own personal opinion. The thing that least surprised me was the amount of tweets that are retweets. If you are searching for news when you find something you retweet, maybe give an opinion and keep scrolling it is not often that a person just tweets their own thoughts all day.
