Heavy Lift News Important news for the heavy lifting sector Video: FIRST EVER Boeing 747 at Groningen airport Eelde! Atlas air 747 landing and take-off (4K) 
18 March 2018 
The Boeing 747 visited Groningen airport for the very first time on march 13th, 2018. Hundreds of people were watching her landing after a flight from Portland! It was an amazing sight to see at such a small airport, since we usually only get planes like the 737, ATR72, A320, etc. 
This Atlas air 747 arrived with soldiers, who are participating a big militairy training in The Netherlands. 
Nearly 3 hours later, the Queen of the skies departed to Kuwait. Hopefully they'll be back sometime :) I hope you will enjoy watching, and I apologize for the shakiness, but since it was freezing cold and I was standing on a small ladder, it was difficult to keep the camera steady ;) 
More information below! 
Plane: Atlas air 747-446, N464MC Flight: CMB529 Route: PDX-GRQ Camera: Sony FDR-AX53

I would like to dedicate this video to 99carnot. He sadly passed away last week, due to cancer.. 99carnot, also known as Steve, was a plane spotter from Washington. He was always supportive, kind, and loyal to other youtubers. He was one of my first subscribers, and always watched my videos. It's a huge loss for the aviation community. 
I hope you'll receive this message, Steve. We will miss you, thank you for everything you've done for the whole aviation community on Youtube!
