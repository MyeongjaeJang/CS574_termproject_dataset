IBM planning partial sale of IT segment to Bechtle - report   13:07 CET | News 
IBM Germany has internally announced plans to sell off parts of its IT service segment IBM Global Technology Services (GTS) to the IT service provider Bechtle, reported German business publication WirtschaftsWoche (WiWo). The sale would affect several hundred support jobs across Germany in software maintenance and project implementation at IBM corporate customers, they wrote. According to IBM’s plans, these employees will transfer to Bechtle by the middle of this year as part of a division transition, wrote WiWo. 
IBM’s businesses have been suffering for years due to the boom in cloud computing, as customers increasing choose to rent software via the internet rather than purchase it outright, wrote WiWo. The company has also been outsourcing more and more support functions to partners in recent years given that cloud products require fewer consultants, they added. IBM confirmed that the company was holding “negotiations about a partnership” between GTS and Bechtle and said it planned to inform employees about the talks’ progression. IBM currently employs roughly 16,000 people in Germany. Free Headlines in your E-mail
