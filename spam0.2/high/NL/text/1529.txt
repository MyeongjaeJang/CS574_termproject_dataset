BT, CWU reach deal to reform pensions for 20,000 non-managers Tuesday 20 March 2018 | 10:28 CET | News 
BT has reached an agreement with the Communication Workers Union (CWU) on the future pension arrangements for 20,000 non-manager employees. This will result in the closure of its defined benefits scheme, the BT Pension Scheme (BTPS), to future benefits in early-summer 2018. 
BT is aiming to close this down from 31 May, in line with a previous announcement in relation to closing the scheme for managers. However, this timetable could be affected by complicated administrative issues. BT and the CWU have agreed to establish a 'hybrid' pension scheme which combines elements of both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes. 
BT has also announced a number of improvements to benefits for employees already in the BTRSS, the company's primary pension scheme for new employees since 2009. The BTRSS has 35,500 active members. The changes include increasing BT's standard maximum contribution rate to 10 percent for all members. Separately, BT has also agreed a 2-year pay deal with the CWU for team members (non-managers), which will see a 3 percent increase in both 2018 and 2019.
