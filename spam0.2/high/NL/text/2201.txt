Written by DTVE Reporter 1 day ago The explosion of digital content is “helping to drive viewing off the TV” with mobile devices accounting for 60.3% of video starts in the fourth quarter of 2017, according to Ooyala. The company’s Global Video Index Q4 2017 report claims that mobile video plays could soon reach – and potentially exceed – a 70% market share, driven by more premium sports assets moving online. “The primary screen is definitely shifting. All devices are not equal for video viewing,” said Jim O’Neill, Ooyala principal analyst. “Consumers are as comfortable watching a sporting event, TV show or movie on a smartphone as they are on a connected TV, but not on their PC or tablet. Ooyala said that mobile plays topped 60% for the first time – with smartphones accounting for 47.5% and tablets for 12.8% of video plays. According to the study, over-the-top video services doubled their hours of content offerings over the last 12 months, with long-form content increasing 159%, medium-form content offerings increasing 87% and short-form content increasing 112%.
