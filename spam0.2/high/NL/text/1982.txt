Injury forces change to all-Irish clash on Frampton-Donaire Undercard By Joe O'Neill   
The intriguing and long-suggested clash between Phil Sutcliffe and Tyrone McKenna has been cancelled – however an interesting all-Irish fight has taken its place. 
The Dublin v Belfast showdown was one of three major all-Irish bouts set for the Frampton v Donaire undercard at the SSE Odyssey Arena on Saturday April 21st. 
Unfortunately, this afternoon, it has been confirmed that Crumlin puncher Sutcliffe [14(9)-2(1)] has been forced out of the bout with a knee injury. Widgets Magazine 
Thankfully, a strong replacement has been found for Lenadoon southpaw McKenna who will now engage in a Belfast derby with Anto Upton [17(6)-1(0)] who has stepped in. 
The youngest of the fighting Upton brothers had called previously for a fight with the winner of McKenna’s cancelled bout with Tommy Coyle last year. 
The former English champion has been rebuilding over the past while under new coach Ray Ginley in Belfast and will now dive into a huge fight with McKenna [15(6)-0-1]. 
No title has been assigned to the bout, however it would now be eligible to be the first BBBoC Northern Ireland Area title fight in over five years and the first light welterweight title clash since Jamesy Gorman outpointed Gary Hamilton over ten years ago. 
Alongside this fight, there is also an all-Irish clashes between Conrad Cummings and Luke Keeler at middleweight and Jono Carroll and Marco McCullough at super featherweight. Share this:
