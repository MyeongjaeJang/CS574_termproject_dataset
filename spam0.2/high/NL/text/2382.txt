Brazil president launches national digital transformation plan   11:16 CET | News 
Brazil's President Michel Temer has signed a decree launching a new digitisation strategy for the country. The 'Estrategia Brasileira para a Transformacao Digital', know as E-Digital for short, includes over 100 measures to boost the adoption of digital platforms and services in the economy and society over the next four years, the communications ministry (MCTIC) announced. 
The strategy was developed and will be led by an interministerial working group, coordinated by MCTIC. It was put to public consultation last year and received more than 2,000 comments. 
The plan builds on a number of existing initiatives, such as the national IoT plan, efforts to bring broadband to schools and expanding mobile coverage with the 700 MHz band. The main focus areas are network infrastructure and internet access; research, development and innovation; confidence in the digital environment; education and professional training; and international efforts.
