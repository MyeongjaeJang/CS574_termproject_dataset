Hungary's mobile phone subscriptions in Hungary decreased by some 32,000 in 2017 to 11.76 million, according to local paper BBJ citing Hungary's Central Statistical Office (KSH). The number of mobile subscriptions per 100 residents was unchanged at 120.4. 
As in previous years, post-paid subscriptions became more numerous compared to pre-paid ones. By the end of 2017, 64.2 percent of customers were post-paid and 35.7 percent were pre-paid, up from ratios of 60.1 percent and 39.9 percent, respectively, at the end of 2016. The KSH said most new customers pick post-paid contracts, while some pre-paid subscribers switch to post-paid contracts due to lower per-minute charges and data options.
