Share on: google + It’s been announced that British fashion hero, Kim Jones, has moved into a new prestigious role – that of Art Director at Dior Homme. Formerly of Louis Vitton, the designer has been involved within the football world in recent weeks, bringing his stylistic nous to a pair of Nike Mercurial boots that none other than Cristiano Ronaldo wore for Real Madrid in Europe. Now back into a permanent role in the upper echelons of the fashion world, Jones’ first collection with Dior will debut at Paris Fashion Week in June. Kim Jones x Nike Mercurial Kim Jones has since announced that he is “deeply honoured to join the house of Dior, a symbol of the ultimate elegance. I would like to warmly thank Bernard Arnault and Pietro Beccari for their trust in giving me this incredible opportunity. I am committed to create a modern and innovative male silhouette built upon the unique legacy of the house.” Previously, like something from a transfer window, Kim Jones had been linked to positions at Burberry and Versace. But it is Dior Homme who will now be largely lead and influenced by Kim Jones.
