Commercial property services group Cushman & Wakefield said on Tuesday the Netherlands is the fourth most attractive centre for high-tech companies in its annual Manufacturing Risk Index , which looks at 42 countries worldwide. 
‘The fact that the Netherlands is so high in the list is largely due to the development of several knowledge centres and campuses where R&D goes hand-in-hand with concrete high-tech production industry,’ said Jan Verhhaegh, head of Cushman & Wakefield Industrial. 
‘A prime example of this is the High Tech Campus in Eindhoven combined with the new Brainport Industries Campus. In Leiden there is the similar Bio Science park and Delft has its High Tech Campus and Betafactory,’ he said. 
The Netherlands scored only 34 th in C&W’s list of traditional production countries, which is dominated by Eastern Europe and Asia. Features
