Swiss telecom law amendment progresses slowly   11:09 CET | News 
The Swiss Parliament's Commission for Transport and Telecommunications (KVF) wants to postpone a decision on the Telecommunications Act's revision until the Government provides requested clarifications. KVF is seeking information on the definition of market dominance in association with the regulation of network access. 
According to the government's draft , SMP operators will be obliged to provide access not only to traditional copper wires,but also fibre-optic cables. These plans have been criticised by Swisscom. Alternative operators, in contrast, welcome the revision plans. 
KVF wants to conduct hearings on the access regulation, but also on 5G implementation and network blocking. A detailed consultation should begin in July. 
The draft Telecommunications Act amendment will also tackle high roaming charges and advertising calls.
