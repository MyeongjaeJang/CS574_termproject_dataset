SKT to set up LTE-based communication network for Seoul subway Monday 26 March 2018 | 17:04 CET | News SK Telecom entered into a contract with the Seoul Metropolitan Government to set up a LTE-based mobile telecommunication system for railways on a section of the subway in Seoul, writes local publication koreatimes.com.kr citing a company announcement from 26 March. The operator said the network, called LTE-R, will ensure underground safety and connectivity in case of accidents and other emergency situations. The network supports mobile video calling on a high-speed train. 
SK Telecom will deploy the LTE-based network on a 7.7-kilometer-long railway extension from Sangil-dong Station in Seoul to Changwoo Station in Gyeonggi Province. Called the Hanam Line, the section is an extension of Line 5. The company also plans to create a navigation system that allows engineers to check details of trains in real time. Seoul Metropolitan Government and the Seoul Metro will continue to replace old communications networks put together on Line 2 and 5 with LTE-R starting with the Hanam Line. The bidding announcement for these projects will be made within the year, officials said. 
In February 2017, the company said it deployed the world's first LTE-R on the Busan subway Line 1.
