Swiss National Council wants to eliminate legal hurdles for autonomous cars Friday 23 March 2018 | 11:20 CET | News 
The Swiss National Council wants to reduce the legal hurdles for the introduction of autonomous vehicles, reported Inside-IT.ch. It has adopted a motion from the Green Liberal Party, which requests the appropriate legislative changes by the Federal Council, specifically relinquishing human control of the steering wheel, changes in insurance law, and collection and storage of camera and sensor data. 
The Federal Council is ready to accept the proposal. Now the Council of States has to discuss the motion. Earlier motions dealt with questions about how to regulate autonomous vehicles. 
Germany has already passed a law on autonomous cars and regulated, among other things, liability issues. In the US, the debate over proper regulation has rekindled after a self-driving Uber car was involved in the first fatal accident. Free Headlines in your E-mail
