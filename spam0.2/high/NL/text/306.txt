The MVNO Komplett Mobil, which runs on the Telenor Norway network, said it has now achieved 50,000 subscribers since its establishment in summer 2016. It said that in 2017, its first full year of operation, it won the title 'Best mobile subscription' in three out of four categories for five months in a row at consumer website Tek.no. The MVNO belongs to the consumer electronics e-commerce company Komplett. 
Managing director Haakon Dyrnes said that Komplett Mobil sets store by offer customers products that they like and need, with the aim of making the MVNO the obvious choice. Mobile subscription sales is a demanding market, dominated by major firms such as Telia and Telenor. The duo accounted for 92.3 percent of the private customer mobile market in the first half of 2017. 
Building up a customer base is no simple task, nor is achieve viable margins, in such a market. Dyrnes said for this reason, it is satisfied with the number of customers that it has worked hard to achieve. He said regulation is important to ensure competition. 
The company said that Komplett Mobil is one of a number of firms operating in the mobile market that belong to larger companies whose core businesses are rather different. Other examples are Get and Fjordkraft, it said. Drynes said the adventage of being part of the well-known umbrella of the Komplett shopping site will become clear to customers gradually, adding that he would return to what this meant in concrete terms another time.
