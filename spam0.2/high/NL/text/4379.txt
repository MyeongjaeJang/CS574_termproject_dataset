Mohamed Salah’s Agent Dismisses Rumours Suggesting Star Set to Stay at Liverpool 
Liverpool superstar Mohamed Salah ‘s agent has shut down a report indicating his client had told friends he’s ready to shun Real Madrid ‘s interest and stay at Anfield beyond this summer’s transfer window. 
John Richardson of the Mirror wrote that Salah disclosed to his friends that he would remain at Liverpool “ for the foreseeable future,” but his agent, Ramy Abbas Issa, addressed the matter: 
Richardson also suggested Liverpool preparing a new £200,000-per-week contract for Salah, another claim that will be called into question after Issa’s rebuttal. 
It’s unsurprising a club of Real’s magnitude has been linked with a move for the Egypt international. After all, he’s made up for the January loss of Philippe Coutinho at Anfield, according to three-time European Cup winner and Reds legend Terry McDermott, per Goal: 
Salah has overturned his reputation in the Premier League after previously faltering at Chelsea , surpassing his achievements from his two-year stay at AS Roma . 
While the winger’s agent might have dismissed suggestions Salah is set to remain with Liverpool, there is also no reason to believe that isn’t his intention. 
Issa’s tweet merely pointed out his client doesn’t discuss such matters with friends rather than signal any sort of departure is on the horizon. 
Liverpool would be wise to devote some resources toward properly compensating their talisman, however, as fan account Empire of the Kop highlighted the pay imbalance in the squad: 
The Merseysiders would be 13 points worse off in the Premier League this season if one took away the 28 goals he’s netted in 30 outings, roughly one fifth of their points tally and ample reason to offer him a new deal. 
One need only look at the attacker’s international scoring record to see Salah’s class carries across wherever he plays, per The Independent: 
Issa’s desire to tackle speculation regarding Salah’s Anfield future may be seen as a positive for Real, with the Liverpool hero yet to make any sort of new commitment on Merseyside.
