Over a quarter (27%) of US consumers have more than three smart home devices, and another 7 percent own two or three, according to a survey by GfK. In total, half of all people surveyed had at least one smart home technology, rising to two-thirds of Millennials (25-34 year-olds). 
Among 11 up-and-coming digital technologies measured by GfK, consumers cited smart home as the most likely to impact them. Payments were the only other emerging device or service that topped the 50 percent mark (52%), while wearables, cloud computing and connected cars all scored between 30 and 40 percent. 
Nearly six in ten (58%) of US consumers said smart home – defined as a "smart house in which most things are interconnected" – is likely to change their lives in the next few years. The level of agreement was higher (68%) among those aged 25 to 34, while teens and young adults (18 to 24) were in line with the total market (57%). 
The findings are based on 1,000 online interviews with US consumers; the sample has been balanced by age, gender, and region.
