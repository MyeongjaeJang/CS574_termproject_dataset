Former “Cosby” star #KeshiaKnightPulliam and her estranged husband #EdHartwell’s divorce case is just dragging, y’all! He filed all the way back in July 2016 and when Keshia responded, she alleged that Ed wanted to kill their then-unborn child and requested for him to undergo mental evaluation. 
Keshia actually enlisted the help of Dr. Bennet Omani, the #CTE doctor who was portrayed by #WillSmith in the “Concussion” movie. According to @TMZ_Tv, the only issue is that Ed denies ever being treated by Omalu and has asked the judge not to allow him to testify in the divorce case. 
Ed says the doctor has never interviewed him nor, to his knowledge, has he looked at his medical records. He also does not agree with Keshia bringing in Dr. Omalu at the last minute and says it’s a foul move on her part! 
We’ll keep y’all updated on the mess!
