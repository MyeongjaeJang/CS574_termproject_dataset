An employee of Amsterdam water company Waternet is suspected of embezzling 1.5 million euros. In a period of around six months, he five times had 300 thousand euros deposited into his account by putting his own account number on other people's invoices, the Telegraaf reports. 
The employee, Nico B., has been working for Waternet for 20 years, according to the newspaper. He worked in the creditors' department. The fraud was discovered in December last year. ING warned Waternet about B. - the bank noticed that B., who was constantly lagging behind in payments, suddenly had a lot of spare cash, the newspaper writes. 
Waternet reported B. to the police. 
According to the Telegraaf, B. gambled the money away in online casinos. Tags:
