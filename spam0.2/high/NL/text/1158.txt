Dialog Semiconductor USB PD chipset adopted by Hosiden for latest smartphone adapters   15:14 CET | News Dialog Semiconductor announced it's shipping in high volume its USB Power Delivery (USB PD) chipset to Hosiden, a Japanese manufacturer of charger adapters for mobile devices. The chipset is used in Hosiden’s CBC2153 model USB PD-compliant adapter, designed for one of Japan’s mobile telecommunications providers. 
Dialog’s USB-PD chipset is designed specifically to meet consumer demands for today’s high-performance mobile device travel adapters. As a state machine-based product, it eliminates the need for a MCU and many additional external components, resulting in higher power density in a small charger case, at lower cost . 
Dialog said its iW656+iW1791+iW676 USB PD chipset provides significant protection features, including Dialog’s SmartDefender advanced hiccup technology that addresses soft short circuits, helping to prevent excessive heat build-up and damage in charger cables and connectors for safer, more reliable rapid charging. In addition, automatic AC un-plug detection protects the phone battery from high voltage damage if the charger is unplugged, then re-plugged in to the mains with the charging cable still connected.
