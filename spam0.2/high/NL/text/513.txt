Wire Service World TB Day and Protecting Workers from Exposure Risks The American Board of Industrial HygieneŽ (ABIHŽ) reminds workers and industry of the need to protect and educate employees about infectious diseases. Lansing, MI – WEBWIRE – Monday, March 19, 2018 
Occupational exposure to M. tuberculosis is preventable if workers are properly trained, have access to respiratory protection, and effective environmental and infection control procedures are put in place. 
March 24 th is recognized as World TB Day. This annual day of recognition commemorates the date in 1882 when Dr. Robert Koch announced his discovery of Mycobacterium tuberculosis , the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. Almost 134 years after this important discovery, tuberculosis (TB) is still one of the top 10 causes of death according to the World Health Organization (WHO). While a significant portion of these deaths occur each year in developing countries, this disease also impacts people in developed nations. Additionally, the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) are a potential threat to everyone. WHO reports that tuberculosis mostly affects adults in their most productive years and that people with active TB can infect 1015 other people through close contact over the course of a year. The ability for the disease to spread in communities, including healthcare environments, correctional institutions, and anywhere people or workers congregate in close proximity for an extended period of time, is a concern. TB is contagious and can be spread from person to person through droplets containing M. tuberculosis in the air if individuals with TB disease of the lungs or larynx release the bacteria when they cough, sneeze, talk, or otherwise expel air. said Dirk Yamamoto, CIH Ž and Vice Chair of ABIH Ž . Fortunately, occupational exposure to M. tuberculosis is preventable if workers are properly trained, have access to respiratory protection, and effective environmental and infection control procedures are put in place. World TB Day is the perfect reminder for employers and employees from high-risk occupations to work together to eliminate this deadly disease. In work environments and communities across the globe, Certified Industrial Hygienists (CIHs) are uniquely qualified to help with these efforts. CIHs are trained in biohazards, air sampling, health risk analysis and hazard communication, engineering controls and ventilation, work environments, community exposure, and personal protective equipment. These and other core competencies of the CIH Ž program are instrumental for helping to prevent the spread of TB in high-risk environments and to protect the health of all workers.
