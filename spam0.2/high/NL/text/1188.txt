Casper Pillow 
A good pillow can be the difference between a night of restful sleep and a literal pain in the neck. The team at Casper knows this and designed a pillow that provides comfort and support regardless of your sleeping position. They've invented a unique pillow-in-pillow with a firm inner core and a soft outer shell. Thanks to the even fill distribution of silky fibers, the pillow won't lose its shape. It's also finished with breathable percale cotton to keep airflow moving and your pillow cool. It's even machine washable. Take advantage of the 100-night trial, and if you don't love it, Casper will give you a free refund.
