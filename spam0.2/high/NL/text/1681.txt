Asset lifecycle services specialist Bilfinger Salamis UK has been awarded a ‘multimillion-pound’ contract for technical manpower services on Shell UK Limited southern North Sea (SNS) assets. 
Bilfinger said on Wednesday that the three-year contract covered the execution of maintenance operations services on the offshore Leman Alpha Platform, Clipper, and Seafox 4 barge. 
The deal also covers work on the onshore Bacton Gas Plant as well as on the Kroonborg Walk-to-Work vessel supporting NAM in the Dutch sector. The contract will be managed from Bilfinger’s Great Yarmouth base. 
Bilfinger Salamis UK’s managing director, Sandy Bonner , said: “Bilfinger has worked extensively with Shell and NAM for many years. Shell’s decision to award this contract to us is a testament to the strong, collaborative relationship we have.” 
According to the company, over 150 personnel will transfer to Bilfinger Salamis UK from the incumbent contractor, in electrical, mechanical, pipe fitting, welding, crane, and rigging disciplines. In January alone, Bilfinger recruited and rehired over 600 personnel in the UK. 
The company is a major player in the SNS, having had a presence in the region since 1981. 
Ken Badenoch , Bilfinger SNS general manager, added: “Great Yarmouth is an important strategic location for Bilfinger, and we are committed to further strengthening our capabilities in the southern sector. 
“We have continuously invested in infrastructure, technology and processes, positioning the company as a major provider with the capability to provide a fully integrated MMO service offering in both Aberdeen and Great Yarmouth.” 
Bilfinger said it currently had 250 personnel in its Great Yarmouth base and looked to increase its team following this contract award. 
“Bilfinger will be actively recruiting to strengthen our MMO capability, with positions from graduate through to management,” added Badenoch. Share this article
