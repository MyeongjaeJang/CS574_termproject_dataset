Portuguese parliament rejects left proposal to renationalise PT Monday 19 March 2018 | 10:51 CET | News 
The Portuguese parliament has rejected a proposal from the Left Bloc party to renationalise the DTT network and PT's fixed network to provide universal telecoms service. The Bloco de Esquerda, or Left Bloc party had argued that Altice failed to fulfill its obligations for the services and as such should have its concessions revoked. 
The BE and PAN parties voted for the measure, while the PS, PSD and CDS-PP voted against, and PCP and PEV abstained in the proposal to revise the Telecommunications Law. 
A separate proposal by the Greens and Communists (ENP and PCP) calling for the liquidation of Portugal Telecom in order to defend national and workers interests was also rejected by the Parliament. Free Headlines in your E-mail
