KAPOETA - 19 Mar 2018 Hunger kills 5 in Kapoeta State 
South Sudanâ€™s Kapoeta State governor Louis Lobong Lojore says at least five people have died of hunger in his state, as he appealed to humanitarian organizations to hurriedly provide food aid to the most needy to prevent more deaths. 
Speaking to Radio Tamazuj on Sunday, Lobong said two people died in Kauto and three in Magoth Counties of the state. 
He added that the aid agenices that were operating in the area have suspended their operations due to recent increased insecurity.
