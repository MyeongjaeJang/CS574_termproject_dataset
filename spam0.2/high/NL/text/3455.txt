MARIDI - 23 Mar 2018 Maridi airstrip to be relocated and upgraded soon 
Maridi state government says the relocation of the state airport to Nabazia area in Mboroko Boma about 7 KM from town will start next week. 
Speaking to Radio Tamazuj on Wednesday, the Maridi state minister of physical infrastructure and public utility Alison Barnaba said the relocation is necessary to avoid accidents of people and animals that have encroached on airstrip land. 
“We have changed the location because the previous airport in Maridi is already surrounded by the citizens even animals are grazing around and the place has become narrow and it is risky for the flights to land,” Barnaba said. 
“This will be a national airport which will be raised to international airport in future,” he added. 
Minister Barnaba noted that the construction of the new airport is supported by the national government. Share this
