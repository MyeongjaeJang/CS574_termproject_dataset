Philips Lighting, which is traded as LIGHT on the Amsterdam stock exchange, is to change its name to Signify. 
The company said in a statement that ‘the choice of our new name originates from the fact that light becomes an intelligent language, which connects and conveys meaning’. 
The products, however, will continue to be marketed under the Philips brand. 
Philips Lighting’s roots date back more than 125 years to the lightbulb business founded by Frederik and Gerard Philips in 1891 in Eindhoven. The company was spun off by electronics giant Philips in 2016. 
The name change still has to be approved by shareholders in May. Features
