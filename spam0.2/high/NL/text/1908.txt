Large-scale battery to counter power outages launched March 20, 2018 by Anna 
Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd. has developed a container-type large-scale energy storage system for instantaneous voltage drop countermeasures, and has released the developed system to the market in cooperation with Japan Facility Solutions, Inc., a 100％ subsidiary of Tepco Energy Partner, Inc. 
The energy storage block of this system uses the olivine-type iron phosphate lithium-ion battery “Fortelion”, manufactured by Murata subsidiary Tohoku Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., and is used in combination with an AC-DC converter made by Meidensha Corporation or Yamabishi Corporation. 
Instantaneous voltage drop (a momentary drop in power system voltage) such as due to lightning strikes to power transmission lines may have a large impact, such as stopping production in factories. 
Data centers and factories that manufacture high value-added products, such as precision instruments, require a more stable power supply than ever before. 
Murata’s newly developed container-type large-scale energy storage system uses olivine-type iron phosphate as the cathode material, which has a high safety standard without concerns of fire and realizes a useful lifespan of up to fifteen years. 
In addition, the developed system provides a higher amount of power than that of general lithium-ion batteries, which leads to installation space savings. 
It also has a demand response function that can help to level power supply by making use of energy storage to achieve efficient energy use. 
Murata will continue to develop high input (2C charging) high output (6C discharge) large-scale energy storage systems, and provide various solutions that realize not just instantaneous voltage drop compensation measures and demand response, but also mitigation of short-term fluctuations and adjustment of frequencies.
