Kalejdo Bredband says it has got together with Bahnhof to establish a nationwide, open distribution network for Internet of Things (IoT services) aimed at metropolitan networks, under the name Sakernas Stadsnat. The software has been written by the company Indentive, and is called Connective. Kalejdo marketing director Martin Linden said Bahnhof's national coverage reaches most of Sweden’s local grids, enabling Kalejdo to supply IoT services to those networks. 
Sakernas Stadsnat can be used to deliver commercial services as well as social ones, in a secure manner. The open platform will offer services from a range of providers, as well as borough councils’ own ones. It can connect up sensors, gateways and other equipment. Free Headlines in your E-mail
