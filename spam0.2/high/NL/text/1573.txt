Brazil regulator Anatel is working on releasing more spectrum for mobile operators soon. President Juarez Quadros said at the Telesintese Meeting in Brasilia that the 700 MHz band could be auctioned as soon as this year and Anatel is also looking at opening up the 3.5 GHz band. 
The remaining frequencies in the 700 MHz band are "close on the horizon", Quadros said, and could be auctioned yet this year. The regulator is working on a schedule for spectrum sales in order to provide predictability for investment, he added. A reassessment of the spectrum management model is also in public consultation. 
Of the 58 regulatory projects that will be initiated or approved by the Board of Directors of Anatel by the end of this year, 20 are related to spectrum management, with a special emphasis on 5G technology, Quadros said. According to the president, Brazil is at the forefront of the efficient and rational use of spectrum in the world, and could be one of the pioneers of 5G services in 2020. 
Anatel is also looking for a solution to interference in the 3.5 GHz band, where free-to-air TV is provided over satellites in the C band. The aim is to reach a solution similar to clearance of the 700 MHz band. Free Headlines in your E-mail
