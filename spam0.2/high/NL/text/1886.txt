ASA bans Sky unlimited broadband ad after BT complaint   15:35 CET | News 
The UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has upheld a complaint filed by BT against a national press ad for Sky, published in October 2017, which stated 'Get Unlimited Broadband At Our Best Prices'. 
BT said the ad implied Sky was offering their best prices ever and challenged whether the claim was misleading and could be substantiated. The complaint was upheld by the ASA, which ruled that the did not clarify the basis for the claim and that the 'our best prices' claim was likely to mislead consumers. Sky cannot use the ad again in its current form.
