Orange Poland introduces 5G Programme, demonstrates 6.2 Gbps with Nokia   13:57 CET | News 
Orange Poland has introduced its 5G Programme. The first tests are planned for 2019 and implementation for 2020-2021. The presentation of the programme was accompanied by a demonstration of 5G applications by Nokia. The key requirement for the implementation of 5G technology in Poland will be the availability of radio spectrum. 
The 5G Programme includes topics such as architecture of radio and backbone network, network security, 5G standard, tests, inter-operator cooperation, cooperation within the Group Orange and dialog with regulators. First, it will be necessary to create a business ecosystem for 5G and first applications. Tests are planned for 2019; they will initially include several separate regions and will later be conducted network-wide. 
The operator is also cooperating with device and technology suppliers to offer 5G services to clients in 2020-2021, said Jean-Francois Fallacher, CEO of Orange Poland. 
Award of licences for frequencies in the bands 3.6 and 3.8 GHz will be crucial for implementation of 5G in 2020-2021. 
Orange and Nokia demonstrated data speeds of 6.2 Gbps with a block of 400 MHz and using 8Ã—8 MIMO (8 transmitting and 8 receiving antennae). Such speeds have so far only been possible in laboratory conditions, as the biggest spectrum block in the bands 3.5 and 3.7 GHz is 28 MHz. The system was designed in cooperation with MIMESYS, which was used during the demo. It can be used for training and teleconferences via mobile network. In the future, it can also allow for the creation of lighter and easier to use devices that virtual and augmented reality. 
Nokia has been cooperating with Orange Poland for a long time on innovations in fixed and mobile network services and infrastructure. Nokia. Nokia employs more than 5,800 employees in Poland, including 4,500 in the R&D segment.
