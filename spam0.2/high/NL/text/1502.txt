Apple Pay quietly arrives in NL with online bank Bunq  28 CET | News 
Dutch customers of online bank Bunq can now use Apple Pay in the Netherlands. Officially, Apple Pay is still not available in the country, but thanks to a detour, these customers will be able to make use of the mobile payment service. 
Bunq will officially introduce the payment service in Spain and Italy. The only thing Dutch customers of Bunq have to do to use Apple Pay is to adjust the region to one of the two countries. After that, Apple Pay can be used to make contactless payments in all places where a contactless payment point is available. 
With Apple Pay, it is possible to make payments with an Apple iPhone or an Apple Watch. Although Apple already introduced the payment service in 2014, the payment service is still not available in the Netherlands, though it is available in several other European countries.
