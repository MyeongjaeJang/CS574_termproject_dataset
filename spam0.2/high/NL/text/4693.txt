Google plans to open a new digital training centre in the centre of Brussels. The hub will open at the end of April at BeCentral, a digital business centre located above Brussels Central train station, reports La Libre Belgique. 
The digital academy was confirmed by BeCentral, which is working with Google along with the Belgian train service SNCB/NMBS. It aims to welcome within its first year 10,000 people to the digital world through workshops and courses. Google already organises similar sessions around Brussels, which have trained some 40,000 people since 2016. The training will now be based at BeCentral, which already hosts a number of start-ups and initiatives aimed at improving digital awareness and entrepreneurship.
