thyssenkrupps MULTI nominated for Innovation Award Der Deutsche Innovationspreis -MULTI is one of the finalists in the Large Enterprises category -Groundbreaking thyssenkrupp Elevator technology paves the way for tomorrows urban mobility: more efficient, more comfortable, more flexible WEBWIRE – Monday, March 19, 2018 
The MULTI revolution in elevator construction changes the way people move inside buildings, providing completely new perspectives and a whole new world of opportunities for architects, planners, and operators. Thats why the jury of Der Deutsche Innovationspreis nominated MULTI as a candidate for the coveted award. thyssenkrupp is one of just three elite businesses nominated in the category. The official ceremony will take place on April 13th, 2018 in Munich. 
The Deutscher Innovationspreis has been established by the renowned magazine WirtschaftsWoche, in cooperation with the consulting firm Accenture and the energy supplier EnBW. Since 2018, also the car manufacturer Daimler is involved in honoring excellent, future-oriented innovations by German enterprises that are capable of influencing markets. There are three categories: large enterprises, midsized businesses, and start-ups. 
With MULTI, thyssenkrupp has made tomorrows elevator system possible today. Its capabilities and technical characteristics are truly game-changing for not just the industry, but for our future built environment too. By employing linear motors, several cabins can be used in one single shaft at the same time  vertically as well as horizontally. This provides a considerable base reduction compared to a traditional system and unlocks up to 25 percent more usable floor space. There are also nearly no limits in terms of the buildings height, which is a critical factor as ever-taller skyscrapers are being realized. 
Andreas Schierenbeck, CEO of thyssenkrupp Elevator, says: The elevator industry is evolving and innovating to meet the needs of modern society. For us, its like a revolution; the whole industry needs to question ones own experiences and convictions just to try something completely different  and to have trust in that new development. 
It took just three years to bring MULTI from concept to market, using the new thyssenkrupp test tower in Rottweil, Germany. The proven Transrapid technology is also involved. 
The new elevator concept not only heralds an end to the dominance of traditional rope-based elevators but defines the capabilities of an elevator system in a completely new way. Be it vertical or horizontal transport; the passengers profit from much shorter waiting times as well as from a much more comfortable ride, while the operators have much more flexibility - one of the most critical characteristics of tomorrows urban mobility concepts. 
In the past year alone, MULTI has won some prestigious awards  such as Gold at the Edison Awards and the German Design Award , and was selected as one of the Top 25 Inventions 2017 by the TIME Magazine.
