iiNet, Internode to compensate customers for slow NBN speeds Tuesday 20 March 2018 | 06:49 CET | News The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has announced that internet service providers iiNet and Internode have agreed to compensate their customers who were misled about maximum speeds they could achieve on certain NBN plans. iiNet and Internode will compensate more than 11,000 customers who could not reach the internet speeds they were promised in their NBN contracts, following an investigation by the ACCC. 
Remedies will be offered to 8,000 iiNet customers and 3,000 Internode customers. Affected customers can choose from options including moving to a lower tier speed plan with a refund, or exiting their plan without cost and receiving a refund. 
“iiNet and Internode have admitted that between 2015 and mid-2017, they both likely engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct or made false or misleading representations by promoting and offering NBN plans with maximum speeds that could not be delivered”, ACCC Commissioner Sarah Court said. According to the ACCC, iiNet advertised its highest-speed plan as “Up to 100Mbps. This is our fastest option and is sure to impress”, while Internode advertised its highest speed plan as “NBN Platinum: up to 100/40 Mbps”. 
iiNet and Internode have until 27 April to notify affected customers by email or letter. All other residential consumers or small businesses with speed issues relating to a service delivered over the NBN should first contact their service provider.
