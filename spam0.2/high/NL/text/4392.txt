The makers of Rani’s Hichki are promoting the film in a very unique way by having stars share their untold weaknesses and how they eventually converted them into massive strengths. 
In this cool video Salman Khan opened about how he took his work casually. He revealed, “I used to have a Hichki. I used to take my work very casually. Now, that has changed as I take my work with seriousness and sincerity now. Because, now I have realised that nothing is better than work. Kaam se behtar kuch nahi hain. I guess all of you should also take your work seriously and appreciate every day that you are working.” Share this:
