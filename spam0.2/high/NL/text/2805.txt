  Fatal crane incident in Morocco 
The photo does not show what caused the incident 
21. March 2018 
Two men died and another was critically injured yesterday morning when a tower crane collapsed on a building site on the north side of Casablanca, Morocco near the suburb of Ain Seb√¢a. 
Information is sketchy, but it seems that the crane collapsed with the jib falling onto a building under construction, striking the two men who were working on the upper floor. The injured man is the crane operator. 
The only photos that we have received do not given any indication as to what caused the collapse. 
We have been told though the crane, a Jaso, collided with a large generator/electrical installation before it failed, but we have not been able to confirm that. We will update this item if and when we learn more. SOURCE: Vertikal.net Liked this post?
