Only one third of German firms are venturing into IoT Tuesday 20 March 2018 | 13:48 CET | News 
A new study from market research firm IDC has found that only 34 percent of companies in Germany are implementing initiatives or are in the pilot phase of projects for the Internet of Things (IoT), reported Heise Online. The survey found that the insurance and finance industries were the furthest along in IoT projects, with 45 percent of businesses in those sectors undertaking an IoT project. Firms in public administration (28 percent) and the health care industry (23 percent) meanwhile had done the least work with IoT, found the IDC. 
Still, nearly three quarters of firms polled said they had planned to undertake and set aside a budget for a new IoT project this year, while 51 percent of companies said that they wanted to set up an IoT platform to manage applications and networked devices, and to process data. 
The IDC survey questioned 444 firms with over 100 employees in eight different industries on their implementation plans, challenges and success factors with the IoT. One quarter of businesses questioned complained about the high complexity of IoT and diversity of providers in the industry as hindrances to implementing projects, with 20 percent of firms saying they would prefer to use an "all-around care package" from providers for IoT applications.
