Airtel Tanzania and the Vocational Educational and Training Authority (VETA) have launched a new system of school fees payment for the students registering for vocational courses through the VSOMO App, reports the Daily news. It aims to increase the number of students on the e-Learning programme run by Airtel and VETA. Under the new system, students can pay a deposit of TZS 60,000 and then pay the rest before the start of practical sessions, instead of having to pay the full amount of TZS 120,000 upon registration. 
Airtel Tanzania's director of communications, Beatrice Singano Mallya, said that since the launch of VSOMO programme two years ago, a high number of people has been registering for the scheme. The VSOMO App has been a success since its launch so Airtel and VETA decided to come with the new payment structure, she said.
