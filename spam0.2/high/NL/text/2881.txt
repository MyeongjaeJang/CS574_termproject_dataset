On March 16, activists packed the meeting room at the Albuquerque Center for Peace and Justice in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to mark the fourth anniversary of the police murder of James Boyd.
Activist and author Prof. David Correia launched a book on police violence that he co-authored, Police: A Field Guide . It is a "field guide" for anti-police terror activists. This book is a much welcome contribution to the movement, and an essential tool for every activist. ANSWER New Mexico mobilized for the event and ANSWER organizer Paige Murphy was a speaker on the panel.
