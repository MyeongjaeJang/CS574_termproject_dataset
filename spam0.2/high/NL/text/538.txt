Revenues at Scania grew to 12.8 billion corresponding to an impressive growth rate of 13.2%. Scanias operating profit saw an even stronger increase reaching 1.3 billion.

In Russia, unit sales more than doubled to 11,300 vehicles (+130.6%), influenced by the Russian market due to falling inflation rates, demand for replacement vehicles, and signs of recovery shown by the countrys economy. Sales in South America increased by 28.5% to 34,620 vehicles, which was among others driven by the Groups position as market leader in the Brazilian truck business.

In the Middle East, unit sales went up 15.5% to 11,580 vehicles.
