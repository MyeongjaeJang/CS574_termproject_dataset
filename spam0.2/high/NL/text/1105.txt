Digical given 50-year fibre-optic licence in TCI Tuesday 20 March 2018 | 14:09 CET | News 
Digicel has been awarded a 50-year licence to roll out underground fibre-optic cables throughout the Turks & Caicos Islands (TCI), reports local portal RJR News, citing the company’s marketing executive Romello Williams. The company will now be able to install cables along specified blocks of Crown land in Providenciales and Grand Turk as part of its project to fix and improve its telecommunications infrastructure following significant damage caused by hurricanes Irma and Maria. The aim is to bury the core of Digicel’s network with a view to future proofing it against natural disasters, said Williams. The group last month announced a USD 15 million investment to repair and upgrade its telecommunications infrastructure in the TCI, Dominica, British Virgin Islands and Anguilla.
