Huawei, Salam Technology provide CCTV storage for Hamad International Airport   10:45 CET | News 
Huawei and Salam Technology have been awarded a high capacity CCTV Storage project for the Hamad International Airport (HIA). Huawei has provided 10 Petabytes (PB) of storage with a five-fold scalability option for the next five years. 
HIA's passenger terminal covers 600,000 square meters and the airport itself covers 22 square kilometres. In 2016, HIA accomplished a record in passenger traffic and aircraft movements, handling 37.3 million passengers and 245,800 landings and take-offs. HIA is gearing up to welcome more than 50 million passengers by 2022. This means HIA had a substantial storage requirement for the next five years. This needed to be scalable up to 50 PB with high bandwidth capacity and the ability to meet 99.999 percent availability. 
To meet these requirements, Huawei provided CCTV storage using the OceanStor 9000 product for shared storage with good performance, open interfaces, simple system management and maintenance, and above all large scale expansion capabilities. 
Despite competition, Huawei won the trust of HIA through this future-proof highly scalable storage system. HIA will have a cost-effective service with the industry's highest capacity disks ever, ensuring highly available, robust and secure operations at lower TCO (total cost of ownership). 
HIA has been classified as a five-star airport by Skytrax, making it one among only five other airports in the world to achieve this status. It was recently ranked Fifth Best Airport in the World by the 2018 Skytrax World Airport Awards.
