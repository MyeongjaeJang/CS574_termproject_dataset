  Video: Installation 1,600mt Leg Encircling Crane Aeolus - Van Oord 
19 March 2018 
On Wednesday 28 February, the 1,600mt Huisman Leg Encircling Crane for Van Oord was successfully installed on board their offshore installation vessel Aeolus https://www.vanoord.com/activities/of... . 
The new crane, the biggest Leg Encircling Crane ever built, will enable Van Oord to install bigger and heavier foundations and turbines for offshore wind farms. The Huisman crane was installed by Heeremaâ€™s Thialf, making it a pretty spectacular sight!
