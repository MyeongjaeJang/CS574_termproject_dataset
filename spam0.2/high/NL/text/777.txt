Idemia partners Unisys to provide biometric services for Home Affairs Department in Australia Monday 19 March 2018 | 20:37 CET | News 
Augmented identity specialist Idemia will provide a biometric matching engine platform for the Australian Department of Home Affairs (Home Affairs). The platform is powering the institution's Biometric Identity Service (EBIS). The Idemia team will implement a flagship system working with prime contractor Unisys, who will provide the overall system integration as well as the biometric management and processing platform Unisys Stealth. 
At the heart of the system is Idemia’s MorphoBSS multi-biometric engine, making use of face and fingerprint matching algorithms and providing capability for the addition of other modalities if the need arises such as iris recognition. MorphoBSS is a flagship product of Idemia, combining very high scalability (over 1 billion identities possible), very high availability – designed for mission-critical systems, and integrating Idemia’S biometric algorithms. Joining forces with Unisys’s Stealth (identity), also a highly scalable Identity management engine, the platform will provide a flexible capability that can integrate into the Home Affairs’ wider ecosystem. 
As part of the deployment of EBIS, Idemia will engage its global biometrics research capability in addition to local personnel from both Unisys and Idemia.
