NCC sends letter to central bank with rules for 9mobile sale Wednesday 21 March 2018 | 09:53 CET | News 
Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) says it has laid down rules of engagement that will ensure the transparent sale of 9mobile and the sustenance of its business after its sale, reports The Nation. The rules are set out in a letter addressed to the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Godwin Emefiele. The NCC letter, according to Smile Communication, was endorsed by the NCC board chairman, Senator Olabiyi Durojaiye. 
It recognises that 9mobile is indebted to a consortium of banks that are regulated by the CBN. Both NCC and CBN have been collaborating to ensure the successful sale of 9mobile. The letter identified three criteria to guide the emergence of a preferred bidder for 9mobile. The first is that the company must have the technical competence apart from financial capability to turn 9mobile around and not compound its problems. 
The second is that the successful bidder should bring in substantial funds (foreign exchange) to sustain it, not just recycle funding facilities already within the economy. Teleology Holdings, as a special purpose vehicle for the acquisition of 9mobile, has no apparent infrastructure on ground. Unlike its rival Smile Telecoms, which operates in key Nigerian cities and was announced as the reserve bidder, Teleology Holdings is neither operational nor has experience in Nigeria, said The Nation.
