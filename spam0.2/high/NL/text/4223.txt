Siemens and Atos reinforce their strategic cooperation March 26, 2018 by Anna 
Siemens and Atos are reinforcing their strategic co-operation, with plans to accelerate their joint business until 2020 through an ambitious joint go-to-market plan and the strengthening of their joint innovation and investment program. 
The program has been increased by €100 million, totaling €330 million – more than three times the original sum. This will further support the Siemens and Atos IoT MindSphere-Codex strategic co-operation as well as the joint go-to-market. 
The program aims to enhance Siemens and Atos’ digital strategy and develop joint capabilities in Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, advanced IoT & connectivity services, cyber security and digital service technologies to support the digital transformation of their customers through an end-to-end IoT suite. 
Since the start of the partnership in 2011, Siemens and Atos have achieved a joint order intake of €2.5 billion. 
As part of this partnership, Siemens contributed its IT solutions and services business to Atos in exchange for around 12.5 million Atos shares. The deal created a new European IT champion for systems integration, application management, cloud computing, with IT solutions for industry software, mobility, building technologies, smart power grids and other IT services.
