Megafon, NEC test AI for network maintenance Monday 26 March 2018 | 15:43 CET | News 
Russian mobile operator Megafon has completed tests of AI for planning and maintenance of transport network resources. AI technology field tests in MegaFon's network were carried out in order to improve the efficiency of planning and maintenance of backbone network resources. The tests were conducted in Megafon Urals network from October to November 2017, where NEC's AI algorithms carried out analysis of 150 radio links considered the most critical from a network construction standpoint. During the verification tests, NEC and Megafon jointly confirmed the effectiveness of the two key features, Demand Forecast and Preventive Maintenance, using NEC's AI technologies, NEC the Wise. Demand Forecast enables timely planning of backbone network resources through accurate prediction of network traffic. During the tests, this service boasted an accuracy of over 97 percent for traffic prediction against actual traffic. This enables more efficient planning of transport network capacity expansion and helps to reduce expenses for unnecessary infrastructure, while also reducing losses from untimely procurement of equipment. 
The Preventive Maintenance feature provides optimal maintenance schedules according to packet loss prediction. The feature can predict packet loss figures several months in advance for each network device and identifies those that are likely to cause disruptions in services. By leveraging this service, Megafon will be able to prioritize the maintenance of potentially faulty devices.
