Great Expectations for Space Application - the Next Generation Power Device, "X-GaN" Tsukuba, Japan – WEBWIRE – Friday, March 23, 2018 
Panasonics next generation chemical compound semi-conductor, GaN power transistor X-GaN(TM) realizes significant space and energy savings for a wide range of electronic components. Panasonic began mass production of these power devices in November 2016, and JAXA, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, which plays a central role in Japans space development, has high expectations for these power devices. This video introduces how the X-GaN(TM) is being developed with space application in mind, as well as comments from researchers involved in the R&D. 
At the Tsukuba Space Center located in Tsukuba City, Ibaraki Prefecture, research and development of rockets and satellites as well as their underlying technologies are underway. Research Unit 1 is in charge of developing navigation guidance control, telecommunication systems, space power systems, and electronic devices, and is looking at potentially using Panasonics X-GaN(TM) in its development of space technologies, and has already begun evaluation    X-GaN(TM) . Mr. Eiichi Mizuta, a member of the Research Unit 1, who is specifically in charge of electronic devices, said, Space is an extremely harsh environment. In particular, space radiation can cause damage to electronic devices, so we need to have countermeasures. 
Majority of the semiconductors used in space are made of silicon. But there is a limit as to how much radiation they can withstand, so there was a need for superior devices. We performed radiation tests with Panasonic X-GaN(TM) using Xenon Ions, which we often use for space evaluation. These tests proved that the X-GaN(TM) is highly resistant to radiation. It is rare for a commercial-off-the-shelf device to be so robust against radiation, so we were really surprised added Mr. Mizuta. 
Moreover, Mr. Mizuta also stated that X-GaN(TM) devices enable faster switching. When applied to satellites, they can help reduce payload mass, which makes them very attractive since satellites have strict payload mass limitations. Because GaN devices help save weight and thereby allows the weight to be used for other high performance components, they are very effective for our space development. 
Mr. Mizuta also expressed his expectations for Panasonic. Panasonics X-GaN(TM) has a high potential to become the next generation space component. We hope to continue to work closely with Panasonic to develop even better devices for space.
