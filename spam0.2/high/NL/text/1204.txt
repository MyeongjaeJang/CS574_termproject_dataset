Designed to be displayed as statement pieces in contemporary interior settings, Premier Housewares ’ new line of large sofas feature fabric and leather upholstery, and display on-trend finishing touches. 
Presented as part of Premier Housewares’ new Fifty Five South brand – a premium collection of furniture, lighting and accessories, characterised by limited edition objects, an artisanal approach, and the use of a diverse range of materials – the new sofa collection has been developed to co-ordinate with a wide range of interior design trends. 
It includes Nordic pieces dressed with tactile fabric upholstery, supple leather sofas in a range of colours with deep button tufting, and large corner couches. 
New designs arrive on a regular basis. Pieces to look out for include the mid-century-inspired Rena, an expansive three-seat sofa upholstered with button-tufted grey velvet, and cradled in a reflective silver metal frame. 
Every sofa can be viewed in Premier Housewares’ Glasgow showroom, a modern 30,000 sqft facility arranged over two floors, in which the sofas are presented alongside lighting and living accessories on the second floor.
