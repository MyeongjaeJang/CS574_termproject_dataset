Coimbatore : A petrol bomb was hurled at the house of BJP district president CR Nandakumar in the early hours of today. The front part and engine of a SUV parked in front of the house in Singanallur area was totally burnt, police said. 
The incident happened around 3 am, Nandakumar said. Senior party leaders, including State president Tamilisai Soundararajan, were expected to visit the house, he said. Meanwhile, police were monitoring CCTV footage from the cameras installed around the area to identify the miscreants. A large number of police has been deployed in the area. 
Though police did not attribute any reason to the incident, it was suspected that this could be a warning for the VHP Rathyatra entering TamilNadu or vandalising statues of many leaders, including Periyar. It may be recalled two pertol bombs were hurled at the house of Hindu Munnani leader Umapathi in Selvapuram some time ago. ALSO READ
