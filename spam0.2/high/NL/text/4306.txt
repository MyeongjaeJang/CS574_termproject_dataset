Inexio sees double-digit FY revenue, EBITDA growth Monday 26 March 2018 | 14:51 CET | News 
German regional network operator Inexio reported a significant increase in annual revenues and EBITDA. The Saarlouis-based company said revenues climbed 24.5 percent in its tenth year of business to EUR 65 million, up from EUR 52.2 million the previous year. EBITDA meanwhile increased 16 percent to EUR 24.8 million. Inexio said all of its business areas continued to grow last year and that it served 80,000 private households and 4,500 business customers with high-speed internet and telephony connections as of 30 September 2017, up from 65,000 private customers one year earlier. 
The company’s service area now encompasses over 253,000 households thanks to its gradual expansion and entry into new service areas. Inexio said the entry of private equity firm Warburg Pincus as well as changes made to the company’s business structure have enabled Inexio to react more quickly to the demands of capital markets and identify takeover targets like Komnexx and smartDSL more easily. Inexio’s acquisition of EUR 312.5 million in financing via a bank consortium in 2017 has also helped secure growth for the next five years, reduce refinancing costs and streamline processes, it said. 
The first quarter of the new business year has likewise shown double-digit revenue growth, and Inexio said it expects this trend to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year to 30 September 2018. The company said building capacities could be the only possible factor limiting Inexio’s growth over the next few years.
