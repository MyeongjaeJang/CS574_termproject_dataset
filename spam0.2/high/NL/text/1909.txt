Japan Coast Guard expands unmanned Wave Glider fleet March 20, 2018 by Anna 
The Japan Coast Guard (JCG) has expanded its unmanned ocean observation fleet of Wave Gliders to the 9th Regional District, headquartered in Niigata, Japan, the fifth regional district to use them. 
This unmanned ocean observation network provides real-time situational awareness of ocean currents, wave activity, and weather along Japan’s coastlines, and JCG publishes the environmental data free and in real-time to Japan’s commercial fisheries and tourism industries. 
Wave Gliders, from Liquid Robotics , are environmentally safe and a more effective way to expand national ocean observation systems when compared to traditional methods such as ships, claims the company. 
By utilizing a network of unmanned systems, JCG is able to provide access to continuous, real-time meteorological and oceanographic information from seas where monitoring ships often cannot operate and without putting personnel at risk.
