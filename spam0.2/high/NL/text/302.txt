3 Sweden brings out new subscription range with choice of whether or not to commit   13:34 CET | News 
3 Sweden said it is bringing out a new range of subscriptions, with options for more data, and lower prices for customers who commit themselves for a certain period. Tre CEO Johan Johansson said the new services aim to challenge the sector by fulfilling customer requirements. It intends to offer the best value for money in terms of handsets coupled with a service subscription. 
The new subscriptions are part of its efforts to improve customer satisfaction. It said there is increased demand for mobile services without a handset, and for more flexibility when it comes to contract length. 
Customers can choose to have a twelve or 24-month commitment period, or none at all. Customers selecting a handset as well, must sign up for two years. Mobile internet allowances range from 2 GB to unlimited services. The subscriptions include music streaming, VoWiFi and 3Skicka Surf data sharing. 
As an example, the unlimited 3Surfa subscription providing unrestricted voice calls, SMS, MMS and internet within Sweden, as well as 60 GB for EU surfing, costs SEK 699 per month with no tie-in period. With contracts of one year or 24 months, it costs SEK 599 a month. 
At the other end of the range, the 2 GB monthly 3Surfa subscription provides 100 voice call minutes, texts and MMS, as well as 2 GB for use in Sweden and the EU, for SEK 179 per month with no contract. On twelve or 24-month contracts, the price is SEK 149 monthly. 
Other subscription packages are for 50 GB, 25 GB, 10 GB and 5 GB. 
Customers on existing contracts will not be affected.
