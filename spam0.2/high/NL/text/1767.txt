Share on: google + “Black is a colour associated with elegance, power and authority whilst also surrounded by a certain air of mystery.” Those are the words of McLaren design director, Rob Melville, said of this new blacked out MSO 570GT from the iconic car manufacturer. Known for being as fast as anyone out there, McLaren has set out to be the most elegant too with this one, producing a limited edition black on black on black version of one of the finest cars in their collection. Perfected by the McLaren Special Operations, the team took an already popular McLaren vehicle and made it even better by adding extra flair. They’re calling this body of work the “Black Collection.” Aside from a custom Carbon Black paint job, this MSO 570GT has been outfitted with a MSO Defined Titanium SuperSports Exhaust, Sport Pack dynamic handling package, MSO Defined Black front and rear splitters, sides skirts and air intakes. Black Brembo brakes are coupled with a set of 5 Twin-Spoke Lightweight Forged Wheels in Gloss Black Diamond Wheel Finish, completed by Pirelli P Zero Corsa tires. The interior is also all blacked-out with the help of Jet Black Leather and Carbon Black Alcantara accents. Retailing for just over a quarter million dollars, only 100 of these cars will hit the roads worldwide, making them a super rare, super speed and super elegant vehicle from McLaren.
