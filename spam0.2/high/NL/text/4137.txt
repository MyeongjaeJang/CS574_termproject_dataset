TF1 and M6 seek to overturn decision easing Canal Plus regulatory obligations Monday 26 March 2018 | 10:57 CET | News 
Broadcasters TF1 and M6 have initiated proceedings before France's Council of State (Conseil d'Etat) to overturn the rulings published by the countryâ€™s competition watchdog in mid-2017 concerning the regulatory framework under which Canal Plus must operate in the free-to-air and pay-TV markets, reports BFM Business. The competition authority decided to ease several aspects of the obligations originally imposed on Canal Plus in 2006, as a condition to its acquisition of TPS and CanalSatellite. TF1 and M6 are opposing the changes concerning both Canal Plus pay-TV operations and two free-to-air channels (C8 and CStar). 
The move follows a similar action by France Televisions in November 2017, which aimed to overturn the ruling concerning the two free-to-air channels. 
Earlier this month, Canal Plus decided to take TF1 to court after failing to agree new terms for the distribution of TF1's five channels and on-demand services on its platforms. In particular, Canal Plus remains opposed to any payment relating to the distribution of channels available on a free-to-air basis on the national digital TV platform.
