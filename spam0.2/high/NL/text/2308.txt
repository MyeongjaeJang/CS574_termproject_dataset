ICU of Landikotal Hospital converted into immunisation centre March 22, 2018 LANDIKOTAL: The intensive care unit (ICU) of Agency Headquarters Hospital Landikotal, Khyber Agency, has been converted into an immunisation centre. 
Sources in the hospital said the ward was set up with a cost of millions of rupees in 1979 and staff was also provided to it in 1999. However, it has been converted into an immunisation centre now due to lack of necessary equipment. The sources added that cardiology equipment and other necessary items were brought to the Landikotal Hospital from Ghallanai Hospital of Mohmand Agency, but that equipment has been sent back. 
The ICU was inaugurated three times in the past. It was first inaugurated by former governor Mian Gul Orangzeb in 2004, by former Member National Assembly Noorul Haq Qadri in 2005 and by former governor Khalilur Rehman in 2006. 
The sources added that two cardiologists, two medical officers, four nurses, two ECG technicians, two dispensers, two midwives and two watchmen were also appointed for the ICU. 
The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader from Khyber Agency Shahid Shinwari criticised the Health Department and elected representatives and said it tantamount to deceiving the masses. He said where the poor people of the area will go in case of emergency. He said his party will raise voice against this step of the administration.
