Australia data downloads jump 43% in 2017  17 CET | News The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has published its annual report on competition and price changes in the telecommunications sector in the 2016/17 financial year. The report shows that consumers were able to access communications services of growing value as prices fell and plan inclusions increased. The report indicates that data downloads increased by 43 percent over the year, with consumers continuing to rely heavily on fixed broadband connections, which accounted for 92 percent of all downloads. 
The study also found that the real prices for fixed internet services in the market fell by an average 4.5 percent year-on-year from 2014 to 2017. The range of plans and bundles available has changed significantly and a quarter of all fixed broadband plans had an unlimited data allowance, up from 5 percent in 2014. Real prices of mobile services dropped by an average of 7.1 percent each year over the same period, though the price of higher-priced prepaid plans increased in 2017. 
The number of mobile voice minutes rose by 7 billion over the year, more than offsetting the reduction in fixed-line minutes of 3 billion. Mobile handsets are also the preferred way of accessing the internet, accounting for 66 percent of all broadband subscriptions while fixed broadband connections are used far more intensively by businesses and consumers.
