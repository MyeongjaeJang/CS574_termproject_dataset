UN-Habitatâ€™s Global Public Space Programme, launched in 2012, is now active in more than 30 cities across the world. We produce policy guides, share knowledge and carry out advocacy work to promote public space as a key element to ensure good quality of life for all urban residents. The Programme helps cities assess and map their public spaces to prepare city-wide public space strategies and urban development frameworks. In collaboration with local government and civil society partners we demonstrate the importance of public space for achieving social, economic and environmental benefits through more than 50 concrete public space upgrading projects selected through annual expressions of interest. We share good policy and practice on a global level though a network of around 100 partner organisations. Global Public Space Programme Annual report 2017 5.12 MB 4 downloads
