The price of fuel has been increased throughout the territory of the DRC. The liter of petrol has gone from 1810 to 1890 Congolese francs (CF) and that of diesel from 1800 to 1880 FC, said Sunday the Minister of Economy Joseph Kapika. It is therefore a rise of 80 FC of the price of the liter of fuel at the pump. 
Kapika attributes this increase to the increase in the price of a barrel of oil internationally. The price per barrel has increased by more than 50%, he said. 
The barrel of oil is increasing. It has exceeded 50%. It is only natural that we can not suffer the whims of this law of supply and demand. That is to say, readjust our price. If we do not readjust it, we will not be able to import fuel and there will be a shortage, “explained the minister. 
However, he insists that this change in the price of fuel at the pump will not affect the price of public transit. 
At the microphone of Radio Okapi Sunday, some owners of the vehicles deplored the fact that this measure of increase in the price of fuel has not been popularized. Many said they heard the news at the gas station. 
“I had planned to pay 5 liters. I besides bickered with the saleswoman. I told him that you stole me. She told me that the price has gone up. I was surprised. We are not even informed. The price of gasoline changes regularly. And the price of the race does not change, “lamented a taxi driver, before calling on the government to also review the price of public transit.   358 times!
