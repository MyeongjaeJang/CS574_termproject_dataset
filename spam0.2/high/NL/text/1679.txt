Vodafone Ukraine pledges almost 30% of assets for credit line   11:00 CET | News 
Mobile operator Vodafone Ukraine plans to pledge assets worth UAH 4.6 billion for a new credit line, reports BizLigaNet. That's almost 30 percent of its assets. 
Before the first tender for LTE spectrum carried out in Ukraine at the end of 2017, the operator agreed UAH 2.97 billion in credit to pay for the LTE licences and new equipment. The pledge was necessary for this credit line, and the difference in sums is related to annual interest. 
The funds will be received from a London-based bank.
