YEI - 22 Mar 2018 Yei River State hospital in need of an ambulance 
An official in the ministry of health and environment in South Sudan’s Yei River state says they are in dire need of an ambulance to handle emergency cases from around the state. 
The ministry’s Director General James Wani told Radio Tamazuj on Wednesday that its only ambulance was involved in a serious accident and is beyond repair. 
Wani said that patients who are not able to afford transportation from remote parts of Yei town, Morobo and Lainya counties are forced to transport patients on bicycles while others use foot to access emergency health care services at the main state referral hospital. 
“The issue of ambulance remains a big challenge at the state hospital. Our only single ambulance had an accident along the Yei-air strip some months ago. At the moment we are left stranded. I am calling on partners and other well wishes to help us on the ground,” he appealed. 
Yei Civil Hospital is the state’s main referral hospital serving patients from greater Morobo, Lainya, Kajo-Keji and Yei River Counties. Share this
