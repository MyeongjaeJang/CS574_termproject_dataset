UK MPs ask Facebook CEO to testify about data breach Wednesday 21 March 2018 | 16:50 CET | News 
The UK's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee has written to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg asking him to appear before the Committee to give oral evidence. This comes after recent reports of a major breach of Facebook users' data involving Cambridge Analytica . 
In the letter , DCMS Chairman Damian Collins MP said that Facebook had consistently understated the risk of user data being used without their consent, and said it was time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with sufficient authority to provide an accurate account of this process. It has asked for a response to the letter by 26 March.
