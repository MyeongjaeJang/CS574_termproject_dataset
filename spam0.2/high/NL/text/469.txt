Silentnight has announced that it plans to open its second flagship showroom with intu, owner of some of the UK’s largest retail and leisure destinations. 
After a successful year following the opening of its first UK standalone showroom at intu Trafford Centre, Silentnight has now signed up to 4800 sqft of space at intu Lakeside. 
Silentnight MD Steve Freeman says: “Silentnight is in the homes of millions of customers, and by opening our second flagship showroom at intu Lakeside, we’re enabling customers in the South-east to explore and experience our full range of beds, mattresses and sleep accessories. 
“This is a great marketing opportunity for us and has so far been really successful at intu Trafford Centre, where we’ve trialled new innovations such as our unique geltex range, which delivers an outstanding sleep experience and an alternative to traditional memory foam. Furthermore, it has also benefited our retail partners who have enjoyed returns from the increased consumer demand and awareness the showroom has created. It enables us to trial new products, new display methods and selling techniques – the results of which we share with all our retail partners, many of whom are now adopting some of the learnings. 
“With its high proportion of female shoppers and loyal customers that regularly visit the centre, intu Lakeside is the perfect location for our new showroom opening offering them the full Silentnight experience.”
