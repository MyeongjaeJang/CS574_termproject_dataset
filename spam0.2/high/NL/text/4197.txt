PTS supervisory report for 2017 finds conditions in place for Telia to follow EOI rules Monday 26 March 2018 | 12:06 CET | News 
Swedish communications regulator PTS has published its report on its supervisory activities in 2017 . It said it established that the necessary conditions were in place for Telia Company to comply with the requirement to give its network leasing customers access on the same terms as it provides its own customers, under the equivalence of input (EOI) rules. 
PTS said price supervision remained a priority, and in particular, the ceiling for mobile voice call termination and Telia’s copper access prices. During 2017, the watchdog also carried out economic replicability tests for Telia’s fibre access prices, ensuring that fibre leasing customers could compete with the company. 
The regulator said it completed its scrutiny of Telenor Sweden’s implementation of EU roam like at home (RLAH) rules but is still monitoring 3 Sweden. Another feature of last year’s regulatory work was checking that operators are following the net neutrality principle. It ordered Telia to stop traffic management , and this matter was referred to the Administrative Court for an appeal. 
Another matter was ensuring that five municipal grids were following regulations on providing information on broadband expansion plans, such as to the network mapping service Ledningskollen. 
PTS began scrutinising Telia’s procedures for dealing with access to its infrastructure. All the monitoring cases regarding broadband expansion are continuing. Free Headlines in your E-mail
