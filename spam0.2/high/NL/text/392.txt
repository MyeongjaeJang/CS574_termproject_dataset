Italian tax court dismisses Telit appeal against EUR 5 mln fine Monday 19 March 2018 | 10:09 CET | News 
Telit Italia, the local subsidiary of M2M specialist Telit Communications, has announced that the first level tax court in Italy has dismissed appeals filed by Telit against fines issued back in August 2015. The company said it intends to appeal the latest decision and to vigorously defend its position, adding that the total value of the fines comes to around EUR 5 million, as set out in the group's annual report for the year ending 31 December 2016. Two tiers of lower level tax courts previously found in favour of Telit Italiaâ€™s appeals against three VAT assessments raised against the unit. However, the matter remains open before the Italian Supreme Court and Telit does not expect it to be heard before 2022. Free Headlines in your E-mail
