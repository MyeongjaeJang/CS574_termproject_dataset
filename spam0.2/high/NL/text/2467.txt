Com Hem AGM clears higher dividend, capital cut then increase, ahead of Tele2 merger   13:03 CET | News 
Swedish fixed line operator Com Hem said that shareholders at its final AGM before it merges with Tele2 Sweden duly passed the motions to pay a SEK 6.00 dividend for 2017, and to reduce and then increase its share capital. 
The dividend is 50 percent higher than one that Com Hem paid for 2016, after net profit for 2017 rose by 45 percent. The company will cut its capital by some SEK 4.89 million by cancelling 4.30 million shares. It will then raise the capital again by the same sum (SEK 4.89 mln) through a bonus issue, with the amount being transferred from equity, without an issuance of new shares. 
Com Hem and Tele2 are expected to hold extraordinary general meetings in the second half of 2018 to vote on their merger. Com Hem shareholders will end up with just under 27 percent of the enlarged Tele2 and with a total cash consideration of SEK 6.6 billion.
