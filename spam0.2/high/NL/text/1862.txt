To remind, private-equity backed Neptune Energy in February this year completed the acquisition of Engie E&P International (EPI) from the French energy group, Engie. 
Engie had received an offer from Neptune for the stake in its oil and gas exploration and production business, Engie E&P, in May 2017. 
Neptune, an investment firm established in 2015 by an ex-Centrica boss Sam Laidlaw, offered to buy Engie’s 70% interest in EPI for an aggregate value of €4.7 billion (at 100%, including €1.1 billion in decommissioning liabilities deconsolidated from Engie’s balance sheet). 
Neptune announced the close of the transaction on Thursday, February 15, 2018. The transaction saw Neptune become an international independent E&P company across the North Sea, North Africa and South East Asia, producing 154,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017.
