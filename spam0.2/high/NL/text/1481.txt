Samsung adds services for IoT, fingerprint scanning to foundry portfolio   08:12 CET | News Samsung has added services specialized for the IoT and fingerprint scanning in its foundry portfolio. Samsung's foundry business focuses on making chips for other companies that do not have a semiconductor plant. Samsung said it started shipping IoT and fingerprint sensor chips to clients, produced from 200-millimeter or 8-inch wafers, Yonhap news agency reports. "On top of its existing eFlash, Power, display driver IC and CMOS image sensor offerings, RF/IoT and fingerprint technology solutions are now available through Samsung's foundry services", the company said. By expanding its offering into the RF/IoT and fingerprint segments, Samsung plans to enable its customers to use Samsung's 8-inch services for a broader range of applications.
