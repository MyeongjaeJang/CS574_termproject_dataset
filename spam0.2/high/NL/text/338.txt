On Monday morning the police arrested a man who was behaving suspiciously at kosher restaurant Ha Carmel on Amstelveenseweg in Amsterdam. Video footage shows the man screaming in front of the restaurant, NU.nl reports. 
The man was arrested in the vicinity of the restaurant. Nothing can yet be said about his identity or why he was screaming at the restaurant, a police spokesperson said to the newspaper. The area around the business was closed down for investigation. As yet no damage to the building has been discovered. "We take the case seriously", the police said. 
The restaurant was regularly targeted over the past months. In December a man was arrested after he broke the restaurant's windows. In January someone smeared the windows with a mixture of eggs and mayonnaise. And earlier this month another window was smashed. 
After the incident earlier this month, Mayor Jozias van Aartsen decided to install surveillance cameras around the restaurant. Tags:
