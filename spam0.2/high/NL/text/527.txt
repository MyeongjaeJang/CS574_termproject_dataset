Yesterday was the third day of racing at the world’s most prestigious regatta in St Barths as the 23-strong superyacht fleet set off on a 22-25 nm course littered with several natural turning marks on the western side of the Caribbean island. Sailing in a separate fleet, yesterday was also the fourth of five races for the J Class sailors. Below are a recap of the day’s results.
