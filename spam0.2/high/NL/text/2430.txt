Today, almost all home buyers and sellers begin their search for a real estate agent online. In fact, statistics show that buyers and sellers consider their options for about three months before committing to an agent. Buyers consistently browse the internet for homes for sale. Sometimes buyers use as many as eight different sites for their searches. In fact, statistics show that home buyers look for approximately three months before contacting a Realtor for assistance, says The Results Group co-founder Alan Sarrail. Our number one priority has always been to simplify home buying and selling process. Our new home search on our website does just that. 
At KWResultsGroup.com/search we have integrated our home search engine with the Southern California Multiple Listing Service. This provides our clients the most up to date information about property availability. Through your interaction with the site, we can build a buyer profile from what homes you like and dislike. As you search homes on the site, your smart profile grows. As we learn more about you, we can provide a list of homes that meet your criteria that are on and off of the market. As homes become available, you will be the first to know. Beyond having a Smart Search, the site is set up for you to communicate with your agent right from the platform. You can request more information on a particular home or request an appointment to see the house. Anytime communication is sent from the site it connects you with the agent and staff directly. Our website Smart Search allows you to get a response right away. 
When we realized the amount of time a consumer spends before reaching out to an agent, we knew we had to close this gap. The smart search allows consumers to get to see an agent before contacting them, adds Sarrail. The focus of this search platform is on the experience for the buyer. Throughout the search process and interaction, agents give advice to buyers, discuss the various areas they specialize in and talk about their experience and backgrounds. An online search without interaction is what most real estate companies offer. The Results Group home search takes it to the next level and helps buyers make a more informed decision, from the comfort of their own home. 
Our commitment to our clients is to consistently improve the home buying experience through the use of technology. This is not a vague concept; it delivers specific benefits to The Results Groups clients and the agents who serve them. With the real estate market continually reinventing itself, this of experience is a substantial asset and will be consistently evolving. 
The Results Group are currently with several Real Estate service organizations, including the National Association of Realtors and the Boards of Real Estate. The Results Group takes great pride in the superior service that is provided for every real estate deal. Call (909) 345-0909 today to learn about Redlands homes for sale and Yucaipa homes for sale .
