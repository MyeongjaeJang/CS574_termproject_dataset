Central Londonâ€™s W Hotel Launches Vegan Menu livekindly.co 
One of central London's most luxurious hotels, the W Hotel London , is introducing a new vegan menu. 
Developed through a partnership with Ravinder Bhogal, owner of Jikoni - one of the east end's most prestigious restaurants, the hotel's new vegan selection is currently set to be served at its Perception Bar until the end June. 
Born in Kenya to Indian parents, but brought up in London, Bhogal takes her cooking inspiration from her heritage . Asian mushroom ragout, caramel tofu, besan fritters with coconut yoghurt and curry leaf, as well as lemongrass and lime leaf sorbet are just some of the plant-based delights Bhogal has chosen to feature on the new menu.
