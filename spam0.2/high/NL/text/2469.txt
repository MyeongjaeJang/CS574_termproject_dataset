Telenor, Canal Digital offer latest Norwegian films from streaming service Nettkino   12:39 CET | News 
Telenor Norway said that the T-We television receiver provided by it and its Canal Digital Kabel unit will now supply access to Nettkino, a streaming service developed by a selection of Norwegian cinemas. Telenor said this will make Norwegian feature films available as soon as they are released in cinemas. Birgit Bjornsen, head of TV and broadband at Telenor Norge and Canal Digital Kabel, said the company wants to provide viewers with legal access to a variety of Norwegian productions. 
Elisabeth Sjaastad, project leader at Nettkino, said the deal with Telenor will open up its content to 546,000 TV viewers. Canal Digital Kabel is the only Norwegian TV provider to show the service on decoders during the filmsâ€™ three-month cinema distribution window. 
The film price is the same as a cinema ticket costs, but the whole family can watch at the same time. To start with, T-We will show films that have only a short cinema release time, or that are not being shown everywhere. The very first film to come out will be the family film 'Los Bando', a road trip movie concerning a band trying to reach the National Championship of Rock before their parents and the police stop them. 
Nettkino receives support from the Norwegian Ministry of Culture and from the EU's Creative Europe project.
