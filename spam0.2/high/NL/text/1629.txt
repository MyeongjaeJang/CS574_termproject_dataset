The upcoming film will be directed Alma Har’el and will be based around LaBeouf in his teen years living in LA with his father, a former-clown and heroin addict. Fans of LaBeouf can also look forward to seeing his early career years reflected on film– chronicling his time as a stand-up comedian and actor in the Disney Channel series Even Stevens . The film’s title is taken from a nickname given to him by his father. 
News on the grapevine is LaBeouf started working on the script for the film during a therapy session and is now bringing it to fruition. The script is co-written by Otis Lort, who LaBeouf recently revealed to Esquire is one of his own creative alter egos. 
Young Shia will be played by Lucas Hedges– who won an Oscar for his role in Manchester By The Sea and made appearances in the Golden Globe-winning film, Lady Bird. A release date for the film has yet to be confirmed. In the meantime, we can look forward to seeing Shia on film once again beginning April 13 when his tennis flick Borg vs McEnroe, debuts.
