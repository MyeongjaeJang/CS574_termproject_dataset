Echoes ​ is conceived as a confrontation between life and death. Her installation at the gallery has transformed the space into part temple, part laboratory for the industrial production of an elixir for eternal life. The Late at Tate event will explore underlying themes in Humeaus work such as the Ancient Egyptians relationship with mortality and the parallels that exists in contemporary society where we attempt to preserve life through digital formats. Artist Susi Disorder will also look at the erosion of digital identity over time through the fossilisation of data when it is transferred. 
​A Vaporwave showreel curated by Tate Collective London will explore the microgenre of electronic music and the internet meme culture that emerged in the early 2010s. Reprezent are the resident DJs for Late at Tate 2018 and will take over the 1840s room and the Djanogly Café.
