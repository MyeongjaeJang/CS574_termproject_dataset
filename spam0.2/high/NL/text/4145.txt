Dutch court to hear consumer case against Samsung over handset updates   10:48 CET | News 
A Dutch court will start hearing on 26 March the consumers union's case against Samsung for failure to update regularly Android smartphones. The union is campaigning for handset makers to guarantee software updates for at least two years after purchase. Its research has found most do not meet this standard. 
Samsung's current policy is to update a phone for two years after its market launch. However, the Consumentenbond points out that many phones are on the market much longer and purchased only two years after introduction. These consumers should still benefit from OS and security updates. 
Samsung said its policy of two years of updates after launch is only a 'guideline' and some models do receive updates longer. Many of its high-end models, such as the Galaxy S range, receive updates longer. For example the Galaxy S6 from 2015, S5 from 2014 and S4 from 2013 were still being updated in 2017. 
The consumers union is expected to point to Apple, which keeps its iPhone models up to date for 4-5 years after introduction. However, this is easier for Apple, as it has all the software in house, whereas Android manufacturers rely on Google for the OS. 
Samsung may also point to limitations in some models, making it difficult to continue updates, such as low storage or memory capacity. The processing power can also impact whether a phone can upgrade to a new version of the OS. However, the consumers union has claimed that a lack of OS updates could expose users to more security risks, so manufacturers should at least offer security patches.
