Written by Andrew McDonald 4 hours ago The BBC has announced plans to stream 1,000 extra hours of live sport per year via connected devices such as TVs, mobile phones and tablets. The UK public broadcaster said it has already streamed more than 26 additional sports or sports events through BBC Sport online and the iPlayer – including early rounds of the FA Cup, British Basketball League, Women’s Super League football and wheelchair rugby. The BBC will also collaborate with UK Sport to stream more events from the Olympics and Paralympics and plans to relaunch the BBC Sport connected TV app later this year. “We’re giving people more of what they love by working in partnership with the sports industry and making the most of digital technology,” said BBC director general, Tony Hall. “This shows how we’re reinventing the BBC for a new generation.” Barbara Slater, head of BBC Sport, said: “We’ve seen the nation get behind a whole host of sports in recent years, especially at major events. We want to use BBC Sport’s live streaming service to showcase more of those moments that inspire people to take part.”
