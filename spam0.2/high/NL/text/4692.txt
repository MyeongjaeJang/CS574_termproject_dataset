Italy's Linkem, Go Internet reach frequency sharing deal on 3.5GHz band   10:00 CET | News 
Italian wireless broadband provider Linkem and regional operator Go Internet have reached an agreement to share spectrum in the 3.5 Ghz band with a view to boosting LTE and LTE-A connections in the central Marche and Emilia Romagna regions and eventually rolling out 5G services. In a joint statement, the companies also announced that Linkem had agreed to invest EUR 4 million for a 21 percent stake in Go Internet. The investment deal is subject to approval by Go Internetâ€™s board while the spectrum sharing agreement will have to be approved by the competent authorities, said the partners. Earlier this year, the European Investment Bank agreed to loan EUR 60 million to Linkem to support its migration from Wimax to LTE TDD technology and to expand its coverage of Italian households from 45 percent at the end of 2015 to at least 70 percent by the end of 2018. Both Linkem and Go Internet recently requested a 6-year extension to their licences to use frequencies in the 3.4-3.6 GHz range.
