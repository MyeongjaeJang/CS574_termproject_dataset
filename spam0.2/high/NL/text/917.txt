'Mexico Conectado' project reaches 20 mln users a month  21 CET | News 
The Mexico Conectado national connectivity initiative currently offers free broadband access to 20 million unique users a month via 101,000 sites, reports business portal Dinero en Imagen, citing Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) information society coordinator Javier Lizarraga. The ministry has now signed a contract with state-run operator Telecomm to expand the service via Ka-band satellite capacity, increasing the download speed in 12,500 sites to 6Mbps, revealed the official. Mexico Conectado provides free internet access in public spaces such as schools, health centres, libraries, community centres, public parks and government buildings. The number of public sites nationwide providing free broadband access has been substantially reduced from the initial target of 250,000 in 2018 due to substantial budget cuts .
