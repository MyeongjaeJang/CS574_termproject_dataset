Gus Bontzos, Peraton president Defense and Electronic Warfare sector said, “Detecting, locating, removing or neutralizing unexploded ordnance that threaten our forces and innocent civilians is a critical DOD and humanitarian mission, and it is an honor to be a part of it.” 
“Unfortunately, armed conflicts continue around the world, and so does the proliferation of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), landmines and other unexploded ordnance. It is our job to help our military do this work more safely and efficiently, and ultimately help make former conflict areas safe for people to live, work and travel,” he said. 
The EOD Program Management Office provides the systems, tools and equipment EOD technicians need to locate, identify and neutralize unexploded ground and underwater ordnance, including sea mines, IEDs and other devices. Source: Peraton
