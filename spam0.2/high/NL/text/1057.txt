TRA opens centre to monitor mobile network coverage Tuesday 20 March 2018 | 14:16 CET | News 
The UAE's Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) has officially launched a Coverage Centre that detects the quality of mobile network coverage in the UAE. The centre provides a field survey to test, measure and analyse the quality of mobile grids in the UAE and simulate user service. 
The smart system is being installed in specially designed vehicles, as well as smart devices for interior areas. After a survey is completed, the system transmits data that has been collected automatically and displays it in a monitoring room that TRA has constructed expressly for this purpose. In this coverage room, data from networks' are assessed and any problems are followed up to resolve them as soon as possible in coordination with operators. Network performance reports will be issued and shared with service providers periodically to identify, develop network performance issues and improve services.
