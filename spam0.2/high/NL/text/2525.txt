Apple blocks Apple Pay for Dutch Bunq customers Thursday 22 March 2018 | 11:05 CET | News 
Online bank Bunq was the first bank in the Netherlands to offer Apple Pay to its customers. The introduction short-lived however: Apple has blocked the service. 
Apple Pay is officially available in Italy and Spain, two countries where Bunq is also active. Based on the geographical restriction that Apple has imposed on Apple Pay, only Spanish and Italian customers of Bunq could use Apple Pay. Since Bunq is an online bank, the company was able to make Apple Pay available to Dutch customers with a clever trick. Customers has only to set their region as Spain or Italy. 
A report in Het Financieele Dagblad says now that Apple has put a stop to this, in the 24 hours after introduction. It is no longer possible to change the geographical settings to use Apple Pay in the Netherlands. Dutch Bunq customers who did so before 21 March can -for the time being- continue to use Apple Pay, although it is not known if -and how long- they will be able to do so.
