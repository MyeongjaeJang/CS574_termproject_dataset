AMD cuts some Ryzen and Threadripper CPU prices by Email 
Ahead of Pinnacle Ridge launch 
Ahead of the rumored launch of its second-generation Ryzen CPUs next month, AMD has announced a price cut for some of its current Ryzen-desktop and Ryzen Threadripper processors. 
The list includes almost all AMD Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5, Ryzen 7 and Ryzen Threadripper series CPUs, but it is not clear if the price is global as it is currently limited only to some AMD retail/e-tail partners like Amazon, Newegg, Micro Center and Fry's. Spotted by Anandtech.com , Amazon has also applied the same price cut in some other regions like the UK and France, so it is possible that other regional retail/e-tail partners are also involved. 
Price-cuts are all over the place and depend on the actual SKU but top end Ryzen Threadripper 1950X dropped from US $999 to US $869 and the Ryzen Threadripper 1920X dropped from $799 down to $669. The Ryzen Threadripper 1900X, priced at $449 did not get a price cut as it is already positioned between the Threadripper 1920X and the flagship Ryzen 7 1800X, which was slashed from $349, down to $329. 
The rest of the Ryzen 7 series lineup also had a price cut, with Ryzen 7 1700X going for $289 and Ryzen 7 1700 going for $275. The Ryzen 5 1600X was reduced in price from $219 to $198 while the Ryzen 5 1600 remains at $189 and now fits better between the Ryzen 5 1600X and the Ryzen 5 1500X - cut from $174 to $169. The Ryzen 5 1400 fell in price from $169 down to $150. 
Reductions in the Ryzen 3 lineup pushed the 1300X from $129 down to $115, while the Ryzen 3 finally dropped below $100, from $109 down to $94. 
The new Ryzen 5 2400G and Ryzen 3 2200G APUs were not a part of this price cut as these won't directly influence the upcoming Pinnacle Ridge lineup, which should become available on April 19th.
