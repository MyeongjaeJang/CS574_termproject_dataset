DeMarcus Cousins gets a salute for this #Roommates! The former Sacramento Kings center has reached out to the family of Stephon Clark, offering to pay for the entire funeral. 
Clark was sadly shot and killed Sunday by Sacramento police in his own backyard. Cops mistook his iPhone for a gun and fired 20 rounds at him. 
The family had set up a GoFundMe page earlier this week to help cover the costs with a $50,000 goal, which it passed by Friday.
