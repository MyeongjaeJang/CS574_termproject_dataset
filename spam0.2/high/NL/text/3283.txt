Betting Odds released for Stephen McAfee v Colin O’Donovan 2 By Joe O'Neill | on March 23, 2018 | Bookie Batterer Headline News 
On the eve of one of the most-anticipated Irish small hall fights in recent memory, a betting market has been opened with a major bookmaker. 
Stephen McAfee [2(2)-0-1] and Colin O’Donovan [1(1)-1(1)-1] rematch tomorrow over eight rounds for the vacant BUI Celtic super featherweight title in the headline bout of ‘Celtic Clash 5’ at Good Counsel GAA club in Drimnagh, Dublin. 
A repeat of their epic drawn six-rounder in December, fans, pundits, and fellow fighters have found the two hard to split and it is a relatively close spread provided by gambling giant SkyBet. 
The U.K. outfit are currently only offering a straight win market and they have opened with Sallynoggin slugger Stephen McAfee as a 1/2 favourite. (Update 10:30am: McAfee is now 4/7) Widgets Magazine 
Youghal’s O’Donovan then is a 7/4 underdog for the clash. (Update 10:30am: O’Donovan is now 6/4) 
The draw is priced at 12/1 . 
With such a small, relatively, pool of potential bettors, expect these prices to fluctuate quickly and regularly over the next 24 hours. 
While the pair have already fought, their initial bout has thrown up a number of questions which will be answered tomorrow night. 
How much better will O’Donovan be following a full camp? Will McAfee be more prepared for a southpaw opponent this time? With two extra rounds scheduled, who will benefit? 
We can’t wait to find out.
