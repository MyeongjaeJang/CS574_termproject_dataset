It's March and the superyacht season of events is already well and truly underway for 2018, with boats available for viewings all around the world. This week, we step on board the 49.8-metre Benetti superyacht, FB 215, currently listed for sale with Fraser. 
Built by the renowned Italian yard Benetti at their Viareggio shipyard in 1996 and undergoing her most recent, extensive refit in 2016, the 49.8-metre superyacht is a full displacement yacht from Benetti's Golden Bay Series. With a displacement steel hull, aluminium superstructure and teak decks, the Benetti superyacht was built to RINA classification society rules.FB 215 features exterior design by her Italian shipyard and her original interior design was by the Nice-based studio, Zuretti Interior Design, before being replaced with a fresh, contemporary design following her refit.

In addition, a new mast will be installed on her sundeck in the coming months, designed and built by Benetti to give her a fresh and modern look. 
As is evident from the images, the Benetti superyacht is presented to the market in immaculate, turnkey condition, after only ever being used privately by one owner: the ideal purchasing opportunity for her new owner.
