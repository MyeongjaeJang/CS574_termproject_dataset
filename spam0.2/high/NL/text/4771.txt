Uber ordered to take its self-driving cars off the road by Email 
Failed to keep people safe 
After failing to meet an expectation that it would prioritise public safety as it tested its self-driving technology, Uber has been ordered to take its self-driving cars off Arizona roads. 
Governor Doug Ducey of Arizona wrote in a letter sent to Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's chief executive that the death of a pedestrian on March 18 was "an unquestionable failure to comply" with an expectation that Uber would make public safety a priority. Ducey said he was troubled by a video released from the Tempe Police Department that seemed to show that neither the Uber safety driver nor the autonomous vehicle detected the presence of a pedestrian in the road in the moments before the crash. 
According to the New York Times , Uber had already suspended all testing of its cars in Arizona, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and Toronto. 
A spokes Uber said: "We proactively suspended self-driving operations in all cities immediately following the tragic incident last week. We continue to help investigators in any way we can, and we'll keep a dialogue open with the governor's office to address any concerns they have." 
However, the governor's letter is a reversal from what has been an open-arms policy by the state, which resulted in a lack of regulation to lure autonomous vehicle testing - and tech jobs to the State. 
Waymo, the self-driving car company spun out from Google, and General Motors owned Cruise are testing cars in the state.
