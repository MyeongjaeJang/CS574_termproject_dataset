Ciena helps increase connectivity between Moldova, Geant Thursday 22 March 2018 | 19:00 CET | News 
Ciena acted as a partner of the EU-funded Eastern Partnership Connect (EaPConnect) project that increased the connectivity speeds between the Moldovan research and education (R&E) network in Moldova and the pan-European backbone network, Geant. This was possible through the upgrade of a network link between Moldova and Romania's capitals, Chisinau and Bucharest, to 100 Mbps from 50 Mbps. Other project partners included local operator Felix Telecom, the national R&E networks of Moldova and Romania – Renam and RoEduNet. 
The new network link completes the EaPConnect project goal of improving connectivity between all six Eastern Partnership countries and the rest of the Geant community. 
The new Moldova link went live towards the end of February, providing around 50 Moldovan R&E institutes, libraries and universities with improved network connectivity, access to online resources, and opportunities for international collaboration. A new cross-border optical connection provides two 10 Gbps channels – one for direct access to the Geant point of presence in Bucharest and the second for peering with RoEduNet, which increased connectivity between the Moldovan and Romanian R&E communities. 
Cooperation between the Geant community, including the national research and education networks RENAM and RoEduNet, and commercial partners was vital to the successful deployment of this new network link. Testing was completed on 26 February. Free Headlines in your E-mail
