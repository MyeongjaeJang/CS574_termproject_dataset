El Salvador consults on 1900MHz, AWS tender Wednesday 21 March 2018 | 12:07 CET | News 
El Salvador telecommunications watchdog Siget has announced the launch of a public consultation on its long-delayed proposal to award a total of 140MHz of spectrum in the 1900MHz and 1700MHz/2100MHz (AWS) bands. The regulator said it intends to auction 20MHz in the 1900MHz band and 120MHz in the AWS band, with parties given 10 working days to express an interest in taking part in the tender. El Salvador has only awarded 208 MHz of spectrum since 2015, equivalent to just 16 percent of what the ITU recommended at the time. Free Headlines in your E-mail
