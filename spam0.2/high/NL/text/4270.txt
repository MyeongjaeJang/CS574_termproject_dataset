Deutsche Telekom has begun construction work on what it says is the largest FTTH project in Germany to date, in the district of Vorpommern-Ruegen in the state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania. Telekom said it is laying 1,700 kilometers of fibre and setting up over 1,000 fibre-optic power distributors as part of the project to roll out broadband internet with speeds up to 1 Gbps to 40,000 households in the district. The first households will be able to use their high-speed internet connection by the end of 2018, while the entire fibre network should be completed by the third quarter of 2019. Germanyâ€™s federal government as well as the state government of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania are contributing over EUR 28 million in subsidies for this FTTH roll out.
