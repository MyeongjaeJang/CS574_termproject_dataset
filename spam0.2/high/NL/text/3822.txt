A semi truck took the place of a limo for a sick young boy in Nashville this week, transporting him to and from his favorite places as part of the Make-A-Wish foundation. 
8-year-old Devin suffers from rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare pediatric cancer and is a part of the Make-A-Wish Foundation. As part of his special day, the foundation organized an event for him featuring a few of his favorite things – sports and big rigs. 
Devin’s Wednesday began with a visit to the Bridgestone Arena, where he met Nashville’s hockey team the Predators, toured the stadium, received a team jersey, and even signed a “contract” inducting him into the team. The next day, however, is when the real fun started. 
On Thursday afternoon, after Devin was given the opportunity to learn about and ride the equipment at Thompson Machinery, he was picked up by the main event of the evening- a red Freightliner semi tractor. 
The big rig then took Devin for a spin around downtown Nashville, letting him honk the horn and flash the lights as he pleased, eventually bringing the boy back to the Bridgestone arena for a Predators game against the Maple Leafs. 
“We had an idea about what would happen when we came in,” said Devin’s father. 
“But every day Make-A-Wish has surprised us. Every time we were like ‘wait, there’s more!’” 
Make-A-Wish has proven that nothing brings a smile to a boy’s face quite like big trucks.
