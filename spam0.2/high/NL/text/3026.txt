Written by DTVE Reporter 15 minutes ago US broadband households have more than seven video access devices on average – including TVs, computers, tablets, and smartphones – according to Parks Associates. “Nearly 40% of US broadband households subscribe to multiple OTT video services, and consumers expect to access their high-quality content on any platform, at any location where they live or go for work or fun,” said Elizabeth Parks, senior vice-president, Parks Associates. The news follows recent Parks Associates research claiming that the number of US broadband homes that use digital antennas to access live TV has increased from 16% in early 2015 to 20% near the end of 2017 . The research firm said that while the number of households that have never subscribed to pay TV services has held steady, the percentage that have cut the cord has increased between 2015 and 2017.
