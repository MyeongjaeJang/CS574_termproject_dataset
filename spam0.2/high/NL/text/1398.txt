A series of measures have been set out by the Department for Education (DfE) to raise the status of the social work profession. 
Two new appointments have been set out to work closely with the social work profession and share best practice across the social care system. 
Lord Patel of Bradford, a former social worker, will chair the new dedicated social work regulator, Social Work England, which will set professional, education and training standards for social workers. 
Former Children’s Minister Edward Timpson will chair the independent Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel to consider and share the learnings from the most serious child safeguarding cases. 
Education secretary Damian Hinds said: “The job social workers do couldn’t be more important and yet they are often the unsung heroes of our society. 
“World Social Work Day is about recognising the real difference they make to children and families who find themselves in some of the most difficult circumstances, providing life-changing care and support. 
“This government wants to carry on raising the status of the social work profession which is why we are helping them improve their skills and develop their careers in the interests of the children who need them.” 
As chair of Social Work England, the new dedicated regulator, Lord Patel of Bradford will bring his experience as a former social worker to make sure the workforce’s views are put at the heart of its development. 
The new regulator, jointly set up by the Department for Education and the Department of Health and Social Care, will also make sure all registered child, family and adult social workers have the correct qualifications and meet the standards required for the job and remain fit to practise.
