CRTC collaborates with international partners to fight illegitimate e-marketing activities  48 CET | News The CRTC took part in a global initiative to fight illegitimate online marketing activities. The CRTC worked with 10 agencies from six countries to identify more than 200 international websites as having potential issues. This initiative was conducted through the Unsolicited Communications Enforcement Network ( UCENet ). Its objective was to identify entities that are engaging in online marketing activities that could be considered illegitimate, non-compliant, unfair or fraudulent. As part of that sweep, UCENet partners reviewed over 900 websites and examined more than 6,500 consumer complaints related to affiliate marketing. 
CRTC said the sweep allowed it to increase its understanding of the affiliate marketing ecosystem and adapt its outreach and enforcement activities related to Canada's anti-spam legislation accordingly. The CRTC continues to conduct research on this industry and on the entities that have raised concerns. 
Preliminary results of the investigation have shown that over 200 of all the websites visited were flagged for further action by the group. Also, participating countries that have an opt-in unsolicited communication regime noted that some affiliates did not appear to obtain the consumerâ€™s consent prior to sending electronic communications. Some agencies observed misleading advertising in some segments of the affiliate marketing ecosystem. The sweep also uncovered affiliate marketing programmes that appeared to be compliant with the requirements of unsolicited communication regimes.
