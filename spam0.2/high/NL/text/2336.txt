Australia PC market grows 2.2% in Q4, boosted by education segment   09:42 CET | News Traditional PC shipments in Australia (including desktops, notebooks, and workstations) totalled 1.16 million units in the fourth quarter of 2017, which represents a year-on-year growth of 2.2 percent, according to a report from International Data Corporation (IDC). This was slightly higher than the worldwide PC market's growth of 0.5 percent year-on-year, the report also shows. The overall market was driven by major education deployments, including public and private schools, resulting in growth of the education segment by 56.6 percent year-on-year. 
The study also found that HP and Acer, which had dominated the education segment until recently, faced renewed competition from Lenovo this year, which grabbed 22.7 percent share in this segment, compared to 11.5 percent in the same period of 2016. The government and enterprise sectors posted growth rates of 11.5 percent and 2.3 percent year-on-year, respectively, while SMBs declined by 23.7 percent, despite the federal government tax benefits. 
The report further indicates that the consumer segment was relatively flat year-on-year. The Notebook PC market grew by 2.3 percent year-on-year. Chromebook shipments increased by 67.2 percent year-on-year, the majority of which came from the education segment. Desktop PCs grew by 0.7 percent year-on-year, driven by the gaming enthusiast segment. 
HP, Lenovo and Apple held the top three positions, with 28.4 percent, 16.6 percent and 16.3 percent shares respectively, followed by Dell and Acer Group with 15.2 percent and 11.5 percent, respectively.
