Cox launches 'Cox2M' connected asset services to power smart businesses, cities Monday 19 March 2018 | 20:14 CET | News 
Cox Communications launched Cox2M, the company’s new connected asset services business line for businesses and cities. Cox2M provides sensors that collect data from a variety of connected assets and enable organisations to track, monitor and manage these mobile and fixed assets. The company said its platform bundles connectivity, hardware and software into one package, which eliminates the need for organisations to manage multiple vendor relationships. 
Cox Automotive is an early adopter of Cox2M Connected Asset Services. Manheim is using a custom Cox2M application that delivers real-time tracking of vehicles across auction lots. The platform was piloted in 2017 and will now be implemented across the US and Canada to connect more than 500,000 vehicles. Cox said this is currently the largest LPWA (Low Power Wide Area) commercial IoT deployment in North America. Other Cox Automotive brands are also considering the platform for additional applications. 
Custom asset management products can be tailored to meet the needs of multiple industries, including transportation, fleet management; cities and campuses; energy companies, utilities; agriculture; retail and real estate. 
Cox2M is an open platform that easily integrates into an organisation’s existing systems and processes, creating a seamless IoT (Internet of Things) experience. The platform includes advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities to provide real-time customer insights that inform business and operational decisions. 
Cox2M was incubated in Cox’s New Growth organisation over the last two years and is led by Cox Communications executive director Barak Weinisman. Free Headlines in your E-mail
