Demand leaps 
The production capacity expansion is thanked to Amar Wheels adding of new customers in the European and domestic markets. Also Amar received firm queries from newer markets, which are likely to mature into orders this year. “We are also looking at expanding our customer base in markets of North & Latin America as well as Asia,” he said. With that Amar is anticipating leaps in demand. 
Growing at almost 20% annually, Karan Aggarwal stressed, “Demand for quality components is quite robust in the domestic as well as global market. Demand is always there for quality products, but perception towards India made products requires more time to change.” Amar products
