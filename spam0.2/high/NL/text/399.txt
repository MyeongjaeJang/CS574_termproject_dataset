5Groningen to propose shared access to 3.5 GHz band to defence dept   14:23 CET | News 
The 5G research project 5Groningen said it plans to propose shared access to the 3.5GHz band to the Dutch defence department in order to go ahead with planned tests of the new mobile technology. Programme manager Peter Rake said he will make the proposal in parliament on 29 March. 
Access to the band is restricted in the north of the Netherlands due to intelligence services using the frequencies for satellite communications and monitoring. Rake said he's hoping they can reach an agreement on limited access at designated times for the specific pilots by 5Groningen. This would be smaller scale than an experimental permit, which was already rejected by the state. The Telecom Agency could still act as an intermediary for monitoring the spectrum use. 
The proposal will be made during a roundtable on 5G in the Netherlands planned for 29 March in the lower house of parliament. Experts from the telecom industry will present the current state of affairs and expected developments. The discussion comes as the parliament is looking for a way to kick-start 5G in the country and ensure the release of spectrum already designated by the EU for 5G.
