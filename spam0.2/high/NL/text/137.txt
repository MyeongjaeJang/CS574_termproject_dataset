Nigerian invents device to replace GSM recharge cards   09:14 CET | News 
Nigerian scientist Michael Friday has invented a device called Mobile Intercom to relieve telecom subscribers from buying recharge cards, reports CommunicationsWeek. Friday explained that the quest to free Nigerians from over-dependence on highly expensive, imported telecom services, informed his decision to come up with the innovative idea. 
He recalled the frustrations he had gone through to draw the attention of the authorities to patent his inventions. He said he would require financial grants so that Nigerians can benefit from the discovery. According to him, instead of going through Wi-Fi, the firm's chip sets can transmit up to 5,000 meters, which is about 5 kilometres or there about.
