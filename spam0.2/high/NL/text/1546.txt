Spanish cable operator Telecable, present in Asturias, has announced the appointment of Jose Antonio Vazquez as its new director general. Vazquez has worked in the telecommunications industry for the past 15 years, occupying various positions including regional director for Orange from 2014 to 2016. He replaces Euskaltel investor relations director Aitor Markaida, who was temporarily in charge of Telecable until the appointment of a final candidate. Basque cable operator Euskaltel acquired Telecable Asturias from UK-based telecom investment vehicle Zegona for EUR 686 million last May.
