Italy's Agcom asks Facebook for clarification on data use   10:42 CET | News 
Italian watchdog Agcom has become the latest regulator to request information from Facebook on use of data analytics for political communication by third parties. Recent revelations that Facebook user data had been co-opted by Cambridge Analytica to influence elections in the US prompted Agcom to issue a specific request to Facebook to clarify the way in which it allows third party apps to gain access to user data for the purposes of creating targeted political advertising. In a statement , Agcom suggested these user profiling and selective electoral communication techniques “may have been used back in 2012… on political subjects operating in Italy”. The watchdog said it now wants to ascertain whether such techniques were deployed on users and political subjects during the recent 2018 Italian election campaign.
