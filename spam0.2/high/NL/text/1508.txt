Ghana delays mobile money interoperability to May  07 CET | News 
The Ghanaian government has disclosed that it will roll out the mobile money interoperability system in May after missing about three initial deadlines for the implementation of the policy, reports Citimonline. Vice President, Mahamudu Bawumia is confident the policy will help attract more investments and enhance financial inclusion in the country. He said there is a lot of work that has been done and expects to launch Ghanaâ€™s interoperable system in May. 
The switch means that all mobile companies and all bank accounts will be interoperable. The Ghana Interbank and Settlement Systems (GhIPSS) was mandated to provide the interoperability platform. The contract to GhIPSS came after a botched agreement with Sibton Switch which had earlier agreed to offer the service for some GHC 4.6 billion. The government for the first time gave the GhIPSS a November 2017 deadline . Free Headlines in your E-mail
