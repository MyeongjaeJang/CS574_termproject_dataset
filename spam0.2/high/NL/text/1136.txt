Deutsche Telekom launches Digital X event series in Cologne   11:33 CET | News Deutsche Telekom is launching Digital X, a series of events addressing digitisation in six regions across Germany, as part of its efforts to increase its digital initiatives and support the creation and strengthening of regional business networks. The company is hosting the first of these events, Digitalwest, in Cologne 20 March to bring together mid-sized companies, startups and digital pioneers from the Rhineland with representatives from politics, associations and the media. Telekom said its aim with Digitalwest is to stimulate personal exchanges on digital topics, address uncertainties, help simplify the topic of digitisation and create regional synergies. 
In addition to presentations from politicians on the state of digitisation in the Rhineland, companies like Samsung and Swyx will hold presentations on new trends in technology. Telekom will also single out “digital thought leaders” from the Rhineland by giving out the Regional Digital Champions Award, which qualifies regional winners for Germany’s subsequent national Digital Champions Award in November.
