A philosophical yet entertaining novel, readers of all ages, especially those who are familiar with the New Testament, will be inspired. 
In chapter nine of the Gospel of John, Jesus healed a blind beggar; yet there were no further accounts on the blind beggar who was given the gift of sight. Robert Foster retells the blind beggars story and how he lived after he was healed in Michaels Eyes . Michael was a beggar born without the sense of sight. While sitting on a dusty street, waiting for blessings, a stranger approached him and touched his eyes. The darkness with which he grew up became a new world of light. Michael knew not who the stranger was, but he later learned the man was executed for healing people. Twenty-five years old with no education or skill besides being a beggar, Michael makes his way into the world, looking for answers. Michaels Eyes gives fresh perspective of how Jesus inspired and changed the peoples lives in his lifetime. A philosophical yet entertaining novel, readers of all ages, especially those who are familiar with the New Testament, will be inspired. This book will raise the question  Why do some people believe while others dont? Learn more of Robert W. Foster and his work at www.michaelseyesandotherworks.com .
