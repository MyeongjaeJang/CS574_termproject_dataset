Hunza: A 78-year-old man from Khyber village of Gojal Valley, Hunza, has started a 100km walk to thank a Chinese Red Army doctor who helped him recover from crippling disease four decades back. The walk will complete on 23rd of March, Pakistan Day, in Aliabad. 
Sharing details, Ali Rehbar said that in 1978 he was faced with a crippling disease. He was unable to walk and move around. His family was treating him with locally prepared ‘medicines’, which were futile, because nobody understood the disease. 
During this period, the Chinese Red Army was busy constructing the Karakoram Highway in the region. The Army was accompanied by medical teams who had established a temporary hospital in Passu, a picturesque village. The doctors also used to treat local patients, who referred to them. 
Ali Rehbar was also taken to the hospital, and the doctors were able to treat him successfully. Ali Rehbar was able to walk again after remaining under treatment at the hospital for two months. 
“I am walking for 100 kilometers from Khyber to Aliabad, showing my gratitude and appreciation for the medical help that gave me a new lease of life”, Ali Rehbar told Pamir Times. Ali Rehbar walking on the Karakoram in Hussaini village of Gojal Valley, Photo: Ali Ahmad
