Pictures from the scene show thick, dark smoke rising from above the partially-collapsed shopping center in Kemerovo. 
The smoldering debris prompted a new phase of the fire, Russian Emergencies Minister Vladimir Puchkov told reporters on Monday. Firefighters are tackling the flames, with temperatures reaching 600-800 degrees Celsius in some places, he said. 
“We keep washing down there. The search and rescue mission has to be completed. Relatives of the victims are waiting for the results,” the minister added. 
In the meantime, rescuers have been searching through the five-story building of the Winter Cherry mall, risking their own lives, as the mall’s structure is no longer secure.

Some cases will require genetic expertise due to the condition of the bodies, Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said.
