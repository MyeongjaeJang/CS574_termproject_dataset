Two wellhead systems are on route to Nigeria where they are planned for deployment on Sirius Petroleum’s wells Ororo-4 and Ororo-5. 
Sirius, an investment company focused on oil and gas opportunities in Nigeria, said on Monday that the wellhead system pair follows the delivery of the first two sets of Cameron SOLIDrill modular compact systems in December 2017 . 
The first pair was used to begin the drilling program on the Ororo-2 and Ororo-3 wells. 
The company added that it planned to begin the drilling of its first well on the Ororo Field, the Ororo-2, in April 2018 which would be in a location close to Ororo-1 which was originally successfully drilled by Chevron in 1986. 
All wellhead equipment and services for the Ororo Field are being supplied through Cameron, a Schlumberger Group company. 
According to Sirius, Cameron SOLIDrill modular compact wellhead systems increase casing and tubing hanger landing reliability and help prevent debris from entering the wellhead. The hangers and packoffs are designed with angled shoulders to repel debris, such as dirt, metal shavings, and cement plugs. 
It is worth mentioning that China’s offshore drilling contractor COSL recently began mobilization of the COSL Force jack-up rig to drill two wells on the Ororo field. 
The Ororo field, discovered in 1986, is located within OML 95 in shallow waters offshore Ondo State, Nigeria. The field lies in water depths ranging between 23ft and 27 ft. Share this article
