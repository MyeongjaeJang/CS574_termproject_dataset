Teraco expands Cape Town data centre   10:49 CET | News 
Teraco says it will upgrade and extend its Cape Town data centre facility, with CEO Lex van Wyk saying that the African data centre market continues to rise. Teraco said its total power provision has grown to 50 MW, nearly doubling annually since opening its doors in 2008. Teraco said it has already made significant progress in assisting several strategic cloud brands to enter the market. 
South Africa is well positioned geographically to service the needs of sub-Saharan Africa and on a colocation basis. It is larger than the next 20 African markets combined, van Wyk said. Cape Town is a smaller regional market for Teraco but has recently started to flourish thanks to the increased commercialisation of cloud. Van Wyk said that Teraco Cape Town will be upgraded and extended as more local organisations and international brands seek to colocate and offer services. 
The planned expansion of the Cape Town data centre will result in a facility five times larger than the original footprint completed in early 2009. Teraco's Durban data centre, the smallest of its regional facilities, is also poised for an upgrade, in response to increased demand.
