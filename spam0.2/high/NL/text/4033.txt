Security-as-a-Service grows 21% in 2017, but vendors struggle to adjust to new revenue models Friday 23 March 2018 | 16:49 CET | News 
Security-as-a-service (SaaS) grew 21 percent to USD 4 billion in 2017, following the rise in adoption of cloud products for enterprises, according to a research by Canalys. However, this fast change in revenue stream is creating headaches for vendors who have to rework forecasts for 2018 to not disappoint investors. 
This growth was double the pace compared to the rest of the security market with software and hardware growing respectively 5 percent and 10 percent year-on-year to reach USD 27 billion combined. Researchers estimate the total security market was USD 31 billion in 2017, up 10 percent overall. 
Researchers expect SaaS growth to continue strongly through 2018 and 2019 as vendors keep improving their portfolios and delivery method. This swift shift towards a subscription-based revenue stream is posing challenges for vendors in the industry, especially when it comes to report their results to shareholders. 
Symantec, for instance, missed its Q4 2017 revenue target because it underestimated the adoption of its SaaS products. Despite the strong growth of SaaS, hardware and software will keep growing in 2018 and they will still represent the biggest share of the security market.
