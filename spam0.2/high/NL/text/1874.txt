Mobile ID startup Averon closes USD 5 mln series A1 round   15:23 CET | News 
Mobile ID verification startup Averon has announced the closure of a USD 5 million series A1 funding round led by Avalon Ventures and Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff. The funding follows the startup’s series A round in October 2017, also led by Avalon Ventures, bringing the full series A amount raised to USD 13.3 million. Averon said it will use the financing to accelerate its digital identity innovations, including the mobile authentication service it introduced last year that works whether users are on Wi-Fi or LTE. Averon’s patented techniques use mobile carrier data signalling and hardware already in every smartphone combined with its proprietary blockchain technology to positively and instantly authenticate mobile users without relying on identifiable personal data.
