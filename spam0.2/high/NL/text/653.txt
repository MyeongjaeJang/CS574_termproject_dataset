The congress brings leading experts from around the world to examine research and scientific progress of Angiostrongylus and Dirofilaria in Europe, harmonize best practice procedures for diagnosis, prevention and treatment, and discuss how best to educate veterinary practitioners on the parasitic threat and how to effectively prevent it. New research, prevalance data and geographical spread information will also be presented over a series of seminars by world-renowned experts, clinical workshops and lab sessions throughout the Congress. 
In addition, Bayer will be hosting a scientific symposium on the topic of Angiostrongylus vasorum in companion animals, opened by a keynote from Professor Eric Morgan, researcher in veterinary parasitology and ecology at the Queens University Belfast. 
Angiostrongylus vasorum is a serious growing Parasitological threat across Europe, with identified cases increasing by 1333% since 20021. Across Europe infection has been widely recognised in Ireland, UK and Denmark in the north, France in the west, Greece in the south, Hungary to the east, Germany, the Netherlands and many other countries. Outside of Europe endemic foci are present in Brazil and Canada, and infection has been demonstrated in Uganda, Colombia, Russia and in imported dogs in Australia. Animals affected by Angiostrongylosis may become severely ill and infection can prove fatal in some cases. However, if the infection is promptly cleared, an animal can recover with limited ongoing adverse consequences. 
Dr. Roland Schaper, Global Veterinary Scientific Affairs Manager at Bayer, said: The ESDA congress will help bring together scientific minds and encourage knowledge sharing on A. vasorum and Dirofilarosis . It also plays an important role in educating veterinary professionals on the rapid growing epidemic of A. vasorum 
The 5th Bayer Angiostrongylus Forum will take place on the morning of Saturday, July 7. For further information and to download a registration form visit:
