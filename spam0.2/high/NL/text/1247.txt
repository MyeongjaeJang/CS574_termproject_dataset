SFR separates content from telecom services, to sell more outside customer base Tuesday 20 March 2018 | 17:23 CET | News 
SFR announced a change of brand name for its sports TV offering, which will become RMC Sport in August, ahead of the group stages of the UEFA Champions League. It also said that it will introduce a new pricing model for its three main content propositions (sports, press and cinema), billing them as optional add-ons instead of bundling them automatically within its fixed and mobile packages. The new strategy will be coupled with a renewed effort to sell the content directly to non-SFR customers ( OTT and satellite ), and via new wholesale deals . 
SFR will rename its content add-ons as ‘Les Plus SFR’. For example, ‘Le Plus Sport’ will be billed EUR 5/month to its own subscribers, while the same content will be offered to non-customers for EUR 15/month. ‘Le Plus Cine-Series’ entertainment add-on will be priced EUR 4/month for its own subscribers and EUR 10/month for non-customers. 
Regarding its mobile operations, the operator confirmed that its LTE-A roadmap will bring theoretical 500 Mbps mobile broadband speeds to thirteen metropolitan areas by December, with 1 Gbps connectivity arriving in 2019. It also revealed that it will start trialling 5G at the Altice Campus in Paris later this year, and that it is currently testing a 10 Gbps FTTH service in its laboratory in Velizy.
