Football equals family at Soccer Without Borders WEBWIRE – Monday, March 19, 2018 Fatuma Hussein spent her childhood in a refugee camp before moving to USA The organisation Soccer Without Borders has given her a sense of belonging Fatuma: I dont just have one but two families now 
Fatuma moves with confidence and determination through the grounds of Soccer Without Borders in Oakland, hinting at the fact that the young woman knows every nook and cranny of the organisation that wishes to dissolve societal borders through football. She cheerfully greets the boys and girls she meets and gives them a sunny smile. People here do not just know each other, they value each other. We belong together, she says proudly. 
Fatuma is from Somalia and is 20 years old. She grew up with her mother and five brothers and sisters in a refugee camp in Kenya that has little in common with the city in the sunny state of California, which she has called home for six years now. Life was hard but I didnt notice it at the time, as I didnt have to worry about anything, she says about that time. Her family spent 23 years in the camp; Fatuma spent the first 14 years of her life there. Football only played a small role in her life at that stage. I played every now and then with my brothers. But that was about it. 
Things look very different now, as Fatuma walks across the training grounds of Soccer Without Borders. Football has become a big part of her life. I am convinced that football has the power to unite people from around the world. You dont have to speak the same language to communicate with or understand one another in football.
