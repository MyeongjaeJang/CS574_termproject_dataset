The leader of Yemen’s Shiite rebels has lashed out at the United States, accusing it of fomenting the war in his country through a Saudi-led coalition. In an interview with the Lebanese daily Al-Akhbar on Friday, Abdel-Malek al-Houthi’s also claimed that US ally Israel is participating in attacks in Yemen. Al-Houthi alleged that the US saw the war in Yemen “as a golden opportunity to seek control” of the region, AP reported. He said that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates – two top nations in the coalition against his rebels, known as Houthis – wouldn’t have “entered the war… without American desire and supervision.”
