Alstom to supply 54 additional Coradia Stream Pop regional trains to Trenitalia WEBWIRE – Monday, March 26, 2018 
Alstom has been awarded four contracts totalling around 330 million by Trenitalia, the Italian national train operator, for the supply of 54 Coradia Stream regional trains. The trains are destined for the Italian regions of Abruzzo (4 trains), Liguria (15 trains), Marche (4 trains) and Veneto (31 trains) as part of the framework agreement signed in 2016 between Alstom and Trenitalia[1]. The 54 additional trains add to the 47 trains already ordered by the Emilia Romagna region in 2016. 
Alstoms Coradia Stream for Trenitalia, dubbed Pop by the customer, is the latest generation of trains designed for regional and intercity lines. Coradia Stream is an Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) with maximum speed of 160 km/h in the regional version. The train ordered by Trenitalia can transport more than 300 passengers seated, offering easy accessibility thanks to its low floor. Designed to be eco-friendly, the train is 95% recyclable. 
We are very pleased that Trenitalia and Abruzzo, Liguria, Marche, Veneto have renewed their confidence in Alstoms Coradia range of regional trains and we hope to get on board with other regions. The Pop is proving to be widely appreciated by local authorities and by passengers, who got a glimpse of it in full-scale mock-up form during a recent roadshow, said Michele Viale, Managing Director Alstom in Italy. 
Coradia Stream can be easily customised to different services. Interior layouts and seating arrangements can be modified, to provide for example, more seats for longer journeys, or fewer seats and more standing room for shorter trips. The cars interior layout can be adapted to seasons and specific needs: it is possible to add bicycle or ski racks, electric sockets, Wi-Fi connection, vending machines for drinks and snacks, multimedia areas, areas for working or relaxation. Aboard the Coradia Stream, comfort, space, and light are maximised by larger windows, while advanced services, such as infotainment, audio and video feeds and a live video surveillance system, ensure comfort and security. 
The Coradia Stream Pop trains are manufactured by Alstom in Italy. Project development, most of the manufacturing and certification are performed at Alstoms site in Savigliano, Cuneo. Design and manufacturing of the traction systems and auxiliary switches takes place at the Sesto San Giovanni plant (Milan), and the on-board signalling systems are delivered by the Bologna site.
