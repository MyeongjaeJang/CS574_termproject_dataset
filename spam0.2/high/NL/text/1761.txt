Coimbatore : Close on the heels of the hurling of a petrol bomb on the house of BJP district president Nandakumar, creating tension in the city, another report bomb-throwing at a financier’s house in Selvapuram in the city added to the panic. 
While the engine and front portion of an SUV parked in front Nandakumar’s house in Peelamedu police station limits was gutted, an SUV and a motorcycle parked Umapathi’s place was damaged in the fire, police said. 
In the first incident, CCTV handed over to police by Nandakumar, showed a person standing outside the compound wall and pouring petrol on the vehicle around 3 am. 
Nandakumar later told mediapersons that the party was being targeted by a particular organisation, as two petrol bombs were hurled at the BJP’s office on March 7. 
The throwing of petrol bombs at Umapathi’s house in Selvapuram was around 4.30 am. The fire was doused by Umapathi with the help of neighbours, police said. 
Umapathi lodged a complaint that this could be the handiwork of two youths, who had picked up quarrel with him for advising them against rash driving. 
None was injured in these incidents, police said. Separately, over 100 BJP workers resorted to road roko by squatting on the main Avanashi Road demanding arrest of the miscreants. The workers came in a procession with party flags and raised slogans, disrupting traffic for some time. ALSO READ
