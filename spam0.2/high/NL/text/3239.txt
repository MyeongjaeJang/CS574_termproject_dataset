The PM was branded “deluded” over the state of Britain, on Twitter. 
The Tory leader’s tweet on Friday was met with an angry response by people claiming she was being misleading. Some on Twitter suggested the PM is living in a parallel universe, while others accused her of shirking responsibility to her citizens.
