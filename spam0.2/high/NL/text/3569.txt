Vodafone and Continental introduce smart IoT-connected tyres   11:12 CET | News 
Vodafone and US-based tyre manufacturer Continental are working together to develop smart tyres for cars and buses connected to the Internet of Things (IoT). The digital platform ContiConnect transmits temperature and pressure data on tyres that are transmitted via mobile radio to a centralised web portal, enabling fleet managers to surveil data on their vehicles at any time. 
The system also alerts users when metrics like pressure or temperature hit a critical level and can even offer corrective measures, preventing tyre punctures from occurring. The service has already been introduced in parts of Asia and North America and should be rolled out shortly in all of Europe, Asia, North and South America and Australia, said Vodafone.
