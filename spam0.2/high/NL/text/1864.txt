Philips brings adaptive intelligence to Australia and New Zealand WEBWIRE – Wednesday, March 21, 2018 
Improving workflow and increasing the value that radiology provides to the DHB is a priority for our department. Were delighted to have the opportunity to be some of the first in the world to implement Illumeo and enhance our service across the Northland region.-Dr Alistair Rumball-Smith Radiologist, Northland HDB. 
Northland District Health Board (DHB) is the first user of Philips Illumeo in Australia and New Zealand. Illumeo is an imaging and informatics technology with adaptive intelligence [1] that redefines and enhances how radiologists work with medical images. It combines contextual awareness capabilities with advanced data analytics to augment the work of the radiologist. Northland DHB is not only a pioneer for the ANZ region, but is the first healthcare provider to implement the Illumeo technology outside of the United States. 
Developed in partnership with radiologists, Illumeo is delivering a new approach to how radiologists see, seek and share patient information. Using adaptive intelligence to pull data from various hospital sources, the intelligent software presents a holistic view of the patient and provide diagnostic tools that adapt to physician needs, offering added insights and optimizing their workflow based on their own preferences to enhance clinician confidence for every patient. Illumeo aims to enable faster diagnoses, to drive well-informed care decisions and improved patient care. 
Illumeo integrates with existing systems such as Philips IntelliSpace PACS .
