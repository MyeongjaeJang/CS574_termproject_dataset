Avaya launches UC, CC cloud platform in New Zealand   10:52 CET | News Avaya launched its ‘Powered by Avaya’ cloud offering in New Zealand. The service, launched in partnership with Pyrios, will allow midmarket organisations to migrate to cloud-based unified communications (UC) and contact centre (CC). ‘Powered by Avaya’ is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) stack featuring customisable and flexible UC and CC designed specifically for the midmarket. The full range of products can be deployed on-premises, in a hybrid cloud setup or within a fully-hosted environment, with the ability for end-users to manage their migration to the cloud at their own pace through a subscription-based model. 
Avaya is working closely with Pyrios to enable channel partners to package ‘Powered by Avaya’ as a complete cloud platform. Partners will be able to value-add their own microservices to deliver products for their customers. 
With analyst firm Gartner predicting the public cloud services market increased by 18.5 percent globally, and NZ recognised as a mature market, there is significant potential for channel partners that want to offer the same rich communications experiences customers expect from Avaya solutions delivered on-premises as cloud-based offerings. The launch of ‘Powered by Avaya’ marks the expansion of Avaya’s existing hybrid cloud product portfolio which also comprises the Avaya Oceana, Equinox and Breeze platforms.
