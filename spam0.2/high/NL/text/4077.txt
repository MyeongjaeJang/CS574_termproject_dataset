The future of collaboration: What do bots have to do with it? WEBWIRE – Friday, March 23, 2018 
Though I admittedly have a shameless self-interest in a workforce of the future where human capital is still highly valued, theres no denying that bots will play an important role which was evident in the Verizon booth at the recent annual Enterprise Connect conference. AI-powered bots actually starred in several booth demos, including one that promises to simplify workforce collaboration. 
While at the Verizon booth, I caught up with Michael Winkler with the companys product management and development team who was demonstrating a solution that simplifies workplace collaboration by essentially enlisting AI-powered bots to do the often tedious, yet necessary, tasks of aligning schedules, setting up Cisco WebEx or Spark conference rooms or even reaching out to a team member to check if they are free to join an impromptu discussion. I watched in awe as Mike simply spoke a few commands into his mobile phone  the basic who, what and when  then his bot went to work, and voila, the where soon appeared on his mobile calendar via a meeting invite with a meeting room link that participants can seamlessly and securely open from mobile devices or desktops. 
Enlisting a bot as a personal assistant for work -- think Alexa at your office instead of on your kitchen counter -- is an intriguing idea, especially if this can remove some of the complexity that is often associated with deploying advanced technologies across an enterprise. And while my work bot assistant is not capable of writing my stories and press releases thankfully (a job function still safe from automation!), help with administrative tasks would be a welcome time saver that can lead to greater productivity. 
As Michael explained, to power up the collaboration bots his team created an AI-based bot that can extend to a variety of business applications whether using Cisco Jabber or Spark, or even a Verizon messaging client. This process simplifies access to conferencing services, and can find out when people are available or even just ask if they can join a call. 
This strikes me as a much needed collaboration tool for todays anywhere workforce and the Verizon team is working to make these types of valuable collaboration tools available to its business customers in the future.
