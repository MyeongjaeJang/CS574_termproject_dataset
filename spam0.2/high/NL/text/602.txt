JUBA - 19 Mar 2018 170 students in limbo after Sudan abruptly cancelled exams center in Juba 
Sudan’s ministry of education has abruptly decided not to send examination papers for Sudan Secondary School Certificate to its exaninination center in South Sudan’s capital Juba, leaving 170 students in limbo. 
The African Council for Education and Development, a South Sudanese organization, was registered as a center for Sudan Secondary School examinations in Juba since the last three years. 
Abraham Awuol Nyikher, the spokesman of the African Council for Education and Development, told Radio Tamazuj today that 170 eligible candidates in Juba did not sit for Sudan secondary examinations today after education officials in Sudan refused to send examination papers over alleged insecurity in South Sudan. 
“We had 260 students this year. We were just waiting for index numbers and examination papers, but the council for protection of Sudan Secondary examinations informed us six days ago and said no exams will be sent to Juba this year due to security reasons,” he said. 
“After the cancellation of Juba center, they said there are options to transport the eligible candidates either to Kampala or Khartoum,” he added. 
“We met the parents and informed them about what happened.” 
Nyikher pointed out that about 90 students managed to travel to Ugandan to sit for Sudan Secondary examinations today, while those who did have money missed the exams. 
Sudan’s examinations will kicked off today morning across the Sudanese states and all the centres abroad. Share this
