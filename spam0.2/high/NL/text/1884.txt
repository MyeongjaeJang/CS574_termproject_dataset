Hamburg data protection officer to investigate Facebook privacy settings   15:42 CET | News The Hamburg data protection commissioner Johannes Caspar said he wants to launch an investigation into Facebook’s standard privacy settings in the wake of revelations that the social network may have leaked data on 50 million users to Cambridge Analytica , reported Heise Online. The investigation will concentrate on the interface functions of Facebook apps and games that enable users, and thus app providers, to access data on other Facebook users without their knowledge or permission, Caspar told Heise. 
Caspar criticized this practice of granting apps access to information on other users, saying it has the potential to turn Facebook friends into "potential accomplices in data abuse", wrote Heise. Users will have to explicitly opt-in to this practice after the EU’s new data protection law (GDPR) goes into effect on 25 May, said Caspar. The commissioner said his office will investigate whether Facebook complies with these opt-in rules. 
Caspar further told Heise that procedures at Facebook and Cambridge Analytica show "in a frightening way" that users’ data can be used to influence political decisions as well as consumer behavior.
