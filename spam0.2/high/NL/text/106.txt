TIM handed EUR 4.8 mln antitrust fine for fibre advertising   08:38 CET | News 
Italian antitrust watchdog AGCM has fined Telecom Italia (TIM) a total of EUR 4.8 million for lack of transparency regarding costs and contract terms of fibre-optic services. In a statement, the antitrust body said it had decided to fine for failing to clarify that customers would have to pay an extra amount to benefit from the maximum speed advertised, nullifying the advertised price of the offer. “Telecom Italia… failed to adequately inform consumers about the real characteristics of the service offered and the resulting limitations (in particular the geographical limits of coverage of the various network solutions, the differences in available services and varying performance depending on the infrastructure used to offer the fibre connection),” said the agency. 
The company immediately replied that it would lodge an appeal against the AGCM’s decision to the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio, on the grounds that it was completely unfounded and detrimental to its image and interests. TIM is also facing another antitrust probe into possible abuse in the expansion of its fibre-optic broadband network to underserved and rural areas across the country.
