Lennie James and Suranne Jones to return for second series of hit Sky original production Save Me WEBWIRE – Monday, March 26, 2018 
Critically acclaimed Save Me - created, written by and starring Lennie James and produced by award-winning World Productions (Line of Duty)  is to return for a second series on Sky Atlantic and NOW TV . 
The unique six-part Sky original production introduced us to an unlikely hero in Nelly Rowe (James), the life and soul of his local boozer; a charmer, chancer, fighter, liar and, at his age, a man who should know better. 
The first series of Save Me released on Sky Atlantic and NOW TV at the end of February, has been a hit with viewers and critics alike. A cumulative audience of 1.73 million viewers tuned into the first episode, to watch Nellys world turn upside down after he is arrested and accused of kidnapping his 13-year-old daughter Jody, a child he barely knew existed. 
And with all six episodes available to watch as a box-set, viewers have been devouring each episode on demand, with more than a million people watching the entire series in less than a fortnight. Almost 700,000 of those watched the full series in the first week alone, making Save Me the most rapidly binged box-set release ever on Sky. 
Packed with vivid and compelling characters, the second series will once again star Lennie James as Nelly and the return of Suranne Jones as his ex-lover and Jodys mother, Claire, has also been confirmed. 
The drama has been widely praised by critics with the series being described as the best thing of British television right now [The Times], an outstanding drama [The Telegraph] and a must-see series [Heat], and is attracting positive reviews across the board. On IMDb film & TV database, Save Me has generated more than 1,200 reviews with a score of 8.2, an all-time high for a Sky original production. 
Lennie James said I am so chuffed that we get to keep telling the story of Save Me. Thank you to Sky Atlantic and a huge thank you to everyone who watched our little show and enjoyed it. More to come as soon as I can sit down to write it! 
Suranne Jones said I am so thrilled to be returning for the second series of Save Me. The reaction to the show has been amazing and I love being part of a great ensemble piece. Lennie has fantastic energy and his writing is so real and poetic. I cannot wait to read what he creates next. 
Anne Mensah, Head of Drama at Sky, said: Save Me is a very special Sky original production. It has connected with our audience in a truly visceral way with many viewers watching one episode after another and telling us they simply couldnt tear themselves away from Lennies memorable characters and compulsive storylines. This is an extraordinary show brought to life by a wonderful cast and crew and were honoured to welcome them back to Sky Atlantic and NOW TV. 
Simon Heath, World Productions, said: A huge thank you to Anne and Sky for the terrific support they continue to show for Lennies unique creation. Were thrilled that Nelly and the world of the Towers has struck such a chord with the audience. 
Save Me follows successful performances of other recent Sky original productions such as Britannia, Tin Star and Riviera, and demonstrates Skys continued focus on creating high quality, ambitious British drama. 
The second series of Save Me executive produced by Simon Heath (World Productions), Jessica Sykes (Independent Talent) and Lennie James will go into production in 2019 and full casting is yet to be announced. 
The international distribution rights for Save Me 2 will be handled by Sky Vision, Skys international production and distribution arm.
