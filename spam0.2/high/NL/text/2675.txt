The retired lawyer who took legal action against Amsterdam’s mayor for not doing enough to crack down on bad cycling habits , has lost his case. 
Judges in Amsterdam said Frank Bakker should have directed his law suit at the city council rather than the mayor but said even if he had done that, he would not have won. 
Bakker said that despite losing in court so far, he had had more than 10,000 reactions and messages of support. ‘I’ve had letters, emails and phone calls and everyone says I am right,’ Bakker said. ‘I don’t consider that to be losing.’ 
Bakker is now working on a website which he will use to keep everyone up to date on what his next step will be. Features
