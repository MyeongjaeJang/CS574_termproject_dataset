Gold Coast Tourism estimates the five-day conference will generate more than A$1.2 million (US$0.93 million) directly for the local economy. 
The 2020 Gold Coast GWC bid was supported by the Queensland State Government, City of Gold Coast, Tourism and Events Queensland, Destination Gold Coast, World Surfing League, Surfing Australia, Tim Bonython Movie Festival, and The Drop Live Music Festival. 
GWC executive director Nik Strong Cvetich said: “We are thrilled to see the Global Wave Conference go to Gold Coast in 2020 as it is the 8th World Surfing Reserve. The Global Wave Conference was established in the Canary Islands, followed by Biarritz, Mexico, UK and Santa Cruz. 
“Gold Coast will be such an exciting venue for the 6th biannual held the week before the World Surfing League world tour event at Snapper Rocks, and in the year that surfing is introduced into the Olympics for the first time.” TAGS
