Ampelmann’s gangway system will be used aboard a Wagenborg vessel to crew transfer and gas production in the Dutch and UK sectors of the Southern North Sea. 
Ampelmann said that the A-type Enhanced Performance (AEP) gangway system would transfer personnel from Wagenborg Offshore’s second walk to work emergency response and rescue vessel (W2W ERRV) Kasteelborg. 
The AEP gangway system, launched in July 2017, features an advanced motion compensation control system with precision controls to enable fast landing and comfortable people transfers. It is designed to transfer 20 personnel safely and efficiently in less than five minutes and move cargo loads of up to 100 kg. It can operate in sea states up to 3.5-metre significant wave height. 
The company said that the dimensions of the AEP were the same as Ampelmann’s original A-type gangway system with the ability to use smaller vessels to obtain similar or even better performance and operational stability. 
Joeri Poelmann , Ampelmann’s manager of sales and business development for Europe and Africa, said: “[…] Wagenborg’s latest Walk to Work vessel combined with Ampelmann’s AEP will enable workers safe and easy access to carry out essential offshore maintenance activities. 
“The gangway system significantly improves operational up-time on projects year-round and provides benefits to operators in rougher waters, including the North Sea, the coasts of South America, and the Middle East.” 
As for the vessel, Kasteelborg will support the offshore activities on the southern North Sea under a six-year contract with the Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (NAM) and Shell UK Exploration & Production. 
The Kasteelborg was converted from a standard offshore supply vessel to a specialized Walk to Work vessel in just 12 weeks at the Royal Niestern Sander shipyard in The Netherlands. The vessel is also equipped with an additional accommodation module and motion compensated crane. Share this article
