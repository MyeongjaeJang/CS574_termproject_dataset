Samsung unveils 'South Korea's largest LED signage' in Gangnam district Thursday 22 March 2018 | 08:34 CET | News Samsung Electronics has finished installing a light-emitting diode (LED) signage in southern Seoul. Samsung installed the signage at the COEX shopping mall and convention center, located in the Gangnam district, Yonhap news agency reports. The signage is 81 meters wide and 20 meters high, with the brightness reaching 9,000 nits. Samsung claims the resolution is also two times better than Ultra HD displays. 
The Seoul local authorities have recently eased signage-related regulations for the areas surrounding COEX to transform the area into the Korean version of New York's Times Square. The project was carried out jointly with advertising firm CJ Powercast, and the Korea International Trade Association. 
The signage will be used to promote K-pop and show other commercials starting 25 March.
