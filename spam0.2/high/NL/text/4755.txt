Share on: google + This week, our instalment of footballer’s music comes from a Premier League player; Huddersfield Town’s Rajiv van La Parra. An established player in the Championship for a couple years, the Dutchman is a strong member of the Terriers’ debut season squad in England’s top flight and took time to tell us what music he’s listening to at the moment. He starts his playlist with a banger from Dave East’s 2013 album, Paranoia: A True Story. On Perfect , the rapper pairs up with Chris Brown who kills the hook in typical fashion, whilst East does his thing on a chilled out, modern US beat to kick-off Rajiv’s musical selection. Next, the winger keeps it UK with MoStack and Birmingham rap star, Mist. These two are hitting serious numbers in Britain right now, with their versatile music providing a hit in clubs, YouTube sessions and apparently in Premier League player’s headphones, too. Next, it’s back to the US for a sizeable collab from the controversial 6ix 9ine, Tory Lanez and Young Thug. Rondo is a typically energetic track from 6ix 9ine as the delivery of the oft-violent rapper comes through, as per. Plug Talk by Gucci Mane provides a slightly more chilled out track in comparison, as the notorious Southern rapper keeps it very Alabama on this one. Another huge collab comes next on van La Parra’s hip-hop heavy playlist, as the likes of Lil Yachty, Wiz Khalifa and PnB Rock feature on a remix of YFN Lucci’s Everyday We Lit. He keeps it within the hip-hop superpowers for Walk It Talk It; the Drake-featuring hit from Migo’s recently dropped album, before playing us out with something a little different – some French rap from a legend of that particular rap music realm, Booba.
