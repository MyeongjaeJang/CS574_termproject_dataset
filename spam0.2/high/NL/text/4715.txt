The number of fines handed out to motorists who were using their mobile phones while driving rose by almost 25% last year, the Telegraaf reported on Tuesday. 
In total, 74,561 people were stopped by police for driving and phoning at the same time and fined the standard €239. 
Some 8% of motorists who were fined for using their phones appealed against their conviction. However, of the 6,177 appeals, only 184 were successful, the Telegraaf said. 
Earlier this month it emerged that Dutch police are planning to use cameras with long distance lenses to try to catch motorists who use their mobile phones while driving. 
The cameras will be fixed to viaducts and gantries and will take close-up pictures of every driver, allowing the police to spot drivers who have their phones in their hands. 
Currently, people can only be fined if spotted driving while phoning by a police officer. 
The government wants to class using a mobile phone screen at the wheel as ‘reckless behaviour’ equivalent to driving under the influence of drink and drugs. This could lead to a driving ban and prison sentences for the worst offenders. Features
