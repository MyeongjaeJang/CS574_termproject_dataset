ZICTA says Vodafone did not apply for voice licence in Zambia   09:25 CET | News 
Zambian telecom regulator ZICTA says Vodafone Zambia did not apply for a licence to provide voice services, allaying speculation that the UK-based telecoms provider was sidelined when ZICTA issued a licence to UZI Zambia, reports Lusaka Times. ZICTA spokeswoman Ngabo Nankonde said UZI Zambia and Broadband Square were the only two firms to apply for the licence to operate both data and voice services. 
Nankonde said that Vodafone, which already holds a data licence in Zambia, did not apply for a voice licence on its own accord. She said ZICTA accepted UZI's application after a technical and business evaluation showed that the company had the best strategy to expand its network in Zambia. Nankonde said the regulator considers that Uzi Mobile will use its Unitel connection in Angola to improve Zambia's connectivity to the Angolan fibre backbone and in turn to the subsea cables landing there. This could create a direct route to South-North America to through the South Atlantic cable system, thereby connecting Brazil to the US and providing a shorter connection to the West African cable system. 
Nankonde said the major shareholders in UZI are based in the Netherlands and have pledged to invest USD 350 million in their Zambian operations and create 450 direct job opportunities. She said ZICTA is interested in good quality of service and extension to under-served areas of the country, adding that the authority is hoping that at the end of this year, Zambia would have a 100 percent coverage.
