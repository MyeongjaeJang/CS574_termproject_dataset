VLN: BMW teams get underway in the Nordschleife season. 
The battle for points and victories has started again in the Green Hell.

The best-placed BMW drivers were Nick Catsburg (NED), John Edwards (USA) and Richard Westbrook (GBR) in the ROWE Racing number 98 BMW M6 GT3. After four hours of racing they claimed tenth place overall. Jens Klingmann (GER) and Peter Dumbreck (GBR) reached eleventh in the Falken Motorsports BMW M6 GT3. For 2018, the SP9 category is split into subcategories for the first time and points are up for grabs in all three of them. First place in the SP9 Masters standings went to Henry Walkenhorst, Rudi Adams and Andreas Ziegler (all GER) in the number 36 BMW M6 GT3. Uwe Ebertz (GER) and Michael Hollerweger (AUT) also recorded a class win in the number 160 Pixum Team Adrenalin Motorsport BMW M4 GT4 in the SP8T category. In the SP10 class, the BMW M4 GT4 of Team 828 Racing by Sorg Rennsport crossed the line in second place with Heiko Eichenberg (GER) and Yannick Mettler (SUI) behind the wheel.

FIA WEC: Fitness camp for BMW drivers in Viareggio. 
Around six weeks before the start of the season, the four regular BMW drivers in the FIA World Endurance Series (WEC) underwent a week of intensive fitness training. From Tuesday to Thursday, Nick Catsburg (NED), António Félix da Costa (POR), Augusto Farfus (BRA) and Martin Tomczyk (GER) completed a three-day fitness camp in Viareggio (ITA). Supervised by team doctor Dr. Riccardo Ceccarelli (ITA) and his Formula Medicine Team, the four drivers trained according to a schedule specially tailored to their requirements. The training camp was a welcome opportunity for us, the drivers, to meet up away from the racetrack, says Tomczyk. The training was tough but we had a lot of laughs and enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere. Dr. Ceccarelli is a motorsport institution. He has been doing this for some years and he has worked with many of the big names. We know that we are in good hands with him.
