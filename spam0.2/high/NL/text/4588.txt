In the past, Phase I ESAs were conducted almost entirely for commercial property transactions, but today a growing number of people involved with residential transactions are also requesting these assessments. 
Before a commercial property transaction takes place, a Phase I Environmental Site Assessments (Phase I ESA) will usually be ordered. The Phase I ESA is used by potential property buyers, investors and lenders to determine if a property has any environmental contamination issues and to assess any potential liability from any contamination that is found. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued the All Appropriate Inquires (AAI) Rule  Environmental Site Assessments, Phase I Investigations in 2005. It established the standards and requirements for conducting the necessary investigations to qualify for landowner liability protection under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). CERCLA, also known as Superfund, was established to address abandoned hazardous waste sites. Among other things, CERCLA establishes a liability scheme for determining who can be held accountable for releases of hazardous substances. In the past, Phase I ESAs were conducted almost entirely for commercial property transactions, but today a growing number of people involved with residential transactions are also requesting these assessments, said Harry Pena, President of Zimmetry Environmental. Phase I ESAs help to provide answers about past land uses that are so important to investors, buyers and lenders.
