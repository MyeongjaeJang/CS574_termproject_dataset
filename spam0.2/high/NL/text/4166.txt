Spacecom said it has chosen Maxar Technologies company SSL to build its AMOS-8 communications satellite, which will provide broadcast, broadband and data services from Spacecom's 4 degrees West location to Europe, Africa and the Middle East. AMOS-8 will include Ku-band and Ka-bandpay loads with steerable antennae so customers can deliver various added value services. 
The satellite is designed to provide service for a minimum of fifteen years and is based on the SSL 1300 commercial communications satellite platform, which can support a broad range of advanced applications and technologies. The AMOS-8 geostationary communications satellite will be co-located with AMOS-3. 
A contract option has been signed by Spacecom and SpaceX for AMOS-8's scheduled launch in the second half of 2020. AMOS-8 will bring additional capacity to expand its offerings and provide its partners with the abilities to add new and exciting services, said David Pollack, CEO of Spacecom.
