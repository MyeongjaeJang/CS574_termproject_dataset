Ericsson forms Ericsson Energy Alliance with Vertiv, NorthStar   14:30 CET | News 
Ericsson joined forces with Vertiv and NorthStar to form the Ericsson Energy Alliance, a complementary site platform partnership to drive cost-effective and sustainable service provider network evolution towards 5G, within the Ericsson Radio Site System. The alliance was formed in late 2017 and has seen success in customer projects rolled out in countries such as Mexico, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Tanzania. More companies are also expected to join the alliance in 2018. 
The alliance brings Vertiv’s global expertise in power, thermal and infrastructure site management products, and Sweden-based NorthStar’s experience in battery and energy storage products, into the Ericsson Radio Site System to establish a competitive ecosystem and management interface and increase the market share of the Enclosure and Power parts of the system portfolio. 
Alliance partners are also combining strengths in regional sales support. They have also established a harmonised ecosystem for energy supply and storage. 
Energy and climate systems are also optimised to use the minimum required energy to provide an electronic trusted environment for Ericsson Radio System products, delivering environmental as well as cost-efficiency benefits for service providers. Future joint-development of products is being considered.
