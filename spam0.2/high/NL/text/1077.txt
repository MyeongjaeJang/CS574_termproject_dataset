South Africa’s SensePost has launched a Managed Detection and Response service, “Managed Threat Detection,” for the enterprise, reports Mybroadband. SensePost’s Managed Threat Detection service provides a managed and proactive system for organisations looking to strengthen their cybersecurity. 
The cloud-based system can easily be deployed by companies and collects data from multiple sources at a customer’s premises. These sources include firewalls, networks, endpoints and security devices like honeypots, and do not require agents to be installed by the user. SensePost’s dedicated threat intelligence and research team, working with a proactive threat hunting team, identifies whether alerts indicate an attack or compromise. Detailed reports, delivered in real-time, then enable users to respond to issues as quickly as possible. Free Headlines in your E-mail
