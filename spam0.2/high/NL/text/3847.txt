After cruising through his group, Watson defeated Justin Thomas, Kiradech Aphibarnrat and Brian Harman. Watson was dominant off the tee and with his wedges, and could be a major factor in two weeks at Augusta National. Amazing touch. @BubbaWatson gets up-and-down to close out @K_Kisner in 12 holes.#QuickHits pic.twitter.com/MZesj4vZPj
