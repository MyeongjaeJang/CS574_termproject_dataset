March 22, 2018 Fashion: Discovering Tobi for Fashionable Cute Clothes I love discovering a fashion retailer I had no idea of before, so this blog post is dedicated to a fashion brand called Tobi which I’ve been trying out this month! 
So as you can probably tell, I’ve been exploring the more ‘Spring’ style items, which aren’t quite right for this cold snap we’re suffering from in the UK. However, ain’t nothing like being ahead of the game, right? 
I picked three sassy little outfits from the Tobi website and have been sharing my picks over on my Instagram over the last few days… The first one is this super cute little dress, the Behind Rose Doors Red Mini Dress . It has a sweet little tie-up bow to the front and a swishy skirt detail, giving an overall girly, pretty outfit. 
It also features a cut out back, making it perfect for those up-and-coming holidays. I’ll be pairing this with killer heels and an oversized clutch bag for any nights out when Spring/Summer is here, but I’d also wear this to throw onto of a bikini on holiday, for strolling on the beach. The next item is my favourite of all three, mainly because I just love a good jumpsuit. They are just so practical, fashionable and versatile. You can wear jumpsuits for work, nights out, days out… literally an occasions. It just depends how dressy you want it to look! 
This Walk on the Wide Side item is a wide legged cross front detail jumpsuit, with a tie to pull in the back. Due to its wide leg and loose fitting style, I find this works well with super stacking heels. And due to it’s low cut front, you could add some long chain necklaces to add some delicate details. And last but not least, I opted for a bit of the cold shoulder trend. This Twist and Shout Cold Shoulder Top comes in a fresh olive colour and can actually be worn two ways. You can pull it off your shoulders like I have below, or you can use the tie strings that come with it and play around with them, creating halter style straps. 
It looks sassy and grown up worn with tailored trousers, but you could also wear it with cut off denim shorts on holiday. 
Another versatile item! I LOVE uncovering online fashion brands I didn’t know existed before, so please do let me know if you’re loving any at the moment and feel I should know about them! Follow:
