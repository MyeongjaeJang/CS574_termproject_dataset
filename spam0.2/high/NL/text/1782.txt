Coimbatore: Despite the government having put in place various schemes for the welfare of differently abled people, little appears to be done by officials concerned to implement them. 
A blind middle-aged man was seen moving on the premises of the Collectorate office. The Covai Post learnt he had been running from pillar to post to get a job for his wife under the disability scheme. 
Ishwaran and his wife Radha had sent a letter in this regard to the Prime Minister’s cell but never got a reply following which they approached the Collectorate to look into the matter. Radha was selected for the post of a teaching assistant during an interview conducted at Sulur in December 2017 and was told she was eligible for the job under the disability scheme. But the officer at the Anganwadi demanded a bribe of Rs 1 lakh. 
A frustrated Ishwaran said, “Upon seeing me at the Collectorate, the Probationary Officer asked staff who allowed us to come here. They are after all handicapped so how do we work with them; they should sit quietly at home.” He added that officials at the Collectorate also did not give ‘proper response”. 
Ishwaran said sources revealed that a woman was appointed in place of Radha after she paid an amount. On persistent demand for justice, the couple earned the tag of ‘troublemakers’. He said the Child Development Project Officer of Sultanpet and a woman Vimala were adamant in not giving a job to his wife. Abuses were also hurled by Vimala who was posted at Arasur, he said. 
Ishwaran alleged that the CDPO also said those in SC quota should not be given these jobs. He wondered why such facilities were there when officials did not want them around. ALSO READ
