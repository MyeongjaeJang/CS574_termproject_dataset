MARIDI - 21 Mar 2018 Baka Community sponsors 10 girls to secondary school in Maridi 
The Baka community in South Sudan’s Maridi State has offered 10 scholarships to girls in the area to pursue their secondary education. 
Daniel Owudada, the chairman of the Baka community in Maridi told Radio Tamazuj on Tuesday that the scholarships are meant to encourage girl child education. 
“Our office in Juba is sponsoring 10 girls in the university and they have now extended the scholarship here in Maridi. So we have selected 10 girls we will take to boarding Maridi girls’ boarding school. The community will pay 10,000 SSP per term for the 10 girls every year until they finish senior four in four years’ time,” Owudada said. 
Mariyaka Ramadan, whose daughter is a beneficiary of the scholarship, praised the initiative saying it is a huge responsibility that will yield fruits for the community. 
“I have three children in senior and three in primary. The community has helped so much to take one of my daughters to boarding school something I have always wanted but because of the little pay I get I could not afford. This initiative is a huge responsibility and we are very thankful,” 
Another resident Jackline Alfred Hayat, a mother to one of the beneficiaries said her daughter can now study without any financial challenges. 
“I have done all kinds of odd jobs to get school fees for my daughter, when I got some little money I started selling tea until now. I have prayed and now the Baka community have come to help rescue me. Am so happy,” said Hayat.
