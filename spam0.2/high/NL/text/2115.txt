Aviva welcomes whiplash legislation WEBWIRE – Wednesday, March 21, 2018 
Aviva has welcomed an announcement by the government that it will introduce a Bill to reform how whiplash claims are handled and update how the personal injury Discount Rate is set. 
Commenting on the announcement, Rob Townend, Managing Director, Aviva UK General Insurance, said: 
The government has called time on the UKs compensation culture which costs honest motorists Ł5 million a day. The whiplash reforms are badly needed to cut cost pressures on drivers. 
Together with the Financial Guidance and Claims Bill, these measures signal the end of the era of crash for cash and nuisance calls. Aviva has campaigned tirelessly for these reforms and I repeat our commitment to pass on 100% of the savings to our customers. 
We also welcome the governments commitment to updating how the personal injury discount rate is calculated. This important legislation should ensure that those who suffer serious injuries receive full and fair compensation without the unnecessary impact on premiums. Again, we commit to passing on any savings from this legislation to our customers.
