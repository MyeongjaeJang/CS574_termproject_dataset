Brandy tried to extend an olive branch to her sister in law Princess Love , but Princess put Brandy on full blast. 
Apology not accepted! Brandy and her mama are reportedly feuding after Princess is said to have shaded her brother Ray J on social media. The spat resulted in Brandy and Sonja not attending Ray J’s baby shower (details). A few hours ago, Brandy took to Instagram to put things right, but look at what Princess wrote in the comments section *crickets* Family feuds are not nice. My mum and her sister were feuding for months, and only made up after their youngest sister took seriously ill with cancer. It took the ending of a life for them to get close again, and a new life is about to come into theirs. Life is too short. I hope they can sort it out before Brandy’s little niece makes her debut into the world. The baby will most likely bring them together again.
