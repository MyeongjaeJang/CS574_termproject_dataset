ADATA launches XPG SX8200 PCIe M.2 SSD by Email 
Coming in 240GB, 480GB and 960GB capacities 
ADATA has announced its newest XPG-series SX8200 PCIe NVMe 1.3 M.2 SSD which will be available in 240GB, 480GB, and 960GB capacities and offer transfer speeds of up to 3200MB/s for read and 1700MB/s for write. 
Based on Silicon Motion's SM2262 controller and Micron's 64-layer 3D TLC NAND, the new ADATA XPG SX8200 SSD comes in standard M.2 2280 form-factor and uses PCIe 3.0 x4 NVMe 1.3 interface. The ADATA XGP SX8200 comes in 240GB, 480GB, and 960GB capacities although we expect to see a 1.92TB one in the near future as well. 
Performance-wise, the ADATA XPG SX8200 offers sequential read and write performance of up to 3200MB/s and 1700MB/s, with maximum 4k random read and write performance of up to 310K and 280K IOPS. 
Being a direct successor of the previously available XPG SX8000 series, ADATA was keen to note that these should be as durable as the earlier series, offering both the same endurance and backed by the same five year warranty. 
As expected, it also features SLC caching and DRAM cache buffer and comes bundled with black XPG heatsink with pre-applied thermal compound allowing you to choose between the clean black PCB look or the one covered by the black XPG heatsink. 
As far as the price goes, we expect it to retail at somewhere around US $140 for the 240GB, US $260 for the 480GB and US $480 for the 960GB model, which puts it slightly above the XPG SX8000 SSD lineup. Last modified on
