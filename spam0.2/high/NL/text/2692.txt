Lifts have now been installed at Bromley-by-Bow station for the first time, making it the 73rd step-free station on London's Underground network. 
The station will feature step-free access to both the east and westbound platforms of the District and Hammersmith & City lines, making travel easier for disabled customers, buggy users, older people and customers with mobility impairments. 
The completion of the work follows the Mayor of London's recent announcement that another 13 stations are set to go step-free by spring 2022. In total, Â£200 million is being invested in transforming accessibility as part of the largest boost to step-free access in the Tube's 155-year history. 
This will help make 40 per cent of the Tube network step-free by 2022 - a significant increase on the current level of 27 per cent. 
Deputy Mayor for Transport Val Shawcross said: 'We're determined to ensure that London has a modern transport network that is accessible for every Londoner. 
'That's why Sadiq is investing records sums to deliver the largest boost to step-free access in the Tube's 155-year history. 
'I'm delighted that Bromley-by-Bow is the next station to go step-free and know that these new lifts will make a particular difference helping parents with young children, older people and those with disabilities get around safely and easily every day.'
