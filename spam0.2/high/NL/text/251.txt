Hotel Investment In Barcelona On Hold Since October 2017 tourism-review.com 
The hotel investment industry in Barcelona has been on hold since last October 1, due to the political crisis in Catalonia and, even though numerous investments have been on decline, diverting to cities like Madrid or Valencia, there is still interest in the hotel market as the city regains its stability. 
According to sources from the consulting hotel services BRIC Consulting, investors still believe in Barcelona's hotel industry and in recent days, it seems the hotel investment market is taking off again, although this demands for a necessary "political stability." 
The hotel investment in Barcelona that has been paralyzed, has taken shelter in much safer assets that do not rely exclusively on the tourist influx, such as the residential hotels, or has completely diverted to cities like Madrid, Valencia or Bilbao. 
Some investors, however, expect the situation to be resolved since now there are assets worth over 100 million euros waiting for potential buyers, which includes hotels and tourist apartments.
