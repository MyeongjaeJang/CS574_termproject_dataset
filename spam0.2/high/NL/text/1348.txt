Telia Denmark tests start-up's alarm system in care home Tuesday 20 March 2018 | 12:07 CET | News 
Telia Denmark said that the Sarita CareTech personal safety device that won Telia's Jump digital start-up competition last year has now gone on trial at a care home for elderly people in Aarhus. The Sarita Pearl combines GPS, emergency button, fall alarm and interface allowing family members or staff to monitor the user. The device aims to resolve the problem of wearers being unable to press the manual alarm button in time, said Telia. 
Sarita has also thought about the design, doing away with utilitarian form such as an orange rubber armband, and instead shaping its device as a brooch that can be customised with a logo or photograph.
