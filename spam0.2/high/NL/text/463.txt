Wire Service Multiple Metropolitan Areas in California Make the Top 10 List for Bed Bug Infestations LA Testing provides easy-to-use test kits that utilize advanced qPCR testing methods to identify the presence of bed bugs (Cimex lectularius). Huntington Beach, CA – WEBWIRE – Monday, March 19, 2018 
Last month, Orkins list of the Top 50 Bed Bug Cities was released to the public and included several major population centers in California. The highest ranking city in California was Los Angeles (ranked 4 th ) followed by the San Francisco/Oakland/San Jose area (9 th ) and San Diego (41 st ). The list was reportedly compiled from bed bug treatment data from the pest control companys operations from December 1 st of 2016 through November 30 th of 2017. 
Bed bugs are small, flat, parasitic insects that feed on the blood of people and animals while they sleep. These tiny insects are experts at hiding, which can make them quite difficult to find with just a visual search. 
Over the past decade, there have been increasing reports of bed bugs infestations in places that had not had these types of infestations for decades or more, said Michael Chapman, Laboratory Manager at LA Testings Huntington Beach facility. Locations with infestations are not confined to just homes and hotels as many people might think. Reports of bed bugs invasions in recent times have included everywhere from libraries to movie theaters and beyond. 
To help spot bed bug infestations and to confirm treatment and cleanup activities have been comprehensive, LA Testing offers an easy-to-use bed bug test kit that identifies these small pests through the science and power of DNA-based laboratory techniques. This means only a small dust sample needs to be collected from the area to be tested. These same quick and affordable tests are also becoming increasingly common with people looking to buy, rent or lease homes, apartments and condos before they sign on the dotted line.
