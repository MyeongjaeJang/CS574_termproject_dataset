  IHG to bring new wellness oriented hotel to Georgia InterContinental Hotels Group and established hospitality developer, Epelboim Development Group, have announce a groundbreaking new EVEN® Hotels property in Alpharetta, Georgia.   
Set to open in the third quarter of 2019, the new-build construction hotel continues the expansion of the wellness-focused brand’s footprint in the Southeast and marks the first location in metro Atlanta. This comes on the heels of the brand’s recent openings of two EVEN Hotels in Sarasota, Florida and Eugene, Oregon. 
The six-story EVEN Hotel will feature 132 rooms, four suites, flexible public workspaces, 750 square feet of meeting space, a business centre, onsite restaurant and a 1,200-square-foot Athletic Studio. 
The hotel will also incorporate the brand’s signature in-room fitness elements and a balance of health-conscious and indulgent food and beverage options to help guests maintain their wellness routine while traveling away from home. 
“We are enthused to work alongside Epelboim Development Group on its second EVEN Hotels project as we continue to grow the brand in the Southeast," says Joel Eisemann, chief development officer, Americas, IHG. 
"This new hotel will provide an innovative guest experience for wellness-minded business and leisure travelers and demonstrates the confidence our owners have in this growing brand.” 
The hotel will feature a best-in-class fitness experience with the brand’s signature Athletic Studio that is larger than typical hotel gyms. Every guest room will include an in-room fitness zone with a dedicated workout space with fitness equipment and 18 different workout videos, ranging from 10 to 30 minutes in length. 
The EVEN Hotel Alpharetta will also feature the brand’s signature Cork & Kale café, offering a menu that emphasizes variety, dine-in meals and quicker options like breakfast sandwiches and fresh salads from the Grab-and-Go marketplace that will be available 24/7 for guests’ convenience.
