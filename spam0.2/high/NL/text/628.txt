Banking on our Lowcountry Community 
We were pleased and honored to be invited by our good friends at Royall Ace Hardware to the Lowcountry Foodbank’s Annual Gala last month. What a great way to support our community! Shining up their shoes and showing off for the cameras were James Semmens, our talented woodworking artisan, and Tracey Deck, our front office customer service director. We loved the opportunity to give a little something back to our lowcountry friends who work hard to make Charleston and Mt. Pleasant a great place to live, work, and give.

I have always been overly impressed with the finished product. I will always use them, and I highly recommend them to my friends.” Chicago area designer, Heather Milligan says, “There is no better or more talented group than Chehaw River Woodworks. I am forever grateful for their amazing skill and keen eye. If you are looking for a piano-finish lacquer in which you can literally see your reflection, look no further. I think there is nothing they cannot build, refurbish or repair. I love this company! They are gold.”– HMDesign Jan and Bill Hogan say: We just wanted to let you know how much we like the work you did on our kitchen table and chairs. The color and finish is beautiful! – just what I was envisioning. I so appreciate the time and commitment you gave to getting it right! 45 Let us repair, refinish, reclaim, or restore the furniture you treasure. Request an Estimate
