Enlargement, external relations and trade, - Events/Conf/Fairs Cecilia Malmström, European Commissioner for trade, and H.E. Eng. Yarub Qudah, the Jordanian Minister of trade, industry and supply - as Union for the Mediterranean co-presidencies - are hosting the 10th Union for the Mediterranean trade ministerial conference. The conference will gather the 43 trade Ministers of the Union for the Mediterranean’s Member States. It is significant as there has not been a Union for the Mediterranean trade ministerial meeting since November 2010. It is an important juncture for members to take stock of the developments that occurred in this period of time and is a valuable opportunity to explore the potential that is still to be unlocked. The conference is expected to develop initiatives to facilitate and increase trade and investment flows, in order to enhance and strengthen the mutually beneficial economic integration process in the Mediterranean region.
