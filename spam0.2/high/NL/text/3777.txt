The convention's communications and public relations coordinator for the event, Ronnie, describes furries as "people that enjoy arts and culture centred around animals and animal-themed topics, essentially. Furnal Equinox in particular, we like to celebrate in a very visual and very [...] artistic nature, where we have lots of arts and performances and crafts that go on, and people celebrate with lots of socialisation involved." 
Of the attendees, Ronnie told Wikinews "they come from all walks of life. They are people of all ages, sizes, all sorts of backgrounds, and they come together under one mutual interest, which is their love for animal culture." 
"Programming at Furnal Equinox involves[...] a lot of informational panels, so you can find out about topics from art and how to draw, or how to visually incorporate different elements into your artworks. You can also find panels that teach you how to write better, be a better fiction author for example," explained the event representative. 
At one panel Wikinews attended, members of its all-volunteer organising committee spoke of the year-long process of planning the event, and their reasons for committing such a significant amount of their time. Said one panelist, "if you're happy, we're happy."
