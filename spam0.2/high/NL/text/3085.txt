Education secretary Kirsty Williams has thanked school business managers from across Wales for their role in reducing headteachers’ workload. 
Speaking at the Institute of School Business Leadership (ISBL) conference in Cardiff’s City Hall, the education secretary said: “Teachers and headteachers need to be able to concentrate on the roles that they are best equipped to perform, roles that they trained for, roles that made them want to become teachers in the first place. 
“There are many things that can get in the way of this and teachers frequently tell me about the pressures they face due to workload. 
“We have listened and that’s why, last year, I announced funding of £642,000 for the School Business Manager project.” 
She continued: “Coupled with match-funding from local authorities this means that over £1.2 million is available for pilots in eleven areas. 
“The aim of the project is to help headteachers manage their workload and focus on raising standards and school improvement. 
“The pilots are currently supporting over 100 schools with dedicated support for headteachers and teachers.” 
“We are already seeing encouraging results with business managers freeing up headteachers’ time by working on areas such as HR, Finance, Audit, Facilities Management and Procurement issues.”
