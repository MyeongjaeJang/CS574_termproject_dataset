Questions to Facebook and WhatsApp “are much more acute” than the Telegram. This was stated by the Minister Nikolai Nikiforov, reports RIA Novosti.

The Minister also urged to “organize less information events associated with only one Telegram”. 
“In my opinion, in all of history, when we talk about the aspect of dealing with terrorism and trying those or other messengers to blame the fact that they are used for those or other illegal actions, I think the most important thing is to have a single approach,” said Nikiforov during his working visit to Rostov-on-don.
