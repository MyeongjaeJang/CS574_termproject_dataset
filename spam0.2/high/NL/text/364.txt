GovSat-1 satellite goes operational Monday 19 March 2018 | 14:34 CET | News The first satellite of GovSat, the joint venture by SES and the Luxembourg government, entered operational service on 19 March to provide secure communications to governmental and institutional users. Dedicated entirely to governmental and institutional users, GovSat-1 was launched into space on 31 January on board a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and has since undergone extensive testing. GovSat is a public-private partnership between the Government of Luxembourg and satellite operator SES. 
The multi-mission satellite is operated by GovSat from the Secure Mission Operations Centre in Luxembourg. The highly flexible and resilient GovSat-1 payload uses dedicated frequencies in X-band and military Ka-band. It enables an array of applications such as connectivity for theatres of operation, interconnection of institutional or defence sites, border control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), as well as various types of communications on the move for land and maritime missions. 
GovSat-1 is located at the 21.5 degrees East orbital slot, which allows it to support missions over Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, as well as providing extensive maritime coverage over the Mediterranean and Baltic seas, and the Atlantic and Indian oceans. GovSat-1 features high-powered fully-steerable spot beams, an X-band Global beam and a total of sixty-eight transponder equivalent units. Free Headlines in your E-mail
