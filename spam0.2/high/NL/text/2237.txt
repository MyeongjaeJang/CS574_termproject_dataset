ETSI, OPNFV announce co-located testing, interoperability events Wednesday 21 March 2018 | 19:48 CET | News ETSI and OPNFV will co-locate their next community testing events in Sophia Antipolis, France. The third ETSI NFV Plugtests event will be held between 29 May and 8 June, and the OPNFV Fraser Plugfest will be held from 4 to 8 June. 
The third NFV Plugtests event will focus on building and demonstrating complex Network Services that combine virtual network functions from different VNF providers and developers, while testing interoperability with MANO products across different platforms and sites. It will also exercise advanced NFV features like network and service automation. The sessions will demonstrate the ways in which multi-vendor combinations of NFV components can address 5G, edge computing and zero-touch network and service management use cases, and will expand the scope of NFV API testing to help progress the work on NFV conformance testing. 
OPNFV plugfests focus on interoperability of the OPNFV platform in deployment, network integration, VNF applications, and more. The event provides a platform for the community to work with hardware from both open source and commercial vendors and try out various combinations of components. 
The focus of the next OPNFV plugfest will be on the Fraser release as well as developer design sessions for topics related to testing, CI/CD, and future releases. Participation is open to any interested developers. During the last OPNFV plugfest, 4-8 December 2017, the focus was on the OPNFV Euphrates release and included discussion on contributing specific test cases for the combined ETSI/OPNFV plugfest in June.
