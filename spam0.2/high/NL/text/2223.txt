England slumped to their sixth lowest score in Tests on Thursday as they got bundled for a mere total of 58 on the first day of their first Test against New Zealand at Eden Park, Auckland. 
None of the English batsman to weather the storm from Trent Boult and Tim Southee and within just 20.4 overs and 93 minutes, the entire England team was back to the pavilion. 
Boult finished with a career-best figures of 6/32 while Southee returned with figures of 4/25 and absolutely dismantled the English batting line-up. 
In a shocking turn of events on Thursday morning, only two English batsmen — Mark Stoneman (11) and Craig Overton (33) managed to reach the double figures while five batsmen got out for a duck — Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow, Moeen Ali and Stuart Broad. 
With a score of just 58, England posted their lowest ever total against New Zealand and it was also the lowest total posted at the Auckland ground, the lowest being 26 which was scored by New Zealand against England in 1955. 
The previous lowest totals posted by England are 45 (vs Australia in 1887), 46 (vs West Indies in 1994), 51 (vs West Indies in 2009), 52 (vs Australia in 1948) and 53 (vs Australia in 1888). 
New Zealand’s new-ball pair of Trent Boult and Tim Southee set about with their task right from the beginning and their lines and lengths were impeccable, which left the visitors gasping. 
Both of them didn’t have much alarming movements. The likes of Alastair Cook, Dawid Malan and Mark Stoneman fell prey for being tentative with their footwork. Joe Root and Chris Woakes got deliveries of top class, while Jonny Bairstow perished to a combination of a loose drive and a Southee brilliance. 
The manner in which England perished on a hard and grassy task at Eden Park means that England are well on the back foot in the first Test. ALSO READ
