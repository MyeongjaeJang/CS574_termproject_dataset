As the debate rages on over who is South Africa’s finest Hip Hop cat, Nasty C and Cassper Nyovest have now scored a vote each from one of the culture’s authority on the continent in M.I Abaga. 
The Nigerian rap veteran who is widely regarded to as The Chairman recently had a Twitterview with The Basement Gig where he answered a lot of questions about the game. 
However, one question stood out in particular during the interactive and it couldn’t have been more direct – #BasementGig Your top 5 rapper in Africa pls? 
Considering the weight of the question, M.I tactically had to break it down into two aisles where he listed his finest rappers on the African continent of all time as well as those flying the flag at the moment. 
He replied: 
“Damn.. at the moment??? Or all time? 
AT- mode, proverb, jags, freestyle, ghost. 
RN- nastyC, Caasper, Poe, Ghost, Khaligraph .. 
Damn this list too hard I fxked it up #thebasementgig” 
That two of South Africa’s best Hip Hop figures made the list isn’t surprising considering the high esteem which M.I Abaga holds the industry in SA; even criticising his colleagues in Nigeria with the song “You Rappers Should Fix Up You Life.” 
It will also be recalled that Cassper Nyovest scored a feature on M.I Abaga’s recently released “Rendezvouz” album on the track “Soup.”
