The head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, has publicized a video from the village of Benoi showing Shaa Turlaev, announced wanted on suspicion of high-profile murders and murder attempts. Kadyrov has treated Turlaev as "the best of the best." 
Shaa Turlaev, also known as named "Sedoi" (Grey-Haired) was one of the key figures in the years of the First and Second Chechen Wars. In 2004, he surrendered under Kadyrov's guarantees and was amnestied. His name was mentioned in connection with a number of high-profile murders and murder attempts, including the killing of Umar Israilov, a former Kadyrov's security, and the attempt on Isa Yamadaev, Kadyrov's enemy. 
Kadyrov posted the video in his page of the "VKontakte" social network. After the views of Benoi's landscapes and a rich tableful, several men appear in the video. Kadyrov openly names Magomed Khambiev and Shaa Turlaev among them. 
The "Novaya Gazeta" writes that the latest active operative-search actions against Turlaev were conducted in 2014 in connection with the attempt on Saigidpasha Umakhanov. 
Shaa Turlaev is not the only one, who was noticed at large in Chechnya, despite his search under criminal charges, including murders. Thus, in November 2015, according to the calculations made by the "Caucasian Knot" , it was known about at least nine resonant criminal cases, the figurants of which were hiding in Chechnya .
