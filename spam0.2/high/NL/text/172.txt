Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) will provide equity financing to Inpex’s Caspian Sea subsidiary Inpex North Caspian Sea (INCS), which holds a 7.56% equity interest in the Kashagan project. JOGMEC has approved an investment of 60 billion Japanese yen, or around 566 million U.S. dollars. 
Located in the Kazakhstan sector of the Caspian Sea, the Kashagan field with approximately 9-13 billion barrels of recoverable oil, is one of the world’s largest discovery in the past four decades. It has been in production since late 2016. 
The Kashagan project is operated by North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC), on behalf of a consortium of national and international oil companies including INPEX. 
Since the establishment of INCS in 1998, JOGMEC, as Japan National Oil Corporation until 2005, has been continuing its financial supports to INCS, including equity investment covering exploration expenditures and guarantee for the initial development loan. 
“Grant of JOGMEC development equity finance will allow INCS to raise the capital required for further Kashagan development to boost production. This is the first-ever development investment since the amendment of the JOGMEC Law enacted in November 2016 where JOGMEC functions were enhanced to enable it,” JOGMEC said. 
The Phase I development, or the Experimental Program, is still underway to ramp up oil production to a capacity of 370,000 barrels per day at the earliest possible. Beyond the Experimental Program, NCOC plans future development phases to gradually and significantly increase output volumes. 
“JOGMEC’s continued support to INCS will contribute to diversifying and increasing crude supply to Japan for a longer time through the further expansion of giant Kashagan,” JOGMEC said. Share this article
