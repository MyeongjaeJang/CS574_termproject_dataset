The share of Dutch people accessing government websites rose to 73 percent in 2017 from 69 percent a year earlier, according to the statistics bureau CBS. This puts the country among the top-5 e-government adopters in the EU and ahead of the EU average of 49 percent. 
A total of 10.7 million Dutch people aged 12 or older visited government websites at least once last year. Around two-thirds were searching for information, almost half downloaded a document and just over half filed a document online with public authorities.
