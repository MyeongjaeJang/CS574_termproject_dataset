St Michael’s duo secure Bristol bouts By irishboxing   
St Michael’s Inchicore stablemates Cillian Reardon and Victor Rabei will fight for the second time this year and for the first time outside of Ireland on the same card next month. 
The Stillorgan middleweight and Moldovan-born lightweight will trade leather against a yet to be confirmed opponent in Bristol on Saturday April 21st. 
Rabei [4(1)-0] goes into the clash off the back of a career-best performance on the Last Man Standing undercard earlier this month.

The undefeated prospect had predicted some travel time in 2018 after he linked up with Assassin Promotions and seems genuinely excited to get some on the road experience. 
Reardon [1(0)-0] will just be delighted to be out again. The middleweight debuted on that Last Man Standing card after seeing a number of fights fall through last minute and will be more than content with a chance to double his number of wins so soon. 
The Leinster Rugby strength and conditioning chief had to debut against a last-minute cruiserweight in Istavan Orsos and impressed. Fight fans will be interested to see how he performs against someone his own size next time out. 
The Dynamite Pro Boxing ‘Battle on the Beach’ card at the Winter Gardens in just over four weeks time will also include Pawel August, Dean Dodge, Jake Best, Faheem Khan, John Winters, Dan Sabastonelli, Liam Hunt, and Tyler Davies. Share this:
