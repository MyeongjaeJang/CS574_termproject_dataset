Share on: google + With the World Cup nearing, Nike is getting everyone in order in terms of kits and boots – none more so than Cristiano Ronaldo. His latest signature boots have been unveiled – and they’ve been getting attention at Portugal training this week… These are Chapter 6 in the series of seven CR7 boots, with each telling a story about a stage in his career. This latest chapter focuses on Ronaldo’s role as the captain of his nation, thus the palette of the boot complementing Portugal’s traditional colours so well. A tribute to Portugal’s historical sea exploration lies both within the Swoosh and on the lateral side of the heel, whilst the captain’s “C” is incorporated into a raised applique of the sphere as Nike put attention to detail for their star player. With only one chapter left, Ronaldo will be hoping that he writes a new tale in Russia this summer, as Portugal begin their preparations with friendlies against Egypt and the Netherlands. It is here where these boots will be debuted, looking great amongst a new-look Portugal , too.
