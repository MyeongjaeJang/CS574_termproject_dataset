Los Angeles Publishing Company dedicated to helping business owners and entrepreneurs become the hunted with their best-selling books. Who is Donald Hamilton? He is a man who has learned by pushing through fire. He was homeless as a child, fatherless and close to being motherless. Eventually Donnys sisters came along, and he quickly learned the art of protecting those he loved. Donny had a tumultuous inner city upbringing; raised around drugs, biker gangs, alcoholics, and hardened criminals. Its not at all a stretch to say that he was being groomed for the penitentiary, rather than what is commonly indicative of success.
