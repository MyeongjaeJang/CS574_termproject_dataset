Paraguay has brought forward its analogue switchoff from 2024 to the end of 2020, reports La Nacion, citing National Telecommunications Commission (Conatel) head Teresita Palacios. The watchdog raised PYG 4 billion from the first tender for two DTT channels, pledging to use part of the funds raised to acquire set-top boxes for low-income households. A number of channels are already transmitting in digital and analogue signals ahead of the switchover, including Paraguay TV, Telefuturo, Noticias PY, RCP and Unicanal, said the report. Paraguay formally adopted the Japanese-Brazilian digital TV system (ISDB-T) back in 2010.
