23 March 2018, 00:13 "Golos" presents new data on violations in Southern Russia 
In Dagestan and Karachay-Cherkessia, observers videoed much more violations at the presidential election than those in Chechnya, said Vitaly Averin, the coordinator of the "Golos" (Vote) movement in the regions of Southern Russia. 
The "Caucasian Knot" has reported that six out of the 13 polling stations, where the voting outcomes were cancelled, are in Southern Russia. 
Andrei Illarionov, an economist, has treated the political culture in Karachay-Cherkessia and Dagestan as completely corrupt one . 
Observers from Dagestan sent to the "Violations Map" a total of 54 violation reports. In particular, one video shows a man forcing a pile of ballot papers into the ballot box. 
Kabardino-Balkaria showed the largest number of votes for Vladimir Putin (93.38%) in Russia. Chechnya lost its traditional leadership and was the runner-up (91.44% of votes).
