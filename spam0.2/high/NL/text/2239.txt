Sol picks Riverbed SD-WAN, cloud networking platform Wednesday 21 March 2018 | 16:19 CET | News Riverbed Technology announced that The Sol Group, an independent supplier of petroleum-based products to the Caribbean basin, is using Riverbed SteelConnect to connect 40 branch offices in 23 countries throughout the region. SteelConnect is a software-defined wide area networking (SD-WAN) and cloud networking platform that provides all branch and local offices with fast and secure access to the company’s centralised business applications, and is helping accelerate Sol’s adoption of cloud-based, software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. 
Riverbed said its SteelConnect platform reduces the management complexity posed by the variety of connectivity options Sol uses in its hybrid network across the Caribbean, which include MPLS, internet and mobile. Sol plans to soon expand the use of SteelConnect to other business segments in its network.
