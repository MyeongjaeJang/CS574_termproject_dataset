Slovak Telekom announced an update to the firmware of its Magio Box for IPTV to offer a simpler and more attractive user interface. The intuitive menu with a new layout will enable quick access to recordings, the TV archive and video library. The new Magio portal will offer TV tips, news, weather and other useful information. Customers will also get quicker access to the Archive, directly from the main menu. 
In addition, the Magio video library will include film trailers, alongside the brief content description. 
The new interface also brings simplified setup options, easier replay, thumbnail images for programmes and a more transparent display of series in the video library. 
Slovak Telekom will roll out the new features gradually for all IPTV customers in the coming weeks. The update will be done by automatic restart.
