Etisalat to deliver whole-home Wi-Fi service in UAE   08:25 CET | News 
UAE operator Etisalat has announced the launch of a Wi-Fi service designed to deliver reliable connectivity when deployed in every room. Called HomeZone, it creates a strong, reliable signal to help eliminate dead spots. For AED 29 per month, users will receive new access points to boost their Wi-Fi coverage in up to three extra zones. 
The complete package provides high-end Wi-Fi hardware, Ethernet cabling to the access point as well as all labour. The service is for a two-year period with no upfront payments. Customers have the flexibility of adding extra rooms, at any time, for a monthly charge of AED 29 per room. 
Etisalatâ€™s field engineers will carry out a comprehensive Home Wi-Fi survey with the customer to ensure any extra Wi-Fi coverage can be delivered. The Wi-Fi survey is free during all new eLife installations and for those shifting their existing eLife connection to a new home. Survey visits typically cost AED150. However, this is waived if customers proceed with the HomeZone installation.
