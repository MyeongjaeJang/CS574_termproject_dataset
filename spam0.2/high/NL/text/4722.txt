Liquid Telecom Kenya connects rural road agency offices   10:35 CET | News 
Liquid Telecom Kenya said it is connecting the Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA) headquarters to all 47 of its regional offices over the next two weeks. Access to high-speed internet will accelerate road bidding and commissioning and reduce costs for the agency. This will facilitate the complete digitisation of KeRRA's operation through an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform that will be accessible from all 47 regional offices and the HQ, and enhanced communication among branches through Voice over Internet (VoIP). 
KeRRA's 47 regional offices will be connected to a Wide Area Network on MPLS with a 2 Mbps capacity, while the headquarters will have an aggregated 40 Mbps internet link. The impact of the network on KeRRAâ€™s efficiency will be far-reaching, enabling the agency to access and identify the best-suited contractors for rural road building and renovations in just a few clicks after the closing of bidding. 
The new communications platform will also increase speed of decision making at the authority. It will be able to use functions such as video conferencing and VoIP to enhance and speed up information sharing.
