Then, in 1994, a 300ZX driven by Johnny O Connell, Steve Millen and John Morton took the overall win. 
Daytona . To win a major endurance race is amazing. These guys just did a great job and with flawless moves. The pit stops were great, the car performed, and Nissan did a fabulous job. We needed this. Virgin Australia Supercars Championship, Symmons Plains Raceway, Tasmania, Australia
