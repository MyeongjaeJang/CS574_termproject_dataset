Orange Bank starts offering personal loans Monday 26 March 2018 | 15:37 CET | News 
Orange Bank announced that its customers can now apply for personal loans, ranging from EUR 500 and EUR 75,000, using the bankâ€™s mobile app. The loans, offered with optional loan insurance, have repayment periods of between 12 and 120 months, and can be personalised at no extra cost. For example, customers have six months to activate the loan to suit their personal circumstances and are given the option to borrow a smaller sum than originally applied for. The bank service was launched in France in November 2017 and had signed up nearly 100,000 customers by early March.
