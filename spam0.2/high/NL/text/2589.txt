BaselWorld 2018 MeisterSinger Black Line versions of MeisterSinger classics 
New Black Line watches with a touch of ‘dramatic’. To achieve this effect, four MeisterSinger classics are coated with jet-black carbon and then sandblasted to provide a matt finish. 
The 43mm dials are also designed in matt jet black, Super-Luminova coating emanates a forceful glow. The length of the hand’s red segment precisely matches the geometry of the dial. The robust saddle leather straps underscore the energetic character of these new versions of the Automatic No.03 Black Line.
