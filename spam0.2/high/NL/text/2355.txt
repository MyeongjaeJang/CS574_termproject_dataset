ProSiebenSat.1, RTL and United Internet launch European NetID Foundation   11:08 CET | News 
Germany’s RTL Group, ProSiebenSat.1 and United Internet’s brands GMX and Web.de have set up the European NetID Foundation as part of their alliance for a single sign-on platform . The 'NetID' brand name should create an industry standard enabling every website in Europe to offer their users a safe log-in that conforms to EU data privacy laws, said ProSieben. 
With the NetID, users will be able to manage their data and change their password and opt-in out out of privacy settings in a standardized privacy center, said ProSieben. Around 50 million internet users in Germany will ultimately have access to this service, they said. The foundation said it will also work to develop industry standards.
