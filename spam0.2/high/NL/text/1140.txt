Vodafone launches 'What will you be?' digital skills and jobs initiative   10:34 CET | News 
Vodafone has announced the launch of an international future jobs programme dubbed "What will you be?" at an event in Brussels. The initiative, described as the largest of its kind in the world, is designed to provide career guidance and access to training content in the digital economy for up to 10 million young people across 18 countries. At the same time, the company pledged to double the number of opportunities offered to under-25s to join its existing graduate, apprenticeship, internship and work experience schemes worldwide, reaching a total of 100,000 by 2022. The two initiatives were announced to coincide with a Vodafone-commissioned survey revealing the extent to which young adults aged 18-24 believe they are ill-equipped to participate in the digital economy despite being the first generation to be "born digital". 
The operator has also worked with specialist psychologists, careers advisers and training providers to develop a smartphone-based service called the Future Jobs Finder that aims to offers young people a simple but comprehensive gateway to new skills and opportunities for employment in the digital economy. 
The service conducts a series of quick psychometric tests designed to identify each individual's aptitudes and interests and map them to the most appropriate job category in the digital economy. It then directs the individual to specific job opportunities in their chosen location as well as online digital skills training courses. Free Headlines in your E-mail
