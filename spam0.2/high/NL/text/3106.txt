22 March 2018, 15:29 Armenian authorities refuse to condemn brutal dispersal of protest after election 
As a result of the clashes, 10 people were killed and more than 250 others were injured. Out of 73 participants in the Armenian Parliament's meeting, only 10 voted in favour of the draft statement condemning the killing of demonstrators in Yerevan in 2008. The authorities will not benefit from any investigation into those events. This opinion was voiced by experts interviewed by the "Caucasian Knot" . 
Arthur Sakunts, the head of the Vanadzor Office of the Helsinki Civil Assembly, said that within a short time, a group of experts had collected more data on the illegitimacy of the law enforcers' actions than the entire law enforcement system during 10 years. 
"The group of experts became dangerous, and therefore it was disbanded," believes the rights defender. 
The events of March 1, 2008, are associated with the election of Serzh Sargsyan to the presidential post, and every statement about March 1 "causes discomfort of the power," suggests Boris Navasardyan, the head of the Yerevan Press Club. 
A new impulse to the investigation into the events of 10 years ago may be given by the decision of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on the complaints filed by successors of the killed protestors, said ex-MP Aram Manukyan, the deputy chairman of the "Armenian National Congress". 
Let us remind you that on March 1 and 2, 2008, in Yerevan, clashes of protestors with the police took place after the dissolution of a rally organized by the opposition, not satisfied with the results of the presidential election. Then Serzh Sargsyan was elected the President.
