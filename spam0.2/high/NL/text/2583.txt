Organic milk, buttermilk and yoghurt from Dutch farms WEBWIRE   
Today, Campina presents a new range of daily-fresh organic dairy products: Campina Organic. The organic milk, buttermilk and yoghurt are produced in a sustainable way by Dutch farmers. Campina Organic is packed in a new climate-neutral packaging of organic material that can be fully recycled. Sustainable food production 
Campina Organic complies with the European regulations for organic food. Additionally, all 140 Dutch Campina Organic farmers are annually checked by inspectors of Skal, an independent organisation supervising the organic production in the Netherlands. The well-being of the animals and the environment are central at the farms, so the farmer provides good food, care and living conditions. The cows can act as naturally as possible and they go outside whenever the weather allows for it. The animals are fed organically grown feed that mainly originates from the neighbourhood. We are really proud to introduce Campina Organic: dairy domestically produced by Dutch farmer families. It is great to see the enthusiasm about the launch of Campina Organic of the farmers themselves. With this, we set a new standard and we will keep innovating in order to continue to fulfil the needs of our consumers, according to Marloes Schulte, Marketing Director FrieslandCampina Consumer Dairy Netherlands. Climate-neutral packaging for Campina Organic 
The new packaging of Campina Organic is guaranteed to be climate-neutral and can be fully recycled. The cap and the coating are made of certified polyethylene obtained from organic residual material.
