It’s no secret that Amber Rose and 21 Savage have been dating for a couple of months now. We caught wind that the two called it quits about two weeks ago, after Amber erased all the pictures of 21 from her Instagram, and unfollowed him as well. 
I sat down with Justin Sylvester today on @edailypop and spilled all the tea to him! Just as I was walking off set, I got an alert that Amber Rose confirmed on BigBoy in the morning that the tea was indeed true! 
Rose said “You know Big Boy, to be in a relationship, in general, is very difficult. To be famous and in a relationship is even more difficult.” 
She went on to talk about how 21 will always be in her heart and said that she would like them to be “able to be friends.”
