Two members of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia as well as a policeman died following a gunfight at Umjadwal village 20 kilometres west of El Radoom in South Darfur on Thursday. Two more policemen were wounded. 
The reasons for the exchange of gunfire between the police and militiamen is unclear, but witnesses confirmed that an additional joint force of police and army went to the scene and took control of the situation. 
The dead policeman was identified as Mohammed Ali. The wounded policemen, Mohamed Adam and Mohamed Yagoub, were taken to El Radoom hospital. 
Returnees arrested 
On Wednesday, the RSF arrested seven people from Kutum in North Darfur who were previously displaced but have voluntarily returned. The people were reportedly cleaning their farms. Herders reported that the returnees were cutting trees which is illegal according to the law. 
The seven detained include Mohamed Abdelkarim Osman, El Mahi Abdallah Ismael, and Adam Abdelshafi, and four others who are unnamed. All of them have been transferred to El Fasher.
