South African network provider Sqwidnet has signed a channel partnership agreement with SMME IOT, an ecosystem management systems and Internet of things (IOT) strategy provider, to connect 1 million devices within the next 3-5 years, reports ITWeb. SqwidNet says this partnership will allow the company to provide its proposition of low-cost, long-range, low-power modules and devices to the existing network of partners that SMME IOT services. 
SMME IOT, in alliance with Visiosoft (an IOT device-maker), has already installed just over 2 500 water meter reader units across the country. 
The analytics platform connected to these devices receives the consumption data every 30 minutes. These are active sites, that send data from the devices into a cloud platform. This data is then used to understand the consumption patterns of the area, resulting in responsible usage of water in various suburbs and communities. SMME IOT offers end-to-end solutions using leading technologies and sustainable partnerships to grow and support various businesses in South Africa.
