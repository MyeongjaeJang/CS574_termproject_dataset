Facebook apologises in newspaper ads, defends data collection practices Monday 26 March 2018 | 09:01 CET | News 
Facebook took out full-page ads in US and UK newspapers in recent days so CEO Mark Zuckerberg could issue an apology to users of the social networks over the company's role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The company was also forced to issue a statement defending its data-collection practices, following reports Facebook users trying to delete their accounts were caught unaware of the amount of data the social network had on them. 
The newspaper ads appeared in major papers such as The Sunday Times, Mail on Sunday, The Sunday Telegraph, the Washington Post and the papers that broke the scandal, The Observer and The New York Times. Zuckerbeg apologised in the ads for the breach of trust. 
Separately, Facebook issued a "fact check", after noting recent reports suggesting Facebook logs users' call and SMS history without their permission. The #DeleteFacebook started after the CA scandal has prompted some users to try to leave Facebook. They are prompted to only 'deactivate', rather than delete, their accounts, which means Facebook retains any user data it has collected. 
Facebook said call and text history was collected only after users opted in on Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. The data is used to help improve the Facebook experience and find and connect with contacts. Facebook said users have to expressly agree to use this feature and can turn it off in settings. No content of the communications is stored, and the data is not sold to third parties. Free Headlines in your E-mail
