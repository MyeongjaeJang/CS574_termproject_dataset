WASHING DC - 21 Mar 2018 US sanctions South Sudanese oil-related entities over crisis File photo: President Donald Trump 
The United States on Wednesday sanctioned 15 South Sudanese oil-related entities, saying they have been fueling the ongoing crisis in the world’s youngest nation. 
The State Department said in statement seen by Radio Tamazuj that South Sudan's government and "corrupt official actors" are using the revenue to purchase weapons, fund militias and undermine peace. 
“By placing these entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Entity List, the United States will impose a license requirement on all exports, re-exports, and transfers of any U.S.-origin items to those entities,” US Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in the statement. 
“We call on the region and broader international community to join us in limiting the financial flows that fuel the continuing violence in the country.” 
The United States government said the names of these specific entities will be published in the Federal Register on March 22. 
This is the latest attempt to hold accountable those accused of spoiling peace and commit human rights violations in South Sudan. 
South Sudan government officials could not immediately be reached for comment. 
In February, the Trump adminstration imposed an arms embargo on South Sudan. 
The Sentry, a group co-founded by actor George Clooney, accused South Sudan’s government in a recent report of funneling cash from the state-owned oil company Nilepet to militias accused of committing atrocities. Share this
