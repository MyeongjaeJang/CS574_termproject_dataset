Mammoet says the office in Bridgewater, Somerset will ensure timely mobilisation of equipment and a quick upscale if required, by providing customers with immediate access to Mammoet's specialist equipment and professionals. 
Mammoet's UK managing director, Matthew Gent, said the new office reflects the company's long-term commitment to providing a complete range of heavy lifting, installation and transportation solutions to the project. 
He added: "The facility ensures Mammoet is well positioned to support the specific needs of the project more efficiently across the plant's lifetime." 
Lifting and material handling equipment specialist, Tusk Lifting, will also have a base at the Mammoet UK site. 
Mammoet described Tusk, which specialises in the hire, sales, service, inspection and testing of lifting and material handing equipment, as the ideal partner to complement its new facility. 
The opening of the Bridgewater office follows Mammoet's plans to invest GBP7.2 million (USD9.9 million) into a state-of-the-art base in the northeast of the UK, as HLPFI reported here . The six acre (2.43 ha) site will house 180 of its UK employees on the Teesside Estate, near Stockton.
