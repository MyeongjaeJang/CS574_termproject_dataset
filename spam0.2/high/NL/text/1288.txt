Share on: google + adidas has come with a classic design for the Red Devils ahead of the World Cup, recut for a new era. Inspired by the amazing and iconic diamond graphic shirt of 1984, Belgium’s current crop of stars – their golden generation – will be wearing a smart new jersey with a reference to one of the most stylish kits of all time. And it really is so 1980s, looking like a staple piece of fashion from back in those days across the chest of Hazard, De Bruyne and company. However, this is still one of the most futuristic shirts from adidas, too. The sweat-wicking shirt has a ribbed V-neck and a woven team badge on the chest, with a breathable and lightweight feel that the modern footballer expects. Things have changed a lot since 1984, least of all for Belgium who these days enter international tournaments among the favourites. 
In addition, a smart subtly striped yellow away jersey is available, too, as the Red Devils are set to be one of the better-dressed teams at the tournament. ‘Lifestyle items’ are also available that the team will be sporting as they relax and ready themselves in between games, with a polo, a track top and an ‘Anthem Jacket’ that they’ll rock on the pitch just before kick-off. What else is nice is that adidas is dedicated to creating products in ways that minimise their environmental impact. As such, the jersey is made with recycled polyester to save resources and decrease emissions. A smart move from a company who are embarking on yet another World Cup where their iconic three stripes will be seen across some of the best teams in the world. All of this Belgium gear is available to buy from adidas.com.
