by GregHarmon The legendary filmmaker announced plans for the fifth Indiana Jones installment at Rakuten TV's Empire Awards Show. 
While taking a breather from Ready Player One's promotional tour, filmmaker Steven Spielberg flew across the pond to accept Empire magazine's Legend of our Lifetime Award presented by Rakuten TV. The 71-year-old legend walked out to John Williams' timeless Indiana Jones theme song shortly after Simon Pegg presented the award. 
Fitting, since Spielberg announced during his acceptance speech that a fifth Indiana Jones installment will begin shooting in the UK this time next year (2019). While complimenting collaborators in the British film industry, Spielberg shared “It’s always worth the trip when I get to work with this deep bench of talent coming out of the UK. The actors, and the crew, the chippies, the sparks, the drivers — everybody who has helped me make my movies here, and will continue helping me make my movies here when I come back in April 2019 to make the fifth Indiana Jones movie right here.” 
The Indiana Jones franchise started in 1981, and the most recent film -Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull- released ten years ago in 2008 through Paramount Pictures. Despite Crystal Skull's mixed response, rumors of a fifth Indiana Jones film have surfaced ever since Disney acquired Lucasfilm back in 2012. 
Spielberg, who directed all four previous “Indy” installments, essentially confirmed Harrison Ford's return back in 2015 with Screen International : “I don’t think anyone could replace Harrison as Indy, I don’t think that’s ever going to happen,” he says. “It’s certainly not my intention to ever have another actor step into his shoes in the way there have been many actors that have played Spider-Man or Batman. There is only going to be one actor playing Indiana Jones, and that’s Harrison Ford.” 
Ford will be 76 by the time cameras roll in 2019. Any suggestions as to who Dr. Jones should pass the proverbial torch to?
