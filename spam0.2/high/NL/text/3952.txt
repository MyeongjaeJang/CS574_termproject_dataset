‘Will & Grace’ revival renewed for a third season 
The Will & Grace revival has officially been renewed for another season. 
The acclaimed comedy show has been picked up for a third season before the first season has finished and the second season, which was ordered last year, has aired. 
According to Deadline , the news was announced by the cast of the show at the PaleyFest television festival in Los Angeles yesterday (March 17) where show writer David Kohan revealed that the revival’s second season had been extended by five episodes to 18. 
Then, Eric McCormack, who plays Will in the show, reminded Kohan that there was even more exciting news and that the show is coming back for a third season consisting of 18 episodes. 
In a statement, NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt said: “As far as I’m concerned, we can’t get enough of Will & Grace and 23 more episodes is music to my ears. We’re eternally grateful that Debra, Eric, Sean and Megan feel the same way and wanted to keep this going.” 
He continued: “I’m overwhelmed by the euphoric response the new show has received from the press and the audience, and my hat is off to the unrivalled writing team of Max Mutchnick and David Kohan, as well as the brilliant directing of Jimmy Burrows, for consistently delivering one of the best shows on television.” 
The revival of Will & Grace has already featured a number of celebrity guests including Jennifer Lopez, who made a return to the show this month. Meanwhile, American Horror Story actor Cheyenne Jackson will also guest star in an episode.
