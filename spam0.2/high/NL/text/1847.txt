Verdi launches strikes at Deutsche Telekom as wage negotiations continue  07 CET | News Germany’s union for the service sector Verdi has launched another round of warning strikes at Deutsche Telekom as negotiations between the two parties failed to reach an agreement on annual wage increases, reported German business publication WirtschaftsWoche (WiWo). 
Roughly 3,500 Telekom employees from the customer service, sales force and technical repair services went on strike 20 and 21 March shortly before the third round of wage negotiations were set to begin, said Verdi’s head of industrial disputes Peter Praikow. Telekom employees went on strike throughout Germany with the exception of the states of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. 
Verdi is demanding a 5.5 percent wage increase for 55,000 Telekom employees as well as a EUR 75 monthly pay increase for apprentices and dual students, or an increase of 7.5 to 8 percent, wrote WiWo. But Telekom has not submitted an offer of its own during the previous two rounds of collective bargaining negotiations. 
Employee strikes will likely continue into 22 March when the third round of negotiations are set to end, wrote WiWo. A breakthrough in the talks is considered unlikely, however, and a fourth round of negotiations has already been scheduled for 11 and 12 April in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), they added.
