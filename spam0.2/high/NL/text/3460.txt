A piece of musical history today: the album Satori (1971) by the Flower Travellin’ Band , here performed live some ten years ago by the group of distinguished elderly gentlemen the band is today. 
This one’s been hiding on my iPod for a few years until it passed me by while I was working on something and it struck me what a genius piece of soaring, sensational metal-psychedelica this is. An eclectic mix of traditional and modern music styles from both the East and the West. This is kind of like a Peer Gynt of rock music. 
Director Takashi Miike, he of Ichi the Killer and Audition , used the complete album for his 2002 movie Deadly Outlaw: Rekka almost twenty years after it’s release.
