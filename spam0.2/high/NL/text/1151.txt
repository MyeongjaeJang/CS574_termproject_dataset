Line Mobile, SoftBank execute capital alliance to boost Line MVNO business   14:38 CET | News Line Mobile, a subsidiary of Line Corporation, and Japan-based SoftBank have executed a capital alliance to develop the ‘Line Mobile’ MVNO business operated by Line Mobile. Under the capital alliance, SoftBank will underwrite a third-party allocation of new shares to increase Line Mobile’s capital. The two parties have also entered a partnership agreement to promote the MVNO business. The investment ratio after the capital increase will be 51 percent SoftBank, and 49 percent Line. 
Line Mobile's representative director and president will continue to be Ayano Kado. Since its service launch in September 2016, Line Mobile has been offering price plans that subscribers can choose from based on how they generally use their smartphone. Depending on the plan, users have unlimited data allowance when using Line and other popular social media platforms, and Line's own music streaming service dubbed ‘Line Music’. 
The aim of the latest capital alliance and partnership with SoftBank is to further grow the Line Mobile service, and accelerate the expansion of the business. Line Mobile plans to reinforce its connections with the Line app, and apply SoftBank's know-how as a telecommunications business operator to expand its customer base by performing marketing and analyzing the telco market and its customers, establishing a distribution infrastructure, offering more devices. 
As a first step, Line Mobile plans to offer a service that operates on the SoftBank network starting this summer. Current Line Mobile customers will be able to continue using the service on the Docomo network. Line plans to make a separate announcement regarding details on service updates and other new initiatives once preparations are completed.
