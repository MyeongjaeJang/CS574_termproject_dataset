Share on: google + A lot of brands and national teams are releasing their kits ahead of the World Cup finals in June, but few have done it in such style as Nike and Portugal. Much of this collection is inspired by their success at Euro 2016, where they overcame the odds to become the winners of that tournament in France. The home and away shirts are smart in their own right, with tributes to the nation’s naval history involved. However, nicer still is the selection of casual attire released here – not to mention the lookbook to show it off. Have a look: Highlights like the beautifully buttoned polo shirt, show how football can transcend sport into fashion – something we’re into here at LAF. You’ll be able to cop some of these pieces next month from Nike.com.
