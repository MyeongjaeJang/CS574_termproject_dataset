Rostelecom to close its subsidiary Magalascacom   13:47 CET | News 
Russian national operator Rostelecom plans to liquidate its subsidiary Magalascacom, reports Comnews.ru. Until 2016, Magalascacom was a joint venture by Rostelecom and AT&T unit Alascacom, but AT&T then sold its 50 percent stake to Rostelecom. 
The management board of Rostelecom has already approved the liquidation. The scope of the business has not been able to cover its expenses. Magalascacom focused on the satellite connectivity between Russia and the US but it lost its importance after the deployment of a fibre-optic line to Magadan.
