United Internet FY results up on acquisitions, sees further growth in 2018   10:45 CET | News 
Germany's United Internet reported a strong increase in full-year results, in line with its outlook, thanks to its merger of telecom operator 1&1 with Drillisch . Revenues rose 10.5 percent to EUR 4.21 billion, and EBITDA was up 17.3 percent to EUR 980 million. United Internet forecast further growth in 2018, to sales of EUR 5.2 billion and EBITDA of EUR 1.2 billion, helped by an increase focus on smartphone sales. 
Revenue growth was also helped by the acquisitions of Strato and ProfitBricks last year, offset by negative currency and regulatory effects (roaming and termination fees), the company said. The acquisitions added EUR 337 million in revenue, while the negative effect from regulation was estimated at EUR 44.5 million. 
Valuation gains from the takeovers also added EUR 273.7 million to EBITDA. This was offset at the EBIT line by trademark writedowns of EUR 20.7 million, as well as purchase price amortisation for the acquisitions. Along with extra financing costs for the Drillisch deal, an impairment on the stake in Rocket Internet and one-off tax effects from the Warburg Pincus investment in the Business Applications division, the company grew EPS from continued operations to EUR 3.38 in 2017 from EUR 2.27 a year earlier. This supports an increase in the dividend to EUR 0.85 per share from EUR 0.80. 
The outlook for 2018 includes an expected positive effect on revenue of EUR 200 million from the adoption of IFRS 15 accounting standards on subsidised handset sales. The effect is expected to be neutral on EBITDA. The Drillisch merger should contribute synergies of EUR 50 million at the EBITDA level in 2018, driven by cooperation on wholesale network access and smartphone procurement. This will be offset by an expected EUR 50 million increase in marketing spend and optimisation of ad monetisation at GMX and Web.de. In addition, the EBITDA forecast includes around EUR 50 million in one-off expenses for integration projects. 
United Internet said it aims to add around 1.2 million new DSL and mobile internet contracts in 2018. That follows contract net additions of 5.22 million in 2017, mainly due to acquisitions but also 0.88 million organic additions. The company finished 2017 with a total of 22.89 million paid contracts. Growth in 2018 will be driven by coordinated branding, increased marketing budgets, and much greater use of subsidized smartphones (mostly without upfront payment), also sold via GMX and Web.de and the 1&1 Drillisch discount brands (smartmobil.de, yourfone, winSIM etc.). Further growth is also anticipated for the Business Access and Business Applications divisions in 2018, the company said.
