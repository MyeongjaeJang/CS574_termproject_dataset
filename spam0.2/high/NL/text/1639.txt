Telefonica, Huawei team up to create enterprise Big Data portfolio   10:57 CET | News 
Telefonica has announced a partnership with Huawei to launch a set of Big Data products aimed at businesses that want to develop their own internal use cases and sell data applications to their clients. The new Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) products will be marketed under Telefonica’s Big Data brand Luca and will initially be made available over the operator’s cloud infrastructure in Latin America. 
Under the terms of the partnership, Telefonica and Huawei will provide business customers with four core services, including the Hortonworks data platform as a service to help store, process and analyse data, “Big Data Integration” to migrate data to the cloud, “Data Governance” to control the quality and security of data, and “Data Miner” to help create insights from data through analytical algorithms and complex structured and unstructured data integration. 
Each of the services can be self-deployed for use by the customer on-demand and can be rolled out over a variety of Infrastructure-as-a-Service environments, said the partners, adding that this method of providing services on-demand is designed to help customers avoid long hardware procurement cycles and large investments as well as reduce the time-to-market. Telefonica and Huawei said the Big Data product suite will be soon expanded with new services. The agreement also provides for the future launch of an application market where partners can sell their big data and analytics applications to customers.
