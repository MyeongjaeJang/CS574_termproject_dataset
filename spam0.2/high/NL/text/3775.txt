Kottayam: The anti wetland filling campaign ‘Vayalkiligal’ got overwhelming support for its fight today. 
Senior leaders of different political parties took part in the second phase of the campaign. The shed of the protesters, destroyed by CPM activists, was set up afresh. 
Congress leader V M Sudheeran, actor turned BJP leader Suresh Gopi, MP, firebrand leader P C George, MLA, popular environmentalist C R Neelakanthan, RMP leader Venu were among those who reached Thaliparamba in Kannur to take part in the march organised by Vayalkiligal. 
A 72-year-old social activist Nambradathu Janaki inaugurated the event. An emotional Janaki proclaimed that the strike will continue until the demands were met. 
Vayalkiligal leader Suresh Keezhatoor and others spoke. Hundreds of environmentalists and voluntary workers came from different parts of the state, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. 
Yesterday CPM district secretary P Jayarajan had cautioned CPM workers against taking to violence which would only reinforce the campaign that has lost its relevance. 
The protest was originally started by CPM as it was UDF government’s venture. Suresh Keezhatoor was actively involved in the protests. 
After LDF came to power, the Communists conveniently dumped it. However, Suresh restarted it under the title ‘Vayalkiligal’ (farm birds) in 2017 against reclaiming paddy field for the Kannur bypass project. 
The government started acquiring land and many people surrendered their property. ALSO READ
