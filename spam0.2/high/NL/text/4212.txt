Almost 70 per cent of education professionals have said that they didn’t find it hard to secure their first job without any previous experience. 
According to a study of 1,200 professionals by CV-Library, 63 per cent did not take part in an internship or work experience before they started their first job. 
However, the majority (91.3 per cent) of education professionals think work experience is still important, with almost half (47.6 per cent) saying that it could help you decide whether a career path is right for you. 
A further 31 per cent believe that having experience on your CV shows potential employers that you’re motivated and passionate, and, over one in 10 (14.3 per cent) say it introduces you to the world of work. 
Lee Biggins founder and managing director of CV-Library comments: “We’re often told that work experience is vital for getting a job. So it’s interesting to see that education professionals were able to land their first role without any previous work experience. 
“However, it’s good to see that organisations are hiring candidates who might not have a great deal of work experience, particularly when younger professionals are trying to get their foot in the door.“
