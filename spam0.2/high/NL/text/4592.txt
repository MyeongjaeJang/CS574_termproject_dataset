Heimatwein by NH Hotels: all the flavour of the homeland in the hotel Eighteen terroir wines created exclusively with fifteen German winegrowers WEBWIRE – Monday, March 26, 2018 
For wine lovers in general, and for those who wish to discover the world of German wines in particular, NH Hotel Group has designed what is proving to be a real wine event: Heimatwein by NH Hotels. From the beginning of February, up to 18 exclusive white, rosé and red wines, bottled especially for NH Hotel Group, can be enjoyed at NH hotels throughout Germany. 
The wine menu has been drawn up in close collaboration with 15 winegrowers from the German wine-making regions of Baden-Wurttemberg, Rheinhessen, Rheingau, Franconia, Mosel and Palatinate. In making the selection, great consideration has been given to the regional character of each wine-maker, their concept of terroir and the history of the broths. Through Heimatwein, NH Hotel Group aligns itself with the current trend in favour of regional wines and offers relaxation and enjoyment to those who stay at its hotels, whether on a business trip or simply to get to know the city. 
With Heimatwein we bring a whole range of emerging growers and their wines to the urban setting. As hoteliers, we constantly strive to offer our guests unforgettable stays. Furthermore, German wine is undergoing a genuine renaissance thanks to the creativity and constant work of the growers. This has led to the idea to offer 15 of them the possibility of collaborating with us. The result: 18 marvellous wines, so that everyone who tastes them will feel transported to their own homeland , says Stefanie Schubert, Marketing, E-Commerce and Communication Director for the Business Unit Northern Europe NH Hotel Group. 
The history of German wine begins in Roman times. The Romans, who occupied Germania about 2,000 years ago - were passionate wine drinkers; so obviously even here in the far north they did not want to give up their beloved grape juice and in prevision of this brought some vines from their homeland beyond the Alps to us. Thanks to their wine-drinking today we enjoy a distinctive German wine landscape with more than 100,000 hectares of vineyards throughout the country, states Schubert 
In Heimatwein, the selected wineries includes rising stars such as Weingut Stefan Rinklin from Baden, Privatkellerei Hirsch from Wurttemberg and Weingut Hammel from the Palatinate. Christian and Juliane Hirsch are part of the Generation Riesling a lively platform for young German wine producers to reach audiences at both national and international levels. The wine menu prepared for the occasion provides information on the growers and each of the wines. Five of the wine producers participating in Heimatwein explain in brief portrayals what it means to them to know that they are children of their homeland. All the wines can also be acquired outside the hotels where the members of NH Rewards, the loyalty program of NH Hotel Group, will enjoy a special discount.
