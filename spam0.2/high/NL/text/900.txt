Kenyan operator Safaricom has connected Ngummo estate to its Fibre to the Home (FTTH) service in Nairobi County. The move will benefit more than 1,200 homes in Ngummo and Newa estates and brings the number of homes within reach of the service to more than 144,000 countrywide. To mark the milestone, residents in the estate and all other customers across the country will receive one month of free fibre connectivity with each new connection. 
New customers will also get free fibre installation services and a free Wi-Fi router. Safaricom has sought to distinguish its FTTH service by emphasising reliability and a dedicated customer support line on number 400 for existing customers and by dialing star 400 hash for those wishing to get connected.

For streaming, and moderate to heavy usage, customers can choose from a 10 Mbps Silver package, 20 Mbps Gold Package and 40 Mbps Platinum Package for KES 3,499, KES 4,999 and KES 9,999 respectively.
