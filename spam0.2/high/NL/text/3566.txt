CRTC to start consultation on lower-cost data-only plans for mobile services Friday 23 March 2018 | 11:27 CET | News The CRTC has started a consultation on lower-cost data-only plans, asking people and market parties to say what specific rules, if any, are needed to ensure these are widely available to the public. Bell Mobility, Rogers and Telus have been told to provide their proposals for lower-cost data-only plans by 23 April. The CRTC will then publish the proposals for public comment. 
The CRTC recently examined whether a range of mobile technologies, such as Wi-Fi access, could be used to improve the affordability of mobile services in Canada. The regulator concluded that there is a gap in the market for lower-cost data-only plans and that there could be more choice regarding innovative and affordable mobile services. As a result, the CRTC said it will be initiating a review of its wholesale mobile wireless framework within the next year. 
The consultation comes in response to a government order to reconsider a ruling on roaming access the regulator made a year ago. Globe and Mail explains that companies that do not build their own wireless networks cannot resell mobile services unless they can negotiate network access. To date, Canada's national carriers Rogers, Telus and BCE (Bell) have been unwilling to negotiate wireless reselling agreements on any broad basis. They argue thatbeing forced to open up their networks to players who don't build their own would discourage investment in communication investment. The CRTC has not ordered the big three to open their networks, though it did say it will review the situation, resorting instead to looking at the possibility of low-cost plans.
