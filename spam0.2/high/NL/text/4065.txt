Dont make the mistake of starting this book late at night, as I did because it is so well written and compelling that you will surely miss your bed time. The author takes time tested Chinese principles and explains them in easy to understand modern language. Now that I have read through the book I am going to take my time and enjoy going back to do the exercises (fun games). I can tell by reading through them that they will shed a lot of light on what is going on with me. I like the easy to follow steps to determine imbalance and the suggestions to restore balance. This book has left me wanting to learn more about the movements and meditations involved in Happy tai chi, and I hope there will be more in subsequent books.  Barbara Addison 
Great book! The author brings eastern wisdom to a western reader in an accessible way. I love the explanations of Qi as well as the Yin and the Yang. I was recently thinking about of the importance of balance in life to ones happiness and these explanations help bring understanding to what is balance and how to achieve this. There are great suggestions throughout the book, for instance specific suggestions for engine balance for different types of people (i.e. too yin or too yang). There are also constant reminders to be loving and kind as this is healing for ourselves and others. I love the authors enthusiasm for helping society by helping individuals.  Estee L.
