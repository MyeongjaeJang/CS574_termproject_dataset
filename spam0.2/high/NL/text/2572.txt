Written by DTVE Reporter 2 hours ago More than a quarter of consumers have cancelled a pay TV service in the past 12 months due to poor customer service, according to research by Paywizard. Bhavesh Vaghela The TV service payments company found that 26% of people surveyed had cancelled a service because of poor customer service, and that 44% of people who had a negative interaction or issue with an OTT provider had cancelled. Overall, 75% of respondents said they would cancel if service and support became poor and a provider seemed out of touch with their needs and preferences. On the other hand, 87% of consumers said they would be more loyal to a TV service provider that was proactive in ensuring their package and price are always at the best level for them. “Modern consumers, especially millennials coming of age in the era of big-data, expect pay TV providers to know them – and what’s more, with every interaction, reflect genuine insight into their habits, preferences and needs by acting on them,” said Paywizard CEO, Bhavesh Vaghela. “It is all too evident that too many pay TV operators are simply falling short in their efforts to build customer loyalty and brand reputation. The days when they could rely merely on the strength of their content offering are gone.” The research is based on a survey of more than 3,000 consumers across three markets – the UK, US and Philippines.
