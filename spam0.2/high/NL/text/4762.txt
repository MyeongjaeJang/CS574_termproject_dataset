Swedish broadband coordinators face challenges in mapping infrastructure   12:07 CET | News 
The Swedish Broadband Forum says that the national secretariat for regional broadband coordinators has published its report on their activities in 2017 . It found that cooperation has improved but only half of counties have an up-to-date map of fixed broadband infrastructure, with even fewer having current maps of mobile equipment. 
The report found that procedures for cooperation at regional and municipal level have been established in most parts of Sweden. More boroughs have their own,local coordinater, and exchanges of experiences are rising. 
Coordinators spent most of their time on cooperation, mapping, and supporting local councils in their work. Compared with 2016, time spent on coordination fell, but time spent on mapping rose somewhat. The secretariat has concluded that less time now needs to be spent on initiation stages. 
Only half of counties have an up-to-date map of fixed infrastructure, and even fewer have fully charted mobile broadband infrastructure. Coordinators say it can be difficult to obtain information from operators, and there is also a lack of resources and competence within their own organsations. They also refer to the need for common guidelines, more exchange of experiences, and support at national level for mapping. 
In most counties, cooperation among boroughs functions well, and every county has cooperation groups for municipal coordinators. Some counties focus on regional projects for broadband expansion.
