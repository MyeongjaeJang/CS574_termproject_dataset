Polish group Cyfrowy Polsat, controlled by Zygmunt Solorz-Zak, has been consolidating its mobile infrastructure within the company PL 2014, reported Rpkom.pl. In 2017, PL 2014 took over part of the assets of the company Aero2, part of former stock-listed company Midas, valued at PLN 509 million. Now, the assets which the mobile operator Polkomtel will transfer to PL 2014 are valued at PLN 1.69 billion; total net assets of Polkomtel's network Plus were valued at PLN 5.1 billion as of 01 January. 
PL 2014 will deal with construction, maintenance and lease of infrastructure, and the control package of shares will be held by Cyfrowy Polsat. PL 2014 will take over around 400 employees (378 employees of the network Plus and 23 from Aero2). 
The assets to be transferred to PL 2014 include infrastructure and devices, totalling 91,000 existing elements of various types and more than 7,700 elements under construction; contracts for the lease of real estate and infrastructure (more than 4,700 contracts, most of which are contracts with Orange Poland on access to cable ducts; around 11,000 contracts for rental and lease of land for construction of base stations, including other operators and Emitel; over 7,300 contracts for network maintenance; power supply; radio and construction permits, including taking up the road lane. 
Polkomtel will continue offering telecommunications services to retail and wholesale clients. 
Theoretically, the consolidation of the network may help in a possible later sale, or sharing or outsourcing the network's management, wrote Rpkom.pl. However, Cyfrowy Polsat has not confirmed those plans. 
According to Olga Zomer, spokeswoman of Cyfrowy Polsat, the integration of network assets in one company will allow more efficient network management. Historically, the assets were distributed in three companies - Polkomtel, Aero2 and Sferia. The company is 100-percent held by the capital group Cyfrowy Polsat. Free Headlines in your E-mail
