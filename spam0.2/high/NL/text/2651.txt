Extending water stewardship in North America WEBWIRE – Thursday, March 22, 2018 
In celebration of World Water Day, Nestlé Waters North America has announced that its remaining two factories in California, Cabazon and Los Angeles, have received certification against the rigorous Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Standard . 
All five of the companys water bottling facilities in California are now certified to the AWS Standard, a priority outlined by Nestlé Waters in late 2017. 
These recent certifications in California further prove that it is possible for sustainable freshwater use to be socially, environmentally, and economically responsible, said Matt Howard, Director for AWS North America. 
The programme is part of Nestlés global commitment to caring for water, supporting the companys 2030 ambition to strive for zero impact in its operations. 
This is an exceptional validation of our commitment to water and community stewardship, said Nelson Switzer, Chief Sustainability Officer at Nestlé Waters North America. We are committed to playing our part here in California, and wherever we operate, in protecting our shared water resources. 
The AWS Standard is the first comprehensive global standard for measuring responsible water stewardship, in terms of environmental criteria as well as social and economic dimensions.
