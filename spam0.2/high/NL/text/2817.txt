National security arrest senior Nilepet official over leaks File photo: Mark Mabil 
South Sudan’s National Security Service on Tuesday arrested the Deputy Head of Accounts of Nilepet for allegedly leaking secret information. Mark Mabil Awëër was picked and taken to NSS detention in Juba. 
His colleagues and relatives told Radio Tamazuj yesterday evening that the deputy head of accounts of Nilepet Company had been arrested for allegedly leaking top secret information on operational activities. 
“South Sudan security officials in Juba have arrested Nilepet deputy head of accounts, Mr Mark Mabil. The security accused him of leaking documents exposing corrupt dealings in the government-own corporate,” an official said. 
“Mabil is still in NSS detention,” he added. 
The official further said Mabil was interrogated by national security officials last week but he denied knowledge of the alleged leaked documents. 
A family member, who identified himself as Ayuen, said Mabil had been complaining that some officials at Nilepet have been conspiring against him with some elements from the national security service in order to put his life in danger and get rid of him. 
There is no response from the top management of Nilepet so far. 
The United States on Wednesday sanctioned on 15 South Sudanese oil-linked companies it said were substantial sources of revenues to fuel the ongoing civil war. 
Those on the list include the state-owned Nile Petroleum Company (Nilepet). Share this
