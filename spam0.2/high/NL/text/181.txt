Rocket Internet considers Jumia IPO â€“ report  33 CET | News 
German start-up investor Rocket Internet is exploring a stock market listing of loss-making African online shopping platform Jumia, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people close to the matter. The investor is expected to mandate banks shortly for an initial public offering of Jumia, , they added. Rocket Internet, which helped set up the company in 2012, is seeking an exit from the consumer electronics and fashion retailer, in line with its strategy of selling or listing established internet firms. 
According to Reuters, Berenberg, which has a track record of working with Rocket on capital market transactions, is seen to be in a good position to win a mandate, the people said. Listing shares in a volume of under EUR 200 million could take place in late 2018 or in 2019, either in Frankfurt or in London, one of the people said. No information on Jumia's valuation was immediately available. Rocket Internet declined to comment. 
Rocket Internet floated online food groups Delivery Hero and HelloFresh IN 2017, and the investor is currently preparing a flotation of its online furniture retailer Home24. Rocket Internet CEO Oliver Samwer told Reuters earlier in 2018 that the company needs to hold on to its mountain of cash so it can compete with rivals from the US and China and pounce when investment opportunities arise.
