Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (Nasdaq: CMTL) announced today that during its third quarter of fiscal 2018, its Orlando, Florida-based subsidiary, Comtech Systems, Inc., which is part of Comtech’s Government Solutions segment, has received an order totaling approximately $2.0 million to provide 50 Mb/s tactical troposcatter equipment to a leading supplier to the UAE Armed Forces. 
The Modular Transportable Transmission System (MTTS) troposcatter terminals purchased will be delivered to the UAE Armed Forces as a proof of concept vehicle to determine how the MTTS fits into their existing military communications scenario. Comtech’s advanced 50 MB tropo modem was chosen because of its excellent field record with both international customers and the U.S. Military, as well as the unmatched performance of the Comtech CS67500 modem. 
Fred Kornberg, President and Chief Executive Officer of Comtech Telecommunications Corp. commented, “This project shows the growing role of deployable troposcatter systems around the world, and their power to enable low-latency, high throughput data links across areas that are otherwise inaccessible due to geography or other factors. As the only modern field-proven deployable troposcatter system, Comtech’s MTTS is a natural choice for the UAE Armed Forces.” Related Research on ASDReports.com:
