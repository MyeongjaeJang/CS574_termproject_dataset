Vodacom SA told to take misleading 'split data' Tuesday 20 March 2018 | 12:39 CET | 
The Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa (ASA) has ruled against Vodacom for advertising data packages where only half of the data volume quoted is available at all times, reports BusinessTech. Vodacom’s print advert promoting its internet data packages, with packages between 4GB and 40GB, was at the centre of an ASA complaint. 
The complainant highlighted that only half of the data volume quoted is available at all times. The rest of the data is only available between midnight and 5.00 am 
Vodacom responded, saying “the takeout of an advertisement must be considered as a whole”. The complaint only refers to page thirty-nine of a booklet, whereas this page cannot be divorced from the preceding and adjacent page, namely page thirty-eight, said Vodacom. 
Vodacom said that a table which defines the data package allocations appears at the top of page thirty-eight, and the definition of the data allowances is stated. The ASA was not convinced, however, saying there is no heading or wording in Vodacom’s advertising which explains that its data package breakdown now applies to everything that follows. 
The table simply appears at the top of the page, with no context, said the ASA. It said the words ‘Night Owl’ do not appear anywhere on any of the packages that follow, drawing attention to the fact that this is a Night Owl offer.The ASA subsequently ruled against Vodacom’
