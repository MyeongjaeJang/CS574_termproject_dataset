For our DMV Bombshells stepping out this Sunday, March 25th for Conversations With Claire, D.C. get a few ideas on what to wear with today’s “Shiny Shoe” inspired style inspirations. 
Opt for a Spring inspired look in a light blue bomber jacket, graphic print cropped tee, and white tailored trousers. 
Complete the look with holographic and iridescent accents in a pair of leather pumps, a quilted leather shoulder bag, and gold-tone mirrored lens sunglasses. 
For a chic brunch inspired outfit, rock a slogan print sweatshirt offset by a color-block pink and white pleated midi skirt and silver sequin ankle boots. 
Toughen up the look with a leather biker jacket, black quilted belt bag, embellished oversize square-frame sunglasses, and silver logo earrings. 
Dress up a pair of black skinny jeans with an open shoulder ruffled poplin shirt and a black blazer. 
For the final touch, dress up the look with crystal embellished slouchy boots, a red mini chain shoulder bag, chandelier earrings, and a bold red lip. 
Shimmer in a glossy blush pink blazer and sequin graphic t-shirt paired with white high-waist skinny jeans. 
Pull the look together with a pair of sequin pumps, an embellished pink clutch, rose gold aviator sunglasses, and matching jewelry. 
And lastly, keep it comfy casual with a chic twist in an oversized applique hoodie styled with a silver sequin pencil skirt and a pair of glitter low-top sneakers. 
Add the finishing touch to this festive street style look with a zipper-detail denim jacket, a black leather pouch, and aviator shades.
