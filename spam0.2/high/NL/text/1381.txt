Today, at a picket "For Fair Elections" held in Volgograd, protestors have claimed that the number of votes given for Pavel Grudinin, a Russian presidential candidate from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF) is understated by falsifications. 
The " Caucasian Knot " has reported that on March 18, the voting took place at the presidential election in Russia . Volgograd Communists called the presidential election falsified . 
From 12:00 a.m. till 1:00 p.m. Moscow time, in the centre of Volgograd, a protest organized by the CPRF took place. In their hands, picketers were holding posters reading: "For Fair Elections!" and "No Falsification of Election Results!", the " Caucasian Knot " correspondent reports. 
A member of the CPRF's Volgograd Regional Committee informed the " Caucasian Knot " correspondent that the protest action was sanctioned for 100 people, and it was attended by 30. 
Today, the protest action organized by the CPRF is held throughout the whole country, the " Caucasian Knot " correspondent was informed by Andrei Shevchenko , the secretary of the CPRF's Volgograd Regional Committee, who took part in the picket. 
"If there were no lies in the media, no administrative resource, no violations on the election day, then the Pavel Grudinin's results would have been completely different: at least two or three times higher than reported. We filed complaints to various instances, including PECs (precinct election commissions), TECs (territorial election commissions), the Volgograd Regional Election Commission, the CEC (Central Election Commission), and the court. By holding our picket, we want to demonstrate our disagreement with the results of the election," Andrei Shevchenko noted.
