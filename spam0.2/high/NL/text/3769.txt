YEI/NASIR - 25 Mar 2018 Clashes break out between rival forces in truce violation 
Clashes have broken out in three states between government troops and rebels, government officials said on Sunday, the latest violation of a ceasefire deal signed in December last year. 
On Sunday, the army’s spokesman Lul Ruai Koang told Radio Tamazuj that the rebels launched coordinated attacks on their positions in Latjor, Yei River, and Fashoda States today morning. 
“They attacked us in an area called Kalageny in Fashoda and captured the area from our forces. The attack was carried out jointly by Machar’s forces and rebels loyal to Lam Akol,” he said. 
“The rebels also attacked us in the area of Sokari in Yei River State. They also came and attacked us in Dording and Wechtut in Latjore, but we fought in self-defense,” he said. 
Lul did not give details on casualties. 
Rebels under former first vice president Riek Machar denied Lul’s claims, saying instead the government forces this morning attacked them in the areas of Morsak and Sokare in Kajo-keji County of Yei River State. 
Rebel deputy spokesman Paul Lam Gabriel said fight was ongoing in Yei River State. 
“In Sobat state, the government attacked us attacked our forces in Dhording and Wechtut but they were repulsed in Wichtut, while fighting is still ongoing in Dhording,” he said. 
Lam called on the ceasefire monitoring body, also known as CTSAMM, to investigate the fighting. Share this
