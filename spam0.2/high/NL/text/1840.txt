German Farmers Association criticizes govt broadband strategy   15:10 CET | News The German Farmers Association has criticized the German government’s goal of attaining nationwide broadband coverage by 2025 as being "entirely insufficient" for the agricultural industry, reported German daily RP Online. The head of the association, Joachim Rukwied said the association sees opportunities in digitisation to introduce more environmentally friendly practices, like using GPS to more effectively employ crop protections. Rukwied said the government’s proposed subsidy fund of EUR 12 billion would not be enough to create the necessary investments in these technologies in rural areas.
