Bezeq warns for lower net profit in 2017 on DBS writedown   12:49 CET | News 
Israeli operator Bezeq said it expects to report 2017 net profit of about ILS 1.2 billion, down from its previous estimate of ILS 1.4 billion and flat compared with 2016 due to writedown on its satellite TV business. In its trading update, the operator said EBITDA is expected to be about ILS 3.8 billion, down from earlier guidance of ILS 4 billion, while the free cash flow forecast was increased slightly to ILS 2.1 billion from ILS 2.0 billion. 
The changes in the forecast for net profit and EBITDA are mainly due to an updated valuation for DBS Satellite Services. After a valuation of DBS by an external assessor, the company has decided to write down the book value of the subsidiary, mainly due to the difficult market for pay-TV services. At the new value of ILS 1.350 billion, the company will write down goodwill by ILS 90 million, resulting in a corresponding decrease in the expected profit. Free Headlines in your E-mail
