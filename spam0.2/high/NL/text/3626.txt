1.7 to 10.8 0.008 B unstandardized regression coefficient, SE standard error of the coefficient, Standardized B standardized coefficient, 95% CI 95% confidence interval, BSA body surface area, LVEDV LV end diastolic volume Discussion To our knowledge this is the first and largest study assessing comprehensive measures of cardiac and hemodynamic function at rest and during incremental exercise to maximal exertion as determinants of exercise capacity in people with T1DM and T2DM, relative to matched controls. We observed lower \(\dot{V}O_{2}\) peak in T2DM subjects and determined that 80% of the variance in \(\dot{V}O_{2}\) peak in the overall cohort was explained by cardiac size (lower resting LVEDV), the amount of habitual exercise and T2DM, in addition to demographic factors age, sex and BSA. Conversely, there was no evidence of lower exercise performance in the T1DM cohort despite a lengthy duration of diabetes and suboptimal glycemic control. In both diabetes subgroups, there was no evidence of biventricular systolic dysfunction or impaired LV diastolic function at rest or during exercise relative to their matched controls. Hyperglycemia does not explain reductions in \(\dot{V}O_{2}\) peak Chronic hyperglycemia is associated with endothelial dysfunction and microvascular disease, and a causal link with   (CHF) and reduced exercise capacity [ 2 ] has been proposed. In contrast to previous investigations [ 13 , 14 ], we observed a significant inverse correlation between HbA1c and \(\dot{V}O_{2}\) peak in our cohort. However, this association was largely abolished when other confounding factors such as diabetic status, age and sex were included in the multivariate model. It may be argued that the associations between hyperglycemia and exercise capacity are best explored in T1DM rather than T2DM subjects given the lower prevalence of other confounding factors such as obesity, additional cardiovascular risk factors and lower exercise participation. Most studies have failed to identify a clear link between glycemic control and exercise capacity [ 15 , 16 ], with the exception of Baldi et al. [ 17 ]. Baldi compared a group of 12 T1DM endurance triathletes with matched controls and whilst there was no difference in exercise capacity, the 6 T1DM athletes with worse glycemic control (mean HbA1c = 62 mmol/mol) had 15% lower \(\dot{V}O_{2}\) peak than the six athletes with better control (mean HbA1c = 48 mmol/mol). The degree to which these differences can be accounted for by hyperglycemia as opposed to confounding behavioral and health factors is difficult to quantify. The data presented here suggests that once multiple factors are considered, the influence of glycemic control on exercise capacity is, at most, modest. An absence of subclinical cardiac dysfunction A higher incidence of   (CHF) has been observed in diabetes subjects [ 18 , 19 ], leading to the concept of a diabetes-specific cardiomyopathy [ 2 ]. Diabetic cardiomyopathy has evolved into a specific clinical entity with two distinct phenotypes proposed: heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) [ 2 ]. Furthermore, Widya et al. [ 20 ] have reported changes in the right ventricle that parallel those seen in the left ventricle in T2DM subjects. On the other hand, the entity of diabetic cardiomyopathy remains contentious amongst some given the dependence of small animal and molecular models rather than prospective human data [ 6 , 21 ]. A high prevalence of LV diastolic dysfunction has been observed in T2DM [ 22 , 23 ] and its association with impaired exercise capacity has been suggested to represent a subclinical phase of diabetic cardiomyopathy [ 24 , 25 ]. In the present study, we found no difference in the prevalence of diastolic dysfunction between the T2DM group and their controls. Interestingly, the four T2DM subjects identified to have diastolic dysfunction at rest had normal diastolic stress test results. Similarly, there were no differences in the change of LVEDV during exercise when DM subjects were compared with matched controls (Fig. 3 ). These findings strengthen the argument that diastolic dysfunction was not the cause for the reduced \(\dot{V}O_{2}\) peak. There were also no significant differences in LV or RV systolic function to explain the lower \(\dot{V}O_{2}\) peak. Subjects with reduced LVEF were excluded from participating in our study, and the mean LVEF in the total cohort was 60 ± 5%. Reductions in newer echocardiographic measures of LV systolic function such as global longitudinal strain (GLS) [ 26 – 28 ] and tissue Doppler myocardial velocity [ 29 ], however, can identify subclinical LV systolic dysfunction in the presence of a normal ejection fraction. In our cohort of T2DM subjects there was a non-significant trend to reduced resting LV GLS. However, LV GLS did not correlate with \(\dot{V}O_{2}\) peak amongst T2DM subjects (R = − 0.08, P = 0.78), and other echocardiography measures of LV function had similarly poor associations with exercise capacity. During exercise, contractile reserve, as quantified by LVEF and LVs’ augmentation, was similar and normal in both the T2DM group and controls. Reduced augmentation of cardiac index in T2DM It has been demonstrated previously that resting cardiac index is similar in healthy individuals regardless of fitness level [ 30 ], and thus the similar resting cardiac index across the groups in our cohort was expected. However, in T2DM subjects the augmentation of cardiac index during exercise was reduced, explained by significant differences in heart rate but not stroke volume. Lower heart rate reserve contributes to reduced cardiac index in T2DM Heart rate reserve was significantly reduced in those with T2DM compared to controls (mean 52 ± 13 bpm vs. 64 ± 11 bpm; P = 0.018) due to both a higher resting heart rate and a lower peak exercise heart rate. Possible explanations for the difference in heart rate reserve include diabetic cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN), reduced β-adrenoreceptor sensitivity or remodeling of the sinoatrial node. It is possible that the reduced HR reserve could also reflect a relative lack of physical exercise conditioning. Only one of our T2DM participants had a diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy, which is perhaps less than may be expected [ 31 , 32 ]. There is a large variability in the reported prevalence of diabetic CAN [ 33 ], although it appears to affect a similar proportion of people with type 1 and T2DM [ 34 ]. We note that our T1DM cohort displayed several risk factors for CAN including lengthy duration of DM, suboptimal glycemic control and additional microvascular disease. We therefore contend that should we have underestimated the number of subjects with CAN, both T1DM and T2DM groups should have been affected equally. This is not supported by our findings of reduced exercise capacity only in the T2DM group and not in those with T1DM. Wilson et al. [ 35 , 36 ] recently reported an almost identical reduction in HR reserve in T2DM subjects as compared with control subjects. They investigated whether this may be attributable to reduced β-adrenoreceptor sensitivity. However, the β-adrenoreceptor agonist dobutamine was associated with a greater relative increase in HR in T2DM subjects as compared with controls suggesting that factors other than β-adrenoreceptor dysfunction were responsible. It is possible that diabetes is associated with remodeling of ion-channels within the sino-atrial node that affect rate control, but this has not previously been investigated. On the other hand, exercise conditioning may explain the differences in heart rate reserve. Habitual exercise is associated with greater heart rate reserve, mainly because of lower resting heart rate [ 30 ] consistent with the observations in this study. Regular exercise programs, including high intensity interval training (HIIT), have been repeatedly shown to improve a range of cardiovascular measures and outcomes in people with DM, including lower resting heart rates and improved heart rate reserve [ 37 – 44 ]. Thus, it is reasonable to argue that the observation in our study that heart rate reserve was reduced in T2DM, but not in T1DM, may be explained by prior exercise conditioning rather than by diabetes itself. No differences in SVI, LVEDVI and LVESVI in DM subjects vs. controls The most definitive demonstration that cardiac function did not differ between DM subjects and matched controls was the demonstration that cardiac volumes changed similarly during exercise. There were no differences in SVI, LVEDVI or LVESVI during incremental exercise between T2DM or T1DM and their respective control groups. Resting LVEDVI was lower in T2DM subjects and remained so throughout incremental exercise (16% overall, P = 0.023). As illustrated in Fig. 3 , the LVEDVI change mirrored that of controls (interaction of exercise and group, P = 0.96) suggesting that there was no impairment in diastolic filling. This is consistent with a recent study by Wilson et al. [ 35 ] who also found no difference between changes in LVEDV during exercise in T2DM as compared with controls. Furthermore, the pattern of change in cardiac volumes during exercise in our study are the same as those described for normal physiology using exercise echocardiography [ 45 ] and exercise cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [ 9 , 46 ]. We contend that the anatomy of the LV itself (smaller LVEDV) may be the major factor contributing to attenuated cardiac reserve during exercise, rather than impaired diastolic filling of a small LV cavity. Increased LV volume predicts greater exercise capacity It has been well demonstrated that exercise capacity correlates strongly with cardiac size (LV volumes, LV mass or whole heart volumes), both in athletic and non-athletic populations [ 30 , 47 , 48 ]. We previously demonstrated that in the absence of overt contractile dysfunction, differences in cardiac function during exercise were modest and thus the major determinant of stroke volume during intense exercise was stroke volume at rest [ 30 ]. In the current study, we found no evidence of LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction and, like the experience in athletes, found strong correlations between resting cardiac geometry measures (LV mass, LVEDV and RVEDA) and \(\dot{V}O_{2}\) peak. LVEDV was most strongly associated with \(\dot{V}O_{2}\) peak in the entire cohort and remained a significant independent predictor on multivariate analysis after adjusting for age, sex and BSA. Most literature to date has focused on measures of cardiac function to explain exercise capacity in diabetes. We could not identify differences in function despite comprehensive resting and exercise measures. On the other hand, we identified differences in cardiac size (LVEDV) and we found a robust correlation between LVEDV and \(\dot{V}O_{2}\) peak. This is perhaps not surprising given that cardiac output is a major determinant of exercise capacity and, in the absence of differences in cardiac function, the major determinant of stroke volume is cardiac size. It is notable, however, that we did not find a strong relationship between LVEDV and \(\dot{V}O_{2}\) peak in all sub-groups. Whilst the association in the combined group of T1DM, T2DM and controls was strong, the correlation was diminished when comparing T2DM and controls or T1DM and controls (R = 0.51, P = 0.004 and R = 0.79, P < 0.0001, respectively). These comparisons are challenged by the limitations of sample size and also by the influence of covariates. Simple correlations do not consider the important confounders of age, gender and BSA, all of which influence \(\dot{V}O_{2}\) peak. Thus, the more robust analysis is the multivariate analysis in which LVEDV remained a significant independent predictor of \(\dot{V}O_{2}\) peak. Limited activity may explain exercise performance It is generally reported that levels of physical activity in people with T2DM are less than that of the general non-diabetic population [ 49 , 50 ] and this was also true in our comparison between T2DM subjects and controls according to estimated MET-hours. More importantly, weekly exercise participation was a significant independent predictor of \(\dot{V}O_{2}\) peak on multivariate analysis. The question arises as to how \(\dot{V}O_{2}\) peak could diminish in the setting of preserved cardiac function and how this could relate to reduced physical activity? Haykowsky et al. elegantly demonstrated that sedentary behavior was associated with reductions in \(\dot{V}O_{2}\) peak that was related to fatty infiltration and atrophy of peripheral muscle, thereby compromising peripheral O 2 diffusive metabolism [ 51 ]. Similarly, Russell et al. [ 52 ] attributed differences in exercise capacity between T2DM and controls to changes in the peripheral vasculature and muscle interface. We can only hypothesize by inference from our data as we did not assess the quality of peripheral muscle gas exchange. T2DM is most prevalent in older adults, and aging is associated with a linear decline in exercise capacity, accelerating after age 50 [ 53 ]. Physical inactivity compounds this age-related decline in \(\dot{V}O_{2}\) peak and increases the risk of cardiovascular mortality in people with T2DM [ 54 ]. The Dallas Bed Rest and Exercise Study [ 55 ] eloquently described a loss of cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiac mass and ventricular volumes that occurred following 3 weeks of bed rest. This extreme intervention resulted in cardiovascular changes equivalent to 30 years of aging. It has also been reported that one of the strongest predictors of heart failure in older adults is their level of fitness two decades earlier [ 56 ], and thus chronic inactivity could result in cardiac atrophy and reductions in functional capacity whilst also increasing insulin resistance and diabetes risk. As summarized in Fig. 5 , our observed association between less physical activity, smaller cardiac volumes and T2DM, lends weight to the premise that inactivity could be the common underlying factor causing both diabetes and exercise intolerance. Fig. 5 Collinearity between exercise capacity, heart size and T2DM. The lack of relationship between reduced exercise capacity and T1DM as well as the strong association with sedentary behavior and T2DM suggests that sedentary behavior may be the common link between T2DM and reduced exercise capacity Clinical implications It has been suggested that cardiac limitation in diabetes relates to increased fibrosis and stiffness of the myocardium [ 2 ]. Typical heart failure treatments have not proved efficacious and novel therapies have primarily targeted anti-fibrotic pathways. Such treatments may continue to prove fruitless if the cause of exercise limitation in diabetes is predominantly due to relative cardiac atrophy (or lack of physiological hypertrophy) associated with a sedentary lifestyle. Exercise is one of the few efficacious treatments in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [ 57 ] and this may be because it directly addresses the causative mechanisms. Our data identifies a strong association between sedentary behavior and reduced functional capacity implying that exercise may prove the best therapy for the prevention and treatment of exercise intolerance in patients with diabetes. Limitations The risk of recruitment bias is challenging to avoid in an exercise study given the tendency for healthier subjects to volunteer for a study that includes exercise assessment. However, DM subjects were recruited from specialist outpatient clinics where patients tend to have higher rates of co-morbidities than direct community recruitment. Patient demographics, glycemic control and medication use were similar to those described in previous DM cohorts suggesting that a healthy cohort bias does not explain the lack of cardiac dysfunction identified in the study. DM subjects were not excluded if known to have hypertension, which is a confounder to the diagnosis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Given that half of the T2DM group had a pre-existing diagnosis of hypertension, we contend that the normal measures of cardiac reserve strengthen our finding that myocardial dysfunction and therefore diabetic cardiomyopathy was not the cause of reduced exercise capacity. Although our DM group was equally split into T1DM and T2DM, we elected not to perform direct comparisons between these DM subtypes other than to perform univariate and multivariable analyses of the entire cohort. In our institution, it would not have been feasible to match T1DM and T2DM participants for age without significantly altering disease duration and the presence and severity of diabetic complications between the two groups, based on the demographics of our institution’s DM clinic patients. However, we believe the use of smaller healthy control groups to each DM subtype allows indirect comparisons to be drawn, in addition to collating all subject data for multivariable analyses. We relied on hospital records to determine the presence of diabetic neuropathy and did not perform cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests. This may have led to an underestimation of the number of DM subjects affected by mild diabetic neuropathy and CAN. However, our DM subjects had relatively mild severity of microvascular complications despite longstanding diabetes, and had no difference in resting heart rate or sinus tachycardia to suggest significant CAN. Invasive measurements of central hemodynamics were not performed and beyond the scope of the current study design. Nonetheless it has previously been demonstrated that Doppler echocardiography-derived estimates of CO and PASP allow for accurate measurements with moderate precision [ 58 ]. Finally, we did not quantify the degree of hyper-insulinemia and its effect on cardiovascular or peripheral vascular function. Insulin resistance is associated with reduced exercise capacity in heart failure populations with [ 59 , 60 ] and without [ 61 ] diabetes. However, as hyper-insulinemia is also present in obesity and metabolic syndrome, the ability to discern the relative contribution of obesity and diabetes is difficult and we do not think would alter the interpretation of our findings. Conclusions In our cohort of DM subjects, T2DM was associated with reduced exercise capacity whereas active subjects with T1DM had preserved exercise capacity relative to healthy controls. Reduced physical activity and smaller LV volumes, rather than subclinical cardiac dysfunction,   impaired exercise capacity. These findings suggest that physical inactivity may be a stronger predictor of exercise intolerance than hyperglycemia or myocardial dysfunction, and a powerful reminder to encourage exercise prescription to people with T2DM.
