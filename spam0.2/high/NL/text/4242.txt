Nkom seeks comments on plans to chance free use spectrum rules   12:40 CET | News 
Norwegian communications regulator Nkom is inviting comments by 14 May on its proposals to change rules concerning permission to use certain radio frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum that are not subject to individual allocation ('free use'). The proposals include a chapter on simplified licensing requirements that apply to point-to-point radio lines. It said the European harmonised regulations have made it necessary to review current regulations.
