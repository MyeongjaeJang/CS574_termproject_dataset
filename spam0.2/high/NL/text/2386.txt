Microsoft adds 315 megawatts of new solar power in Virginia   10:20 CET | News Microsoft purchased 315 MW of energy from Pleinmont I and II, two new solar projects in the commonwealth of Virginia. The company said this represents the single largest corporate purchase of solar energy ever in the US. The deal will allow Microsoft to make significant progress toward its goal of powering 60 percent of its data centres carbon neutral energy by early 2020. 
The Pleinmont projects are part of a larger 500-MW solar development, owned and operated by sPower, an AES and AIMCo company. The project is owned and will be operated by sPower , an independent renewable energy power producer based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Once operational, Pleinmont I and II will consist of more than 750,000 solar panels spread across more than 2,000 acres, and produce approximately 715,000 MWh a year. The deal is the company's second solar power purchase in Virginia. The size of the deal also puts Microsoftâ€™s total of directly purchased renewable energy at roughly 1.2 gigawatts.
