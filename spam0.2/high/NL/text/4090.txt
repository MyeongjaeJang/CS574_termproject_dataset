IFT confirms annulment of Televisa dominant player decision Monday 26 March 2018 | 09:23 CET | News 
Mexican broadcaster Grupo Televisa announced that the country’s telecommunications regulator IFT has annulled its 2017 decision that the company had substantial power in the pay-TV market, potentially resulting in tougher measures. The confirmation comes after the Mexican Supreme Court last month ruled that the broadcaster does not have “substantial power” in the pay-TV market and ordered the IFT to vacate its decision and cancel the procedure requiring Televisa to take steps to increase competition. Televisa is the country's largest satellite and cable television provider, and currently accounts for over 60 percent of Mexico’s 22 million-plus pay-TV subscribers. It increased its market share following the takeover of Cablevision Red, known as Telecable, in January 2015.
