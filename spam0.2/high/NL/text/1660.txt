Fewer than 20,000 Finns have gigabit broadband in 2017   11:59 CET | News 
Finnish telecoms regulator Ficora said that there were 1.71 million fixed broadband subscriptions in Finland at the end of 2017. The number has remained stable for a while now, but transmission speeds have gone up, it said. Even so, fewer than 20,000 subscribers have gigabit broadband. 
Connections with a download speed of 100 Mbps or more made up 32 percent of all broadband subscriptions, while only 6 percent boasted a similar upload speed. More than half of all connections had an upload speed of less than 10 Mbps. Around 100,000 subscribers upgraded their download speed to 30 Mbps or more in 2017. Fewer than 20,000 customers have a service at 1 Gbps. 
The speed rise is partly explained by the spread of fibre-based broadband, while copper connections continue to show a downward trend. In 780,000 of the broadband connections, fibre reached the boundary of the plot or building, while more than 100,000 were fully fibre-based connections (FTTH). 
The number of cable modem subscribers remained almost unchanged in 2017, accounting for a quarter of all broadband subscribers in Finland. Household fixed lines totalled only 150,000, down almost a quarter from the previous year.
