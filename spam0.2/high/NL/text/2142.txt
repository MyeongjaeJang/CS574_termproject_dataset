Kaspersky Laboratory to open data centre in Switzerland - report Wednesday 21 March 2018 | 17:32 CET | News 
Kaspersky Laboratory plans to open a data centre in Switzerland to address Western government concerns that Russia exploits its anti-virus software to spy on customers, according to internal documents seen by Reuters. 
Kaspersky is setting up the centre in response to actions in the US, the UK and Lithuania in 2017 to stop using the company’s products. The US in 2017 ordered civilian government agencies to remove the Kaspersky software from their networks. Kaspersky has strongly rejected the accusations and filed a lawsuit against the US ban . 
The US allegations were the trigger for setting up the Swiss data centre, said the person familiar with Kapersky’s Switzerland plans, but not the only factor. Work in Switzerland is due to begin within weeks and be completed by early 2020. 
The plans have been approved by Kaspersky Lab CEO and founder Eugene Kaspersky, who owns a majority of the privately held company, and will be announced publicly in the coming months, according to the source. The Swiss centre will collect and analyse files identified as suspicious on the PCs of tens of millions of Kaspersky customers in the US and the EU. Data from other customers will continue to be sent to a Moscow data centre for review and analysis.
