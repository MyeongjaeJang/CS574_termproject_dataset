Edgecore Networks introduces 400G open networking  15 CET | News 
Edgecore Networks announced it's contributing to the Open Compute Project (OCP) the design of a 400 Gigabit Ethernet (400G) data centre switch, the industryâ€™s first 400G open design, that will allow public and private network operators to increase the capacity of their infrastructures. Edgecore is contributing to OCP the specification and design package for the AS9716-32X open network switch, which provides 32 x QSFP-DD ports each capable of 400G operation, in a 1U form factor. 
The AS9716-32X switch is based on the Broadcom StrataXGS Tomahawk III Switch Series and incorporates an Intel Xeon Processor D control plane processor. As with all Edgecore open network switches, the 400G switch supports OCP software standards, including ONIE, Open Network Linux, the Open Optical Monitoring (OOM) API, and the Redfish hardware management API. Edgecore will work with commercial software partners and open software communities to enable commercial and open source Network Operating System (NOS) options for the 400G switch. 
At the OCP U.S. Summit in San Jose on 20-21 March, Edgecore will exhibit the AS9716-32X open network 400G switch. In addition, Edgecore will exhibit various open network products with partners at the OCP Summit and at Cloud Expo Europe in London on 21-22 March.
