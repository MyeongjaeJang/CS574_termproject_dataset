You know why Russia is so susceptible to propaganda, TV and so on? 
In Russia there is absolutely no local communities and no forms of leisure. Actually, it is. Not leisure weekend, though, and it is not, but everyday. Show completely… 
What I most marvel at overseas cafe in non-touristic areas. There really sit the locals, often 60+, drink coffee with cookies and communicate. Gather two or three, greet others, this is a local community and a form of leisure through a pleasant chat. See also: Khodorkovsky hopes to "buy" Russia 
And what we have… Retired from the clinic came in, turned on the TV, and away we go. The children came from work joined in. That’s the whole family leisure. Even the neighbors, and those who don’t know to come out ever smoke together to stand up. This is called atomization. 
TV is not looking someone once. And these people are propaganda not affected. For example, young people. There are community and leisure, and everything else.
