BaselWorld 2018 Rebellion Rebellion Predator S 3 Hands Titanium 
If you’re into the world of high tech cars and complex watches, it isn’t the question whether you can afford a Rebellion, the question is whether you can get a grip of it. Quirky Rebellion makes only a small collection of watches per year: 200. 
In collaboration with award-winning Eric Giroud, Rebellion Timepieces has conceived and developed the Predator in the same spirit as the rest of its collection: with authenticity, refined design and uncompromising quality and performance. This Predator S is a remarkable part of the collection, with a smaller-sized 42mm titanium case. Revamped to include three hands and date display, its contemporary honeycomb design leans towards a more delicate, even a feminine feel. On top off that his precision timepiece is superbly decorated.
