European data centre provider e-shelter, an NTT Communications Group company, has acquired a new development site in Frankfurt, which will be its fourth location in the city. E-shelter already operates three sites across the city, including campus Frankfurt 1. The ‘Frankfurt 4 Data Center’ campus is located in Hattersheim in the west of the city and will feature five DC buildings built out in phases, with the first building of 9.7MW IT load scheduled to open in early 2019. Once fully built out, the site will be capable of housing up to 60MW IT load and 24,000 sqm of IT space, supporting an average power density of 2.5 kW/sqm, E-shelter said. 
The new facility will offer both wholesale and retail colocation services, along with hybrid IT enterprise services and it will also fulfil NTT Communication's Nexcenter global data centre standards. The Frankfurt 4 Data Center will offer colocation space with high power density, carrier neutrality, cloud network access, connectivity and on-site support services, as well as on site dedicated service personnel 24/7. Customers will be able to choose from colocation deployments of single rack colocation and suites through to turnkey build to suit or shell and core services. 
E-shelter operates across ten locations in the DACH region with a data centre area of around 90,000 sqm. Outside of DACH E-shelter is also expanding to new markets with a new data centre campus opening in Amsterdam in early 2019 and development sites secured in both Madrid and London.
