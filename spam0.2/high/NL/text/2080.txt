Show promoter Mark Dunlop revealed shared the news today and told fight fans he is hoping to find a replacement to boost the card. 
“I am gutted to announce that Feargal McCrory has had to withdraw from “Collission” 14th April due to an injury sustained in training, we shall be working hard to find a replacement, great lad get well soon champ,” said Dunlop. 
McCrory, who looked set for a breakthrough after a number of impressive performances in 2017, confirmed the news and shared his disapointment. 
“Gutted to have to withdraw. I love this game and love to fight but unfortunately I won’t be out on April 14th. We wouldn’t be where we are today without the help of Mark. I’ll be at the show supporting all the lads in action and I have no doubt it will be a great show.” 
The show still has plenty for fans to get excited about with Paul Hyland Jr’s crucial British title eliminator versus Floyd Moore topping the bill.
