Nkom holds meeting on need for eIDAS accredition body  08 CET | News 
Norwegian electronic communications regulator Nkom has announced a meeting on 22 March in conjunction with the Department of Trade and Fisheries (NFD) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry organisation Norsk Akkreditering (NA) concerning the need to set up one or more eIDAS compliance assessment agencies in Norway. Nkom is inviting members of its 'Esignatur' forum to attend the meeting, as well as other companies interested in gaining accreditation. 
The European parliament and council regulation 910/2014 was passed in 2014 and concerns electronic identification (eID) and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS). This will replace the Norwegian electronic signature law once it is introduced to Norway. Providers of such services will have to present a certified assessment report before launching them. Currently, no Norwegian business has been accredited to carry out an assessment under the eIDAS regulation.
