The UK’s largest electric vehicle charging network, POLAR, now has 70 rapid chargers within the M25. 
Members of the network, which is run by Chargemaster, also have access to 18 rapid chargers within two miles of the M25, covering half of all junctions, and a maximum of one junction from all service areas on London’s orbital motorway. 
The POLAR network, which is run by Chargemaster, now has more rapid chargers across London than any other operator, as well as hundreds of destination chargers, including many on-street locations. 
Chargemaster has worked with strategic partners to expand the POLAR network across the UK, including car park operator Q-Park, the IHG and Accor hotel groups, and intu shopping centres. 
In London, Chargemaster has played a critical role in the Transport for London rapid charging network, which particularly supports drivers of the new electric taxi from LEVC. Chargemaster’s Ultracharge rapid chargers installed as part of the TfL rapid charging network are supplied with renewable electricity from OVO Energy. 
David Martell, Chief Executive of Chargemaster, said: “Over the next two years, Chargemaster will be investing some £50m in the expansion of the POLAR network to ensure that it remains the most reliable and comprehensive charging network for electric vehicle drivers in the UK. The recent increase in provision within the M25 shows the speed of expansion that we will be maintaining to keep pace with the fast-growing electric car market.”
