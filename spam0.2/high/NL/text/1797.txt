BT to hire 1,300 new apprentices, graduates in 2018   14:39 CET | News 
BT has confirmed plans to create more than 1,300 apprenticeship and graduate jobs in the UK in 2018. This is on top of Openreach's recent announcement that it was looking to take on 3,500 new network engineers. 
BT will take on apprentices and graduates in a number of different roles, including TV production, engineering, customer service and cyber security. Candidates will conduct a series of virtual reality (VR) tasks to be assessed on their analytical skills, how they handle change, and their drive and enthusiasm to complete tasks. Some of the new recruits will be based at the the BT Labs R&D facility at Adastral Park, Ipswich. Free Headlines in your E-mail
