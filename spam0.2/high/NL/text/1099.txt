KARACHI: Traffic at the South Asia Port Terminal Limited (SAPT) was suspended after two ships reportedly collided at the Karachi port here on Monday. 
According to information obtained from sources, a collision of Hapag-Lloyd's ship Tolten with Hamburg Bay resulted in the off boarding of at least 12 containers. 
The administration of the deep port, however, managed to avert possible damage to the cranes installed at the berth through a timely operation. 
Operations at the SAPT, which were suspended after the accident, will resume after the containers are removed from the sea through a special operation by the Karachi Port Trust.
