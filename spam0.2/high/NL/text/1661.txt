Telenet offers Wi-Fi amplifier to households   11:56 CET | News Belgian operator Telenet is offering households the chance to install a second Wi-Fi access point. That Wi-Fi amplifier will come in via a powerline (or ethernet if available) adapter in a different place of the house to ensure good coverage there too. 
Telenet has started the “Helemaal Mee Tournee,” with technicians coming to the home to set everything up, Datanews reported. Seven out of 10 consumers consider Wi-Fi to be as important as water, gas or electricity, according to a company survey. 
Telenet provides one Wi-Fi booster with its subscription, on loan. Additional boosters will cost EUR 2.00 per month. The company, part of the Liberty Global group, announced earlier that its new TV receiver will be tested this year.
