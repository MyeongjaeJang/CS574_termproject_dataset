Meetings and Exhibitions Hong Kong (MEHK) has announced the 2018/2019 Hong Kong Rewards! * programme with new added benefits for MICE organisers. 
Starting from 1st April 2018 through to 31st March 2019, MICE organisers will be able to bolster events held within the city through complimentary drinks receptions, meals, shopping vouchers, attraction entry and performances through the Hong Kong Rewards! programme. 
New for this year’s programme, MICE organisers will be able to redeem a complimentary meal, and welcome by an Ocean Park Character accompanied by a live band performance, when visiting Ocean Park* on Hong Kong Island. 
In addition, 11 new hotels have been added to the programme to offer MICE groups a complimentary drinks reception – some with added benefits such as complimentary rooms and spa treatments. 
Dawn Page, Director, UK and Northern Europe commented, “The Hong Kong Rewards! programme equips MICE planners with experiences that will enhance their events. Our 2018/2019 programme is bigger than ever, and we have worked closely with our tourism partners to ensure MICE organisers can get the most out of the city.”
