The Intergovernmental Authority Development (IGAD) Council of Ministers will meet on 26 March to evaluate the recent South Sudan’s peace talks and propose a way forward, a spokesman for South Sudan’s government said. 
“We haven’t gone back to Addis Ababa because have not yet received any invitation from IGAD. Last week, we received a letter saying the IGAD Council of Ministers will meet on 26 March to evaluate the latest peace talks and propose the way forward, and then decide on the next round of peace talks,”Michael Makuei, South Sudan’s Information Minister told Radio Tamazuj today. 
However, Makuei said his government was uncertain about the current political situation in Ethiopia after the resignation of its Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn. 
For his part, Federal Democratic Party leader Gabriel Changson Chang said the IGAD Council of Ministers will hold a meeting on 26 March to decide on the next round of South Sudan’s peace talks. 
“I think IGAD wants to evaluate the ceasefire and the recent peace talks before they could decide on the next round of talks,” he said. 
The South Sudanese opposition leader expected that the next peace talk will take place in mid April. 
IGAD officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Share this
