Philips ranks 19th in Reputation Institutes Global RepTrak 100 - Most Reputable Companies in the World WEBWIRE – Monday, March 19, 2018 
Philips has risen to the 19th position in the 2018 Global RepTrak 100 (RT100), which ranks the most reputable companies in the world. The list was also highlighted in this recent Forbes article . 
The global RT100 study investigates what drives trust and identifies supportive behaviors, such as peoples intent to purchase a companys products, and their willingness to invest in, or even work for, the company. 
While rankings dropped for 58 percent of companies in the RT100, Philips moved up two places. The study shows that aligned with the decline in reputation, garnering support among stakeholders has become more difficult for companies; expectations have risen, making it harder to earn trust, attain benefit of the doubt, create consumer loyalty and entice investors. 
The worlds largest corporate reputation study of its kind, the Global RepTrak 100 is based on more than 230,000 individual ratings collected in the first quarter of 2018. It includes comparative rankings, demographic trends, and unique insights into the dynamics behind reputational impact.
