US Justice Department seeks ban on bump stocks Published time: 23 Mar, 2018 21:52 Get short URL 
Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on Friday that he is proposing rule changes that will ban bump stock-type devices, which are gun attachments that enable semi-automatic weapons to fire more rapidly. The rules would be amended so that bump stock-type devices would be defined as a “ machine gun ” under federal law. Civilian ownership of machine guns has been heavily restricted under federal law since 1986. If the proposal is signed into law, current holders of bump-stocks would be required to surrender their devices, according to the Justice Department. " After the senseless attack in Las Vegas, this proposed rule is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress ," Sessions said in a statement.
