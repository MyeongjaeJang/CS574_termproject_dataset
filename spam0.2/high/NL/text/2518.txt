O2 UK is launching a new range of flexible Pay Monthly O2 Refresh tariffs across all handsets and tablets. They include roaming in 75 destinations at no extra cost, including the US, Australia and New Zealand. 
The new tariffs offer data volumes from 1G to 50GB, and allow customers to select any available handset or tablet to move their airtime bills up and down each month. For example, one month they can get 1GB data on a GBP 16 tariff, and then switch to 50GB with a GBP 36 a month plan. Flexible tariffs were first launched by O2 at end-2017. Following feedback from customers, it is now making flexible plans available to all new and upgrading customers on O2 Refresh. 
They allow customers to move a lower or higher tariff once each billing month depending on how much data they expect to use. On selected new tariffs, customers already benefiting from roaming at no extra cost in the O2 Europe Zone, can now benefit from roaming in 27 additional worldwide destinations.
