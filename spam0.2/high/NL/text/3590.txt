Why Every High School Should Teach A Social Media Class 
These headlines generate a lot of social media shares because people view sharing them as an opportunity to express themselves (thus, the “Self-Expression” name). 
People rarely share blog posts on social media simply because they’re good — they share them to express something about who they are and what they believe. 
A good Self-Expression headline plays directly into that desire. How To Mix And Match Headlines 
I’ve got one more advanced tip for you when it comes to writing headlines. 
Once you get the hang of these headline formats, look for ways to combine them to create more powerful headlines and check multiple boxes. 
A simple way to do this is to use one headline format for the headline of your blog post and a different one for the subheadline or description that gets pulled in to social media feeds when your post is shared. 
For example, that’s what I’ve tried to do on this post. 
You’ll notice the headline (“How To Write Headlines People Will Click, Like, And Share”) uses the Value Promise format while the subheadline (“The three headline templates that got me millions of readers”) employs the Personal Experience format. 
My hope is mixing these formats will appeal to multiple audiences and drive as many clicks and likes as possible. 
Will I be proven right? 
Well, those headlines got you here to read this, so I’m at least partially right — now it just depends on whether you like or share this post after reading it.
