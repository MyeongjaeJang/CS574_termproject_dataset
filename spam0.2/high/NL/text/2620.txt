The Stella Artois and Water.org partnership began in 2015 and leverages Stella Artois global footprint to help raise awareness of the water crisis and spark consumer action to address this critical issue. In 2017, Stella Artois and Water.org 
Each year Stella Artois introduces new Limited-Edition Chalices representing countries where Water.org provides support. This years Chalices feature designs by local artists in Mexico, India and the Philippines, and for every Chalice sold Stella Artois helps Water.org provide five years of clean water for one person in the developing world. 
This year, Stella Artois brought this global issue to the biggest stage in America  the Super Bowl  to encourage beer lovers to Make Your Super Bowl Party Matter, by stocking up on Stella Artois for the big game and beyond. From January 15 until April 15 of this year, every purchase of a Stella Artois 12-pack will help Water.org provide 12 months of clean water[ii] for one person in the developing world, while every purchase of a pour will help Water.org provide one month of clean water[iii] for one person. 
With Stella Artois reach and resources we continue to push creative boundaries together, to find new ways to shift perspective and drive action, said Julie LaGuardia, head of Brand Partnerships at Water.org . Our Super Bowl initiative, along with immersive experiences like Water Ripples and our Walk for Water social experiment, can help us create that connection in unexpected places. And its working. 
Our partnership with Stella Artois has made a major difference in raising awareness to help end the global water crisis, said Gary White, CEO and Co-founder of Water.org . Partnerships like these will help advance Water.org s goal to reach 60 million people by 2022. 
Supporting the AB InBev 2025 Sustainability Goals 
Alongside Stella Artois, AB InBev addresses the global water crisis through its 2025 Sustainability Goals  including its commitment that 100 percent of its communities in high stress areas have measurably improved water availability and quality. More than just a key ingredient in beer, water is a critical resource for the economic, social, and environmental well-being of AB InBev communities, and the company is dedicated to enhancing water access and security inside and outside its breweries. 
AB InBev recognizes the need to act as a responsible steward of water in the areas where it operates, but recognizes that the scale of the challenge is often bigger than the reach of its teams alone, and that long-term water security relies on partnership across sectors. AB InBev is on a journey with others to embed sustainability throughout its business and across its supply chain  addressing issues that are not only relevant to its business, but also have a positive impact on communities. This is evidenced by the success of the Stella Artois and Water.org partnership and its mutual efforts to inspire todays consumers to be the generation that ends the global water crisis.
