Spanish communications regulator CNMC has launched proceedings leading to a possible fine against state broadcaster RTVE for airing adverts that infringe the law prohibiting publicity other than for sporting or cultural events. In its statement, the CNMC said it’s probing ads broadcast by RTVE’s La 1, La 2, 24 Horas and Teledeporte channels from December 2017 and January 2018 and that the network has 15 to submit its allegations in response. The watchdog last year fined RTVE a total of EUR 222,600 for airing three advertising campaigns that breached current rules banning publicity on the state broadcaster. Free Headlines in your E-mail
