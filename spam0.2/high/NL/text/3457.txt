TWIC CENTRE - 23 Mar 2018 4 fishermen convicted for dyke destruction in Twic, Jonglei State 
A court in Twic Centre County of South Sudanâ€™s Jonglei State on Thursday fined four fishermen 3,000 SSP each for destroying a dyke in Wangole. 
Speaking to Radio Tamazuj on Thursday, Twic Centre County Commissioner Dau Akoi Jurkuch said a local court in Wangole found the four men guilty after some locals filed a complaint about the destruction of a dyke to the local authorities. 
Akoi pointed out that the dyke controls rain and Nile waters from flooding greater Twic, and any interference with it means jeopardizing lives of local residents and property. 
Greater Twic is a flood-prone area especially in the rainy season when the Nile River bursts its banks causing floods in the areas along the river.
