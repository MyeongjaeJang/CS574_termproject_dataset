Monex: Bank of England laat rente ongewijzigd   
Hieronder volgt een commentaar in het Engels van Bart Hordijk, valuta-analist bij Monex Europe op het rentebesluit van de Bank of England . 
The Bank of England kept the rates unchanged at 0.5%, but Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members Ian McCafferty and Michael Saunders voted in favour of hiking the rates already. They argued slack has disappeared from the economy and that wages are increasing. 
Sterling shot up on this and reached its highest point on cable in seven weeks. 
The MPC mentions that: “recent data releases are broadly consistent with the MPC’s view of the medium-term outlook as set out in the February Report”, which seems reasonable. Business investment remains lacklustre and also the balance of trade is not moving in a favourable direction for the UK, but Retail Sales saw two months of consecutive growth and wages – if you choose to include bonuses – are on the rise as well. 
There is still a risk inflation may soften faster than the MPC expects, for which the lower February Consumer Price Index reading we saw on Tuesday at 2.7% can be a sign, while also the Office of Budget Responsibilty considers inflation may undershoot the BoE target by the end of the year if the MPC continues on their planned hike path.
