Dutch govt plans new attempt at data retention requirement Monday 26 March 2018 | 16:08 CET | News 
The Dutch justice ministry announced plans to introduce new legislation on data retention by telecom operators. After the previous law was scrapped for infringing data protection principles, the new legislation would scale back the amount of data held by operators. The Council of State will be asked for advice on the draft legislation before its sent to parliament for consideration. 
The previous data retention requirement was abandoned, after rulings from the EU Court of Justice in 2015 and a court in The Hague in 2015. The telecom providers stopped collecting the data shortly thereafter. 
The previous government attempted to introduce a new form of data retention, in legislation presented in September 2016. However, this met with criticism from industry experts and parliament. Another ruling in December 2016 by the EU court also found that the mass collection of such data should not be allowed. Since then the EU member states have been working on a way to adapt the requirement in line with privacy law. Free Headlines in your E-mail
