Data centre network equipment revenue up 13% to USD 13.7 bln in 2017 Monday 26 March 2018 | 17:49 CET | News Data centre network equipment revenue, including data centre Ethernet switches, application delivery controllers (ADCs) and software-defined enterprise WAN (SD-WAN), rose 13 percent year-on-year to USD 13.7 billion in 2017, according to a research by IHS. In the short term, investment in physical infrastructure is still driving data centre network equipment revenue growth. However, in 2018 and 2019 the effect of server virtualisation will slow the market, with fewer but higher capacity servers reducing the need for data centre Ethernet switch ports, along with the move to virtual ADCs. 
Data centre network equipment revenue was on the rise, year over year, in all regions. It increased 10 percent in 2017 In North America and Europe, Middle-East and Africa (EMEA), by 23 percent in Asia Pacific (APAC) and 2 percent in Caribbean and Latin America (CALA). Other findings show that 25GE and 100GE data centre switching ports increased three-fold year over year. Also, new 200/400GE developments are underway, and shipments expected to begin in 2019. 
Long-term growth in the data centre network equipment market is expected to slow to 6 percent in 2022, as SD-WAN revenue growth slows due to the migration from the enterprise dater centre to the cloud. SD-WAN revenue is anticipated to reach USD 3.6 billion by 2022; the next wave for SD-WAN includes increased analytics, with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) providing multi-cloud connectivity. 
According to the same study, data centre Ethernet switch revenue rose 13 percent over the previous year, reaching USD 11.4 billion in 2017. 
SD-WAN market revenue hit USD 444.1 million for the full-year 2017. Bare metal switch revenue was up 60 percent year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017. ADC revenue was down 5 percent year over year in 2017.
