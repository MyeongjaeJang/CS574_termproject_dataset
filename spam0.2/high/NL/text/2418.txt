Turnout has gone up in all but one of the 10 cities singled out by DutchNews.nl for special attention during the local election campaign. Only in The Hague (separate story) is turnover down on 2014. For Amsterdam results, see separate story. 
Rotterdam Leefbaar Rotterdam , the right-wing populist party currently working with D66 and the Christian Democrats in the port city’s coalition, managed to retain its leading position in Wednesday’s vote. 
Despite losing two seats, Leefbaar’s total of 11 is more than double that of its nearest rivals. Party leader Joost Eerdmans said he aimed to create a broad coalition that did justice to the results and was looking into an alliance with the VVD , D66, PvdA and GroenLinks . 
Geert Wilders’ PVV , challenging Leefbaar on its home turf, only managed to win two seats. Islamic party NIDA retained its two while newcomer Denk took 3, showing the strength of the immigrant vote. Turnout was low at 46.8% but up on 2014’s 45.1%.
