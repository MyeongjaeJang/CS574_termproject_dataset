Wire Service Experience the Power of Nostalgia with Studio by Legacy Republic: The First Ever Portable Photo Album and Scrapbook Device That Brings Your Memories Back to Life Studio makes it easy to ensure every memory, from grandmas wartime wedding to dads 80s garage band, is re-lived for years to come SANTA CLARA, Calif. – WEBWIRE – Tuesday, March 20, 2018 
With societys growing desire for craving experiences over buying things and as more than 500 million photo albums wait to be digitized across 40M U.S. households, Legacy Republic is introducing Studio: the first portable device giving people access to a photo album revival in as little as an afternoon.

As the fastest growing experience-based company in the nostalgia economy, Legacy Republic creates a new life for old memories -- called Memory Makeovers -- via Studio. Without the stress of shipping sacred family photo albums out of the home, Studios portable technology allows for the in-home capture of albums to easily accessible, shareable, and high-quality digital images. 
Dozens of trusted and certified memory consultants, called Legacy Makers, are specially trained to operate Studio so that people can rediscover their family stories. With three patents to date and a fourth one on the way, Studio uses mobile edge computing  the iPhones camera, processor, and on-deck, proprietary software algorithms  to capture photo albums and process images to remove glare and artifacts. 
From there, the digitized album photos are added to a private cloud account called Family Legacy" where customers can share their memories, as well as work with their Legacy Maker to create premium photo gifts and home décor. 
Selling inexpensive consumer goods online doesnt require much customer care or interaction, but for us, working with something as intimate and invaluable as photos and albums, trust and relationships remain paramount, Brian Knapp, co-founder and CEO of Legacy Republic states.Thats why we offer Memory Makeovers via Studio for albums  to provide assurance, and develop lasting relationships with customers, all built around re-living and celebrating irreplaceable photos. Were thrilled with the progress of our team thus far, and cant wait to see what memories are uncovered next. 
Beth Beller, a Legacy Maker based in North Fort Myers, Florida, has helped more than 141 households digitize and preserve their memories since the storms hit south Florida last year. In several of these instances, Beller used Studio to digitize photo albums in the customers home, particularly important for those concerned about letting those memories leave their sight. Studio is fully portable, so that Legacy Makers can capture and upload your photo albums over a single afternoon at your home. Others in the region clearly understand the need for such a service  Beller has recruited another 155 Legacy Makers alone. 
 Many of my clients feel wary about sending their irreplaceable family possessions out of their home, even under the safest circumstances, said Beth Beller, a longtime Legacy Maker. Studio allows me to not only build trust with my clients as I preserve their memories in their own homes, but to watch families in my community experience their dearest memories in the process. 
Starting at $40 per album, the cost covers the first 20 page sides and then $1.50 per page side after 20. There is no additional charge for the front and back covers and the two inside covers. To experience Studio today, visit: legacyrepublic.com/studio
