Audiences find and follow us in different places, then hop over to Facebook and like our page! 
Try it, it works! 
In order to boost our numbers, we run two paid traffic campaigns: The most recent Blog Post Page Likes 
Both of these campaigns run on a budget of £5 per day.

When our post is on Facebook and our ad is running, we let it do the work, but when we receive a comment, we always write a response… 
…yes, it sticks to our pre-eminence strategy, but it also improves the ORGANIC REACH of our post… 
…meaning more people see it without us having to pay! 
This is because Facebooks algorithm uses ENGAGEMENT as a key metric. If a post has a high number of shares, likes and comments, Facebook shows it to more people! 
If you ever receive comments, make sure you reply too. It might just grab you a few more followers. 10k Facebook Likes: Just the Beginning
