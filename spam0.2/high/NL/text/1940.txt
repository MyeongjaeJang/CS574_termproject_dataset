Dutch govt proposes end to cost compensation for NL-Alert  31 CET | News 
The Dutch government has proposed making the NL-alert system for emergency SMS mandatory for all mobile operators and requiring them to bear any costs associated with delivering the messages. The proposal is open for consultation. 
NL-Alert has been implemented since 2014, based on contracts with the mobile operators. To date, the justice ministry has borne the costs of the system. With the technical system now proven, it wants to move to a new agreement with the four mobile operators. 
Under the proposal, any eventual investments by the operators in replacement or new systems for NL-Alert would not be compensated by the state. Furthermore, the ministerial decision would make it mandatory for the operators to have the correct equipment to deliver the messages and bear any associated costs.
