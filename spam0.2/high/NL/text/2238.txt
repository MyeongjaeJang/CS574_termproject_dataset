Former Beats executive Iovine planning to leave Apple Music - report Wednesday 21 March 2018 | 16:20 CET | News Jimmy Iovine, who joined Apple when the company bought Beats Electronics in 2014 for USD 3 billion, will step back from the company’s streaming music business from August, and transition into a consulting role, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources familiar with the plans. The timing of Iovine’s departure is linked to the Apple shares he received when Beats was taken over; these will fully vest in August, the sources added. Iovine told people close to him that he plans to spend more time with his family, while supporting Apple SVP Eddy Cue, who oversees Apple Music. 
Iovine led the Los Angeles music office. Robert Kondrk oversees the business of Apple Music and iTunes, and Jeff Robbin the product and engineering teams. Cue now will have to determine whether to continue dividing responsibilities between Kondrk and Robbin, elevate one to a more public role, or look externally for someone to replace Iovine, the sources said. Iovine was the last executive to stay on at Apple Music after the acquisition of Beats; Beats CEO Ian Rogers, co-founder Dr Dre and executive Trent Reznor have all left the company, or distanced themselves from it. Beats president Luke Wood, who oversees the headphone business, is another exception. He will be remaining at Apple.
