Globacom denies targeting married women in staff reduction   09:05 CET | News 
Nigerian operator Globacom has terminated the contracts of 90 of its female staff in various Glo Friendship Centres across the country for being married, a Premium Times report claimed. A Globacom official said the sackings were a routine exercise that affected all staff, irrespective of gender or marital status. The staff, mostly women, were on 09 March served letters terminating their services. 
The issue has generated heated debate among Nigerians who accused the company of discrimination, not only against women, but also against their marital status. An official of the company, who sought anonymity, said reports that only female staff members were being sacked because of their marital status, were not correct as it involved all categories of employee. 
The official described the sackings as a normal annual evaluation and rationalisation exercise. The official said a lot of people who met the minimum performance criteria set by the company, were promoted, including married women. The official said the real reason the affected staff were asked to go was their failure to successfully scale through an annual performance appraisal exercise. Free Headlines in your E-mail
