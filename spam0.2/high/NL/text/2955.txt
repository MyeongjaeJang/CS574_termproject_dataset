Aaron McKenna scores first-round KO in U.S. TV debut By Joe O'Neill | on March 23,   
Aaron McKenna made a major splash on his U.S. TV debut tonight. 
In just his second fight, The young Monaghan welterweight featured live coast-to-coast on ESPN Deportes on a Golden Boy card at the Fantasy Springs Resort and Casino in Indio, California. 
Having seen a fight fall through just hours beforehand earlier in the month, McKenna must have been just relieved to actually make it to the ring tonight – and the 18-year-old didn’t hang around when he got there. 
Facing Colorado puncher Jose Palacios, the physically imposing McKenna destroyed his overmatched opponent, forcing a stoppage in the first of four scheduled rounds. Widgets Magazine 
A huge backhand right had Palacios down early, following a few follow-up shots and McKenna subsequently went in for the kill, attacking the body. The shell-shocked away fighter sought to fight back but was doubled over with a body shot and caught with a cuffing shot to the side of the head. 
A grimacing Palacios tried to claim a rabbit punch but the referee was unconvinced and, when the journeyman refused to answer whether he wanted to continue, the bout was waved off. 
The quickfire win sees McKenna – both Ireland and Golden Boy’s youngest current pro – improve to 2(1)-0, while Palacios falls to 0-2(1). 
A short night at the office for the two-time European underage medalist, a new date in the near futue for the L.A.-based McKenna is expected soon. Share this:
