Hamas reopens Wataniya Mobile in Gaza after bomb row Wednesday 21 March 2018 | 14:33 CET | News 
Hamas has announced it will reopen the Gaza Strip offices of mobile operator Wataniya Mobile, accused of failing to comply with probe into attack targeting Rami Hamdallah, Times of Israel reported. The Hamas-run police in Gaza closed down Wataniya Mobile in the Palestinian enclave on 17 March, after the state prosecutor accused it of failing to comply with the investigation into the bomb attack targeting Rami Hamdallah. 
Hamdallah, who is prime minister of the Palestinian government in the West Bank, was unharmed when a roadside bomb on 13 March blew up near his convoy during a rare visit to the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. Six of his bodyguards were lightly wounded. The attorney general in Gaza, in a statement, said that the company would reopen fully, without giving further details. 
There has been no claim of responsibility for the bomb attack, though Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on 19 March directly accused Hamas.The Islamist movement rejected the charge and said it was investigating, suggesting Israel might be to blame.
