Unearthing Secrets beneath the Surface Retired air force officer relives his thrilling life in a work of fiction Queensbury, New York – WEBWIRE – Wednesday, March 21, 2018 The Green Vial by Nicholas Orsini 
Not all underground movements felt are caused by nature. Retired airman and former chief of the Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory Nicholas Orsini proves this true in his thriller, The Green Vial . Orsinis twenty-four years service in the US Air Force; his work in the Vela Uniform program, which involved monitoring underground nuclear explosions; and his leadership at the Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory, where he oversaw seismic station installations in Africa and South America, earned him many close callsall reflected in The Green Vial . His book provides an insider look at the unnerving happenings between warring countries and within Americas government agencies. The story focuses on Dr. Roger Rogers and assistant Teresa Marchetti as they discover a sinister plot directed toward the United States. From there, they are led by distressing clues to unwanted places and unlikely friends and enemies, all beyond their jobs jurisdiction. With millions of lives at stake, Dr. Rogers takes on the challenge that could cost him his life. Orsini delights in keeping his readers entertained and intrigued. The Green Vial is available in selected online bookstores.
