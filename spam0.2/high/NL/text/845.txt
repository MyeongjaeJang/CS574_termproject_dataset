IKEA is opening a world of furnishing possibilities to millions of Android users around the world, allowing more people to see how a great piece of furniture might amp up their space. IKEA Place lets users confidently experiment, experience and place 3-D representations of more than 3,200 IKEA products into their space to ensure that they are just the right size and design from sofas and lighting to beds and wardrobes. IKEA Place is now available on Android for all ARCore compatible devices. 
When we first launched IKEA Place on iOS 11, in September 2017, we gave our customers the opportunity to try before you buy. Customers truly appreciate that we are helping them to create a better life at home using our AR technology. Todays release is about bringing the ease of IKEA Place to over 100 million Android devices as well, says Michael Valdsgaard, Leader Digital Transformation at Inter IKEA Systems. 
Visual search The latest release has a range of new features, including Visual Search powered by Grokstyle. This allows people to take a picture with their phone of any furniture they see, and then find similar or matching IKEA products through the app, ready for purchase. 
Barriers between the digital and physical world are disappearing fast. To keep pace with that change, we focus on opening up new ways for people to access IKEA, wherever they are, Michael continues.
