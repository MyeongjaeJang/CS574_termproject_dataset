This is us doing that. 
Many within the crypto community have been a bit surprised to hear Johnny and Ched’s included in the Philakone trading group that is shilling it’s services for $50k per new team member. Ched and Johnny, generally, have better reputations than Phil and Choe. 
We received any number of “say it ain’t so” messages with respect to Ched’s involvement. 
As of now, we’ve yet to receive any clarifying statements from the group. Rather, blocked accounts and threats. 
We’d like to give these two guys the benefit of the doubt…so we extend another invitation…Johnny and Ched’s – talk to us and explain where things stand. 
Crypto is a forgiving community. Nobody is going to begrudge you making a dollar. But silence and affiliations tell a story. We remain open to speaking to both of you. 
And the threats…on both sides, need to stop.
