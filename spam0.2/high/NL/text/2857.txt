Next fight confirmed for Mick Conlan By Joe O'Neill | on March 22,   
Less than one week on from win number six, Mick Conlan [6(5)-0] has had fight date number seven confirmed. 
The Belfast featherweight stopped David Berna inside two rounds at The Theater at Madison Square Garden on St Patrick’s Day and will return to the same New York venue on Saturday May 12th . 
The Top Rank prospect has been confirmed for the undercard of Jorge Linares’s WBA lightweight title defence versus Ukrainian phenomenon Vasyl Lomachenko in the main room of the historic Manhattan venue. 
Lomachenko will be aiming to become a three weight champion in just his twelfth. For Venezuelan Linares, himself a three-weight champ, it will be his fourth defence. Widgets Magazine 
It’s a later date than intended for 26-year-old Conlan who was initially due to box on the Jeff Horn v Terence Crawford undercard at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas on April 14th. This fight, however, has been postponed due to an injury to Crawford. 
Conlan’s eighth fight is due to take place back in his home city of Belfast, with the Falls Road featherweight previously suggesting either the last weekend of May or the first weekend in June. Considering he is now fighting May 12th it is assumed this bout will be taking place in June at the very earliest. 
Olympic bronze medalist Conlan stepped up to eight rounds for the first time versus Berna. It is still to be confirmed what distance he will be fighting over in seven weeks time. 
Also due to box on the undercard of the ESPN-broadcast fight are Carlos Adames, Teofimo Lopez, Fazliddin Gaibnazarov, and Conlan’s American rival Shakur Stevenson. 
An opponent for Conlan will be confirmed shortly. Share this:
