I Knew the Cold War. This Is No Cold War.

Su suggerimento di @Giovanni . 
In un articolo per Foreign Policy , il politologo statunitense Stephen Walt spiega perché, a suo parere, parlare di un ritorno al clima della Guerra Fredda nelle relazioni tra USA e Russia è fuorviante: 
The current situation is bad. But to call it a “new Cold War” is misleading more than it is enlightening. If one compares the two situations more carefully, what is happening today is a mere shadow of that earlier rivalry. Viewing today’s troubles as a new Cold War downplays the role that human agency and bad policy decisions have played in bringing the United States and Russia to the current impasse, distracts us from more important challenges, and discourages us from thinking creatively about how to move beyond the present level of rancor.
