On Wednesday Queen Latifah announced the passing of her mother Rita Ownes, who battled a heart condition for more than a decade. 
Latifah released a statement to People and said: 
It is with a heavy heart that I share the news, my mother, Rita Owens passed away today. Anyone that has ever met her knows what a bright light she was on this earth. She was gentle, but strong, sweet, but sassy, worldly but pragmatic, a woman of great faith and certainly the love of my life.” 
She had struggled with a heart condition for many years and her battle is now over. I am heartbroken but know she is at peace. Thank you for your kindness, support and respect for our privacy at this time. Much Love, Dana Owens (aka Queen Latif‎ah), forever Rita Owens’ daughter.” 
Throughout her career, Queen Latifah has shared the screen with her mother during some of her most infamous projects. Including the show “Living Single,” and also the 2004 “The Cookout.” 

We send our love and prayers to Queen Latifah during this difficult time.
