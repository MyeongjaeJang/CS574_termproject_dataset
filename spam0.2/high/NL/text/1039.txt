Kingston expands its HyperX Fury and Impact DDR4 memory lineup by Email 
Reaching frequencies of up to 3,466MHz 
Kingston has announced that it has expanded both the Fury desktop and Impact mobile DDR4 memory lineup with frequencies now reaching up to 3,466MHz for the desktop and 3,200MHz for the mobile lineup. 
In addition to higher frequencies, both HyperX lineups will also be getting higher capacity modules and kits, reaching 16GB and 64GB. The voltage remained on a standard 1.2V on all modules and kits, and Kingston was keen to note that upgrading using the Plug N Play feature allows automatic overclocking to the highest published frequency within the system speed allowance. 
According to details provided by Kingston , the HyperX Fury DDR4 desktop lineup will now be available in 4GB, 8GB and 16GB modules, 8GB, 16GB and 32GB kits of 2, and 16GB, 32GB and 64GB kits of 4. It will be available in frequencies ranging from 2,400MHz to 3,466MHz with latencies from CL15 to CL19. 
Kingston also revealed a total of 12 different SKUs that will be available with the new 3,466MHz frequency and come in different module and kit configurations. 
As far as HyperX Impact DDR4 mobile lineup goes, these will also be available in the same capacity configurations and with frequency ranging from 2,400MHz to 3,200MHz with latency from CL14 to CL20. 
The new HyperX Fury and HyperX Impact DDR4 memory modules and kits should be available in retail/e-tail soon.
