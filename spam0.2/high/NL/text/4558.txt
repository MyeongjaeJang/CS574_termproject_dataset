Rockwell Collins has received a follow-on order for 300 Military Code (M-Code) GPS receivers from the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center (USAF SMC). The order comes after the recent fulfillment of 770 receivers in support of the Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) program. 
“This order will help accelerate the rapid integration and fielding of M-Code,” said Rob Scott, director, Navigation Solutions for Rockwell Collins. “The delivery of our high-performing M-Code GPS receivers will enable the next generation of reliable and secure military navigation.” 
The next major development milestone for Rockwell Collins’ M-Code receivers is the expected 2018 completion of the Global Positioning Systems Directorate (GPS-D) security certification. Completion of certification will expedite broader testing of the M-Code receivers in more platforms and locations. Related Research on ASDReports.com:
