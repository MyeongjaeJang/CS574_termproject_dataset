Government backtracks on plan to change peace talks venue File photo: Information Minister Michael Michael 
South Sudan’s government appeared to backtrack last Wednesday on an earlier statement that it had raised the issue of changing the venue for peace negotiations in Addis due to Ethiopia’s political instability. 
The issue came up earlier this week after South Sudan’s Minister of Information said his government was seeking a change of venue for peace talks, citing Ethiopia's recent political instability. 
In the new statement issued on Wednesday, South Sudan government has assured its continued desire for Ethiopia to host South Sudan peace talks. 
The government said it stands with the people and the government of Ethiopia, pointing out that it is ready for the next round of peace talks in Addis Ababa. 
“TGoNU is anxious and longing for peace to its citizens,” the statement reads in part. 
The government thanked the Norway, United States, UK, China and in general IGAD member states for their continued support for the peace process and affirmed South Sudan's government commitment to the ongoing peace talks. Share this
