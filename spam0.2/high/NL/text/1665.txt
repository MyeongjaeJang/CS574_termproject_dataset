GATEway project delivers public shuttle service with driverless pods Wednesday 21 March 2018 | 11:44 CET | News 
The GATEway autonomous vehicle project in the UK is now entering its final phase. This will see a fleet of driverless pods provide a shuttle service around the Greenwich Peninsula in London to study public acceptance of and attitudes to driverless vehicles. 
In a world first, members of the public are invited to participate in the research trial by riding in or engaging with the pods, and then sharing their opinions and experience. This phase will see four driverless pods travel around a 3.4 km route, using advanced sensors and autonomy software to detect and avoid obstacles as they collect and drop off passengers at four designated stops. The GATEway project is jointly funded by government and industry. 
The final phase of the project comes as the UK Government launches a review of driving laws in preparation for self-driving vehicles. A 3-year review will be conducted by the Law Commission of England and Wales, and the Scottish Law Commission, to examine any legal obstacles to the widespread introduction of self-driving vehicles. The review will identify any need for regulatory reform.
