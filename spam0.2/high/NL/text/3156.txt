Extended Range of Wideband Electronic Warfare Antennas Extended Range of Wideband ... Extended Range of Wideband Electronic Warfare Antennas 
Cobham Antenna Systems, a market-leading antenna manufacturer, has been a significant producer of antennas for the Electronic Warfare (EW) market for over 20 years and continues to help customers meet the ever-changing need to extend coverage with wider frequency bands, higher power and niche applications. 
Cobham is pleased to announce an expansion to its range of wideband omnidirectional antennas for EW applications. Many new options are available with examples including: 
OA-0.4-6.0V/2090: A wideband discone antenna covering 0.38 – 6.00 GHz capable of handling 100W CW. This antenna is very rugged, low profile with a built in ground plane making it suitable for multiple applications, especially for ground to air coverage.

OA2-1.76-6.0V/2406: A wideband rugged antenna covering 1.76 – 6.00 GHz and capable of handling 50W CW. This centre-fed antenna covers L, S and C bands within a single unit. The antenna does not require a ground-plane and peak gain is on the horizon across the frequency range. 
OA-0.03-0.50V/2425: A wideband rugged vehicle spring-mounted whip antenna covering 30 – 512 MHz and capable of power handling of up to 200W CW. This rugged, ground-plane dependant, antenna covers VHF and UHF frequencies within a single unit. 
The full range of wideband omni antennas includes but is not limited to: manpack; body-worn; vehicle mount; high power; UAV and ground robot antennas. Cobham Antenna Systems also has complementary range of directional antennas covering 300MHz to 27GHz, which are used for a number of EW and surveillance applications. Source: Cobham
