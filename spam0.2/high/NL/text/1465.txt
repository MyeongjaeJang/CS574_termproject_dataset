Parents at a Brooklyn Public School are pissed at the school after a student lit the school up with pepper spray, causing several people to be rushed to the hospital. 
According to NY Daily News, eleven children and one staffer at the school had a reaction to the irritant. 
No one was seriously hurt but it’s clear by the parents comments that they’ve had enough of this school. 
“A little kid was inside the dance room and he sprayed a can of Mace in the air and it got all the kids,” said one rattled parent “I am tired of the s–t at the school.” 
The 8-year-old student who sprayed his class claimed he found the can and brought it to school and just wanted to see what would happen.20 people reported minor complaints and a dozen were taken to Brookdale Hospital
