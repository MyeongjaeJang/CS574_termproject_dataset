AB InBev launches 2025 Sustainability Goals and 100+ Accelerator to advance local innovations for pressing global challenges Worlds leading brewer builds on sustainability achievements with most ambitious commitments yet WEBWIRE – Thursday, March 22, 2018 
Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) commits to 2025 Sustainability Goals in smart agriculture, water stewardship, circular packaging, and climate action. The delivery of the goals will have wide-reaching impact that includes connecting thousands of farmers to technologies and skills, ensuring water access and quality in high-stress communities, partnering with our suppliers to increase recycling content, and adding renewable electricity capacity to regional grids. 
Having achieved all previous sustainability goals over the past decade, we will continue to advance our environmental and social commitments while introducing new programs that have positive impact on the communities where we operate. 
As a truly global brewer, we are uniquely positioned to identify the local solutions needed to solve environmental and social challenges. This will come to life through our newly created 100+ Sustainability Accelerator, enabling us to enlist scientists, technologists, and budding entrepreneurs around the world to help build and scale solutions. 
The 100+ Sustainability Accelerator will aim to solve 100+ challenges by 2025. The accelerator will support promising ideas and high potential technologies, reflecting our vision of building a company to last for the next 100 years and beyond. Powered by ZX Ventures, the 100+ Sustainability Accelerator will run annual boot camps in 9 markets followed by a 10-week program for select entrepreneurs to test and scale solutions. The first set of challenges will be announced in June. 
Our Dream is to bring people together for a better world, which is why we are committed to supporting a healthy environment and strong communities. Climate change is the most pressing issue confronting our planet and could impact the natural resources we rely on to brew our high quality beers. More than ever, we see an opportunity to use sustainability as a catalyst for innovation, said Carlos Brito, Chief Executive Officer of AB InBev. Our 2025 Sustainability Goals and 100+ Accelerator will complement each other, providing solutions for environmental and social challenges so we can build a company to last for the next 100+ years.
