Coimbatore : BJP Tamil Nadu unit President Tamilisai Soundararajan on Wednesday took on those opposing the Ram Rajya Rath Yatra of VHP, asking whether they do not want the votes of Hindus. 
“If the Rath carrying Ram and Sita cannot come to Tamil Nadu, no single Hindu vote should go to these organisations and parties. They want votes and not Raths,” she said. 
Tamilisai, who visited district unit President Nandakumar on whose house a petrol bomb was hurled two days back, told reporters that such an incident was condemnable and should not leave it alone. “Tamil Nadu will not bear, If we start arising,” she cautioned. 
“We will see in the coming days whether the birth of Periyar was great or that of Nayanmars and Alwars,” Tamilisai pointed out. 
“In future they should be afraid of talking about Hindu religion,” she said. 
Meanwhile, former BJP MP and Coir Board Chairman C.P. Radhakrishnan told reporters, after visiting the spot, that terrorists were emboldened with the support and protection being extended by certain political parties. 
“Such protection and support from certain political parties resulted in the serial bomb blasts in the city (during the visit of BJP leader L.K. Advani in 1998 which claimed 52 lives),” Radhakrishnan said. 
Seeking the arrest of leaders of such political parties, Radhakrishnan urged the police not to pave way for the repeat of 1998. ALSO READ
