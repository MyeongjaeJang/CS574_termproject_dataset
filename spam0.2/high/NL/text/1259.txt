Written by Andrew McDonald 4 hours ago RDK Management claims that video and broadband service providers have now deployed more than 40 million devices running the RDK software worldwide. Announcing the update at the Connected TV World Summit in London this morning, RDK Management said the deployment figure is up 62% compared to the same time last year. In total, more than 25 video and service providers across North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia are members of the RDK community and are in various stages of evaluating, testing, or deploying the software, said the organisation. There are also now 350 technology companies in the RDK community, up 17% year-on-year. These include electronics manufacturers, SoC vendors, software developers, and system integrators. “With more than 40 million RDK-based set-top boxes and broadband gateways deployed globally, it’s clear that service providers, and their suppliers, have found a prime open source software development platform upon which to drive future growth and innovation,” said Steve Heeb, president and general manager of RDK Management. “Our transparent approach to solving common technical challenges enables operators to focus their efforts on creating the UIs, applications and back-end data analytics that enhance the customer experience and business results. Our community will also be there with solutions, beyond TV and internet, as the industry expands into IoT and new kinds of smart home services.” RDK Management is a joint venture between Comcast Cable, Time Warner Cable and Liberty Global, created to administer the Reference Design Kit (RDK) software. This is used in customer premises equipment provided by operators and is found in the chipsets of these devices. Companies that have publicly announced deployment plans for RDK-based services include Comcast, Cox, J:COM, Liberty Global, Melita, NOS, NOWO, Rogers, Shaw, Tele Columbus, Vidéotron, and Vodafone.
