Jon, Jason and Mike were given access to another Tales from The Vicarage Live and caught up with Richard Lee, Richard Johnson, Sean Dyche (5th Appearance for the exhaust eater), Paul Robinson and the man of the night Alec Chamberlain. 
The guys share their memories of Alec, their time at Watford and we find out what they are currently up to – apart from Sean as we all know how well he’s doing! 
Host of the Evening, Adam Leventhal tells the boys about the work Tales from The Vicarage are doing with Kit Aid in Malawi and what we can expect from the next edition of the TFTV books this autumn.
