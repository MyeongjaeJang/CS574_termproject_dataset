Lufthansa to fly non-stop to Jeddah and Addis Ababa in two separate flights from October 2018 WEBWIRE – Wednesday, March 21, 2018 Addis Ababa New, attractive take-off times to Jeddah and Addis Ababa Improved access to the global network of Lufthansa Group Bookable as of today 
In the 2018/19 winter flight schedule, Lufthansa will be offering the connections from Frankfurt to Jeddah (Saudi Arabia) and Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) as two separate flights. Until now, the only connection from Frankfurt to Addis Ababa involved a time-consuming stop-over in Jeddah. Wide-body aircraft and improved departure times make these connections even more attractive for travelers, while the early-morning arrival in Frankfurt gives passengers access to the entire range of Lufthansa flights to destinations around the world. With this change, Lufthansa is reacting to increased demand for tickets to these two destinations. 
The new non-stop connection from Frankfurt to Addis Ababa will be served daily, except on Tuesdays and on Sundays. An Airbus A340-300 with the flight number LH598 will take off for the East African metropolis at 2:10 p.m. and reach the Ethiopian capital at 10:55 p.m. local time. The return flight leaves Addis Ababa at 00:55 a.m. the next day and arrives in Frankfurt at 6:35 a.m. The non-stop flight will decrease the average flight duration to approximately seven hours. 
Every day except Wednesday, an Airbus A330-300 with the flight number LH652 will fly from Frankfurt to Jeddah, leaving the Rhine-Main area at 2:10 p.m. and arriving in Jeddah around 9:40 p.m. The return flight is scheduled to leave Jeddah at 1:50 a.m. the following day and arrive in Frankfurt at 5:45 a.m. 
Tickets for the flights can be booked as of today, March 21, 2018. Additional information and the option to book Lufthansa flights are available online at LH.com or through the Lufthansa service center, which can be reached at +49 (0) 69 86 799 799 (calls charged at standard landline rates). Flights can also be booked through Lufthansas partner travel agencies and at the Lufthansa sales counters at airports.
