LatAm countries commit to roaming-free continent by 2022 Wednesday 21 March 2018 | 11:55 CET | News 
Delegates from 19 countries in North, South and Central America and the Caribbean have jointly committed to removing roaming fees throughout the American continent during the annual meeting of the Inter-American Telecommunication Commission (CITEL) in Buenos Aires. Under the terms of the framework agreement, the signatories pledged to put an end to roaming fees by 2022. “We have the duty to generate the conditions for our citizens to communicate without any barriers, and to encourage the investments so that our operators can offer an accessible and high-quality service,” said Argentina's modernisation minister Andres Ibarra after the agreement was signed. 
The proposal was signed by Argentina, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay and the US, but not Chile or Bolivia. Chile and Argentina last year announced the elimination of international roaming charges between the two countries by 2020, while America Movil said it planned to scrap roaming fees for subscribers to its Claro brand throughout the Pacific Alliance trading bloc of Peru, Chile, Colombia and Mexico.
