Wire Service New Sleep Series Set to Awaken the Nation We all crave restful sleep, but not everyone achieves this, and one Australian man and his team of health experts have released a series of articles designed to help remedy the chronic disorders impacting Aussie health. Horsham, Victoria, Australia – WEBWIRE – Friday, March 23, 2018 
The articles are designed to inform, educate and inspire people suffering from sleep problems into good health. We want more zzzzs and less grumbles! What better way than to share that information free of charge? 
His name? Des Lardner. 
According to a sleep study done by the Sleep Health Foundation in 2016, 45% of adults are affected by a sleep disorder, with diagnosed sleep apnoea affecting 8%, significant insomnia 20% and restless legs 18% of adults. Recent research suggests sleep has immense repair value to us all. While we sleep our body repairs, rebuilds and prepares the body for incoming stresses and activity. 
The Sleep Health Foundation suggests 33-45% of adults sleep is affected negatively. Conversely, poor sleep has a role in increasing blood pressure, increasing blood sugar, increasing body weight by changing certain hormones, increasing cardiac risk factors, and reducing daytime energy. Insomnia is driving Aussies mad, and help has arrived with the new sleep series. 
The results from the Sleep Foundation are scary and symptoms often go unchecked with people seeking assistance after many years when they are already feeling the impact. Some of which can be deadly. 
Des Lardner is about to change it. The dedicated Pharmacist and Natural Health Practitioner heads up Des Lardner Organic tucked away in the beautiful landscape that is the Wimmera. However, his education and practices reach far and wide. Des is an award-winning mentor to many young Naturopaths and health practitioners with a focus on organics, scientifically validated remedies and sleep disorders. 
We believe in preventative medicine and a proactive approach, spending many decades researching natural medicines and technologies to help treat sleeping disorders. Every day we are seeing clients have incredibly positive results when they take an active approach to sleep health. So we have put together a series of articles over the next few weeks to inform, assist and inspire our loyal readers! Says Des. "The articles are designed to inform, educate and inspire people suffering from sleep problems into good health. We want more zzzzs and less grumbles! What better way than to share that information free of charge? 
Every physical human body, while sharing similar biology can have a very different internal and external environment which can impact on health and wellbeing. Treating each person rather than a blanket approach to preventative medicine is key to health improvement, according to the dedicated health practitioner . 
Des Lardner is no stranger to helping those in need, with his famous baby colic mixture becoming a household name when sold to a National Australian Pharmacy chain.
