SFR launches 4G Box for households in under-served areas Friday 23 March 2018 | 17:30 CET | News 
SFR has extended the availability of its 4G Box mobile broadband service to residential customers, after launching it in the business market last year. Unlike with the Pro version, consumers are offered a standalone broadband service, without a VoIP line. Additionally, its availability is restricted geographically to areas with poor fixed broadband speeds (less than 10 Mbps). The monthly subscription price of EUR 32.99 includes LTE-based access (theoretical speeds of 110 Mbps), a data allowance of 200 GB and the rental of a Huawei router, with no minimum contract required. 
Rivals Bouygues Telecom and Orange introduced similar services in the French residential market during the first quarter of 2017. Initially advertised without a data cap, Bouyguesâ€™ 4G Box plan has been marketed with a 200 GB allowance since January, for a monthly subscription of EUR 29.99 (plus EUR 3/month for the rental of the router). The offering from Orange , branded 4G Home, is currently priced EUR 36.99/month and includes 100 GB of data.
