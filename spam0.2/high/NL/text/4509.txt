Share on Twitter Jennifer Lopez danced through a medley of this year's hits during the 2015 American Music Awards opening number. The singer and actress is also the show's host. After teasing a slowed-down version of her Nineties hit "Waiting for Tonight," the former fly girl halted the song to announce that "tonight is about the music." Over the course of the medley, Lopez danced to many of the year's upbeat hits — Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars' "Uptown Funk," Nicki Minaj's "Anaconda," Beyonce's "7/11," the Weekend's "Can't Feel My Face" and more — as well as Ed Sheeran's loving ballad "Thinking Out Loud."
