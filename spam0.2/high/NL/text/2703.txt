IoT security spending to grow 28% in 2018   17:01 CET | News 
Nearly 20 percent of organisations observed at least one IoT-based attack in the past three years, according to a survey conducted by Gartner. To protect against those threats, researchers forecast spending on IoT security will reach USD 1.5 billion in 2018, a 28 percent increase from 2017 spending of USD 1.2 billion. Despite the steady year-over-year growth in worldwide spending, researchers predict that the main inhibitor to growth for IoT security through 2020 will come from a lack of prioritisation and implementation of security best practices and tools in IoT initiative planning. This will hamper the potential spend on IoT security by 80 percent. 
While basic security patterns have been revealed in many vertical projects, they have not yet been codified into policy or design templates to allow for consistent reuse. As a result, technical standards for specific IoT security components in the industry are only now just starting to be addressed across established IT security standards bodies, consortium organisations and vendor alliances. 
The absence of "security by design" comes from a lack of specific and stringent regulations. Going forward, researchers expect this trend to change, especially in heavily regulated industries such as healthcare and automotive. 
By 2021, researchers predict that regulatory compliance will become the prime influencer for IoT security uptake. Industries having to comply with regulations and guidelines aimed at improving critical infrastructure protection (CIP) are being compelled to increase their focus on security as a result of IoT permeating the industrial world.
