- I have no sympathy for Grayson Allen . And it is a weird spot. I-- I had Duke in my bracket. I bet on Duke to win. And I found myself-- when that shot went up from Grayson, I was rooting for him to miss.

- What he did was petty and mean-spirited. The stuff he was doing-- 
- I mean, I've-- the-- and I hated-- and I knew that if Duke made the final four, especially on a play like that, the-- the-- the-- the narrative would have been some Grayson Allen redemption story when he hasn't redeemed himself for anything. He's never fixed the behavior.
