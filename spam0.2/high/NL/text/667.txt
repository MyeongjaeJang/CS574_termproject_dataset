by Expert How to Enable Automatic Reader View in Safari for iOS 
Safari for iOS has a nifty built-in “Reader” feature that’s designed to allow Safari users to read online articles with a distraction-free design that tucks away ads and other visual clutter on supported sites. 
Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos. You can tap the Reader icon whenever you’re reading through an article to activate this mode, but there’s also a way to turn it on for all articles on a specific website or all supported articles on the web. Open up Safari. Navigate to a favorite website like MacRumors.com. Click on an article. In the navigation bar at the top, where it says “Reader View Available,” tap and hold on the icon that looks like three lines. 
From here, you’ll see a pop that says “Automatic Reader View,” with options to either enable Automatic Reader View on the website you’re currently visiting or on all websites. 
With this feature enabled, all articles that you click on for a specific website (or all websites if you chose that option) will be displayed in Reader View by default. 
You can also use Reader View on the Mac too, and your Automatic Reader preferences for Mac can be accessed by going to Preferences in the Safari Mac app and choosing “Reader” under general. You can also turn Reader on for all articles on a particular webpage by right clicking or clicking and holding on the Reader icon while visiting a website.
