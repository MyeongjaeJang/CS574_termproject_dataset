Polystar's virtualised vSolver platform chosen by European Tier 1 operator   11:18 CET | News Polystar announced that its virtualised vSolver platform was selected by an European Tier 1 operator to support rollout of VoLTE, NB-IoT and other services, across six regional markets. The new contract covers the implementation of the NFV-based vSolver in the virtualised core of each of the networks. The virtual, cloud-based architecture supported by the operator allows rapid network and service deployment, backed by elastic scale. 
To support this elasticity and operational flexibility, the operator needs a similarly scalable test platform. The vSolver platform will be deployed as a VNF (Virtual Network Function) in the NFV infrastructure and carry out functional validation as well as performance and stability regression testing. vSolver includes support for a wide range of services, including VoLTE, VoWiFi, and NB-IoT, as well as close integration with the EPC and legacy networks, such as UMTS and SS7.
