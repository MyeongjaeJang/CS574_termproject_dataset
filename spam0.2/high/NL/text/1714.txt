What it calls a ‘technical error’ has led ING bank to carry out three million banking transactions twice, the bank confirmed on Wednesday. 
In particular, the problem affected people who made payments by direct debit (pin) cards on March 19, the bank said. The double payment of a specific batch of transactions is now being reversed but customers may have to wait some time for their refund. 
Customers who are experiencing problems because of the double payment are being urged to contact the bank directly. Features
