The 245,000 square feet facility offers 16 megawatts of critical power, and is located on RagingWire's new Ashburn Data Center Campus. The VA3 Data Center is RagingWire's third data center in Ashburn, and the first building on RagingWire's new Ashburn Data Center Campus, a 78-acre parcel of land that is planned to contain seven data centers with a total of 108 megawatts of critical load and over 1 million square feet of space on a secured location. 
Construction of the new Ashburn VA4 Data Center is underway on the Ashburn Data Center Campus and is expected to be completed in 2019. Pre-leasing of VA4 is available now for 16 megawatts of critical power and 200,000 square feet of data center space, including 15,000 square feet of office space, conference rooms, and lounges. 
RagingWire's Ashburn VA3 Data Center offers options for dedicated electrical and mechanical infrastructure in each of its six private vaults, which can also be subdivided. The computer room white space features a column-free layout and high ceilings and doorways for optimal space management. For telecommunications, VA3 connects to RagingWire's other two Ashburn data centers via a private fiber optic ring, and has three entry points for more than 25 carriers and cloud providers. 
For security, VA3 features a building-within-a-building design, iris scanners, intelligent HD video cameras that analyze suspicious behavior, anti-tailgate mantraps, an anti-climb perimeter fence, and a security gate that can stop a 15,000-pound truck traveling at 30 mph, RagingWire also said. Customer amenities include office space, conference rooms and lounges, a game room, exercise room, conference center, and secured outdoor patio. 
RagingWire's VA1, VA2 and VA3 data centers in Ashburn are also connected with other RagingWire campuses in Dallas, Texas and Northern California near Silicon Valley, as well as to the company's global data center platform of over 140 data centers in more than 20 countries/regions operated under the Nexcenter brand of NTT Communications.
