The Met Announces Its First-Ever Endowed Curatorial Position for Japanese Decorative Arts Monika Bincsik Named Diane and Arthur Abbey Assistant Curator for Japanese Decorative Arts New York – WEBWIRE – Tuesday, March 20, 2018 
Daniel H. Weiss, President and CEO of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, announced today that Diane and Arthur Abbeywell-known New York collectors of Japanese bamboo arthave provided a generous gift to endow a curatorship in the Museums Department of Asian Art. In recognition of their gift, the position has been named the Diane and Arthur Abbey Curatorship for Japanese Decorative Arts. Assistant Curator Monika Bincsik, who joined the department five years ago, is the first incumbent, effective February 13, 2018. The curatorship is the first endowed position for Japanese decorative arts in the Museums history. 
We are profoundly grateful to Diane and Arthur Abbey for providing such generous support, which allows us to endow this position in our Department of Asian Art, said Mr. Weiss. Their gift helps ensure that The Met continues to be a leader in the collection, study, and presentation of the finest examples of Japanese decorative arts. 
In March 2017, the Abbeys designated more than 70 works of Japanese bamboo art as promised gifts to The Met; most of these works were featured in the recent exhibition Japanese Bamboo Art: The Abbey Collection , which was curated by Monika Bincsik. The exhibition, on view from June 13, 2017February 4, 2018, attracted more than 420,000 visitors from around the world. The Abbeys also underwrote the exhibition and its related publication. 
Diane and I are thrilled to support one of the worlds great encyclopedic art institutions in its effort to comprehensively collect and present Japanese culture from earliest times down to the present, stated Mr. Abbey.
