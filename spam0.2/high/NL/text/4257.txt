Tamedia acquires 90% of Goldbach, still awaits competition clearance Monday 26 March 2018 | 13:16 CET | News 
Tamedia has acquired 89.5 percent of the shares in Goldach Group in its public takeover bid. The offer has been extended until 11 April in order to reach a minimum 90 percent of shares, so Goldbach Group can be delisted. 
Swiss media group Tamedia announced in December an agreement on the takeover of Goldbach for CHF 216 million in order to expand in the DACH advertising market. The public bid ran from 02 February to 20 March. 
Completion of the takeover still needs approval from the competition regulator. Tameda said it expects to receive this in May, or if a second-stage investigation is opened, in September.
