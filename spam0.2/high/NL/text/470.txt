Vodafone NL partners Axians on cloud telephony services   16:33 CET | News 
Vodafone Netherlands announced an agreement to offer Omnia, the Unified Communications as a Service platform from Axians. As part of the deal, Vodafone will also outsource technical services for its Avaya managed telephony service to Axians. 
Axians said the cooperation will give customers a complete cloud telephony offering with a single contact point. Omnia offers seamless integration of fixed and mobile communications, as well as flexibility to scale the number of users on a pay-per-use basis. A selfservice portal gives customers control over their availability and profiles, without the need for active technical management. Omnia can also integrate with a range of multimedia contact centre options, cost and billing systems and Microsoft Skype for Business. 
Working with Vodafone also should help Axians expand its business with larger businesses and organisation. Free Headlines in your E-mail
