TONJ - 21 Mar 2018 Over 180 raided cattle returned to owners in Tonj 
The commissioner of Ngapagok county of Tonj State says he has handed over 187 cattle that had been raided to their rightful owners in neighboring Jal Wau county. 
Marko Madok Madhieu told Radio Tamazuj that the move is in line with governor’s orders to return all the looted properties from both the Jalwau and Thiik communities who fought recently in the area. 
“I have managed to recover 187 cows which i have officially handed over yesterday to the rightful owners of Jawau,” he said. 
Madok claims this is the second time he is returning looted cows to Jal Wau community. 
Tonj state governor Anthony Bol Madut issued a stern warning to commissioners of Ngapagok and Jalwau counties early this month to return raided cattle within two weeks.
