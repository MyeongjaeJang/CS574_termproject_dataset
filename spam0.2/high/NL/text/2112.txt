Wire Service Videocamp Film Fund Announces $400,000 Social Impact Award On the occasion of the World Down Syndrome Day, SVOD platform Videocamp has announced the launch of the Videocamp Film Fund 2018. The fund presents an award aiming to fully fund an impactful documentary, fiction or animation film on inclusive education for children with disabilities. The submission deadline is 21 June 2018. WEBWIRE – Wednesday, March 21, 2018 
The UNICEF-backed Videocamp Film Fund 2018 has been launched at the United Nations headquarters in New York with the aim of addressing and improving the situation of disabled persons in society and, particularly, in the educational sector involving children with disablities. 
Every day, people with disabilities face discrimination, little empathy and solidarity, and insufficient public policies and laws that fail to empower them as citizens, among many other challenges, Videocamp states on the funds website. Our aim is to fully fund a film that will change the conversation worldwide on the inclusion of children with disabilities in education. 
Both established and aspiring filmmakers from all over the world are eligible for submitting their work (regardless of whether the film is already in production or not). The funds submission guidlines also recommend that production teams should be diverse with good gender balance, ethnic and racial variety, and individuals with disabilities. As part of its philosophy, the fund emphasises consistency and values the entire filmmaking process, not just the final product. 
In addition to the funding support worth $400,000, Videocamp will also make the selected project available in their free catalogue of social impact films, which to date has enabled 19,000 screenings in over 90 countries. Videocamp will support the selected film to reach the widest possible audience.
