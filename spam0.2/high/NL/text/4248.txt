Parking charges could be cut for drivers of eco-friendly cars as part of the government’s plans to meet pollution targets. 
The measure is one of around 100 suggestions put forward by junior infrastructure minister Stientje van Veldhoven, together with provincial and municipal governments, to improve air quality. 
Other proposed measures include redesigning major intersections to improve traffic flow and installing more charging points for electric vehicles. 
The plans will be finalised at the end of May, once a public consultation has concluded and an economic assessment has been carried out. 
Van Veldhoven said she wanted to begin implementing the reforms ‘on the shortest timetable possible’ in order to meet European targets for air pollution and start working towards the even stricter standards set by the World Health Organization.
