Deutsche Telekom implements IoT services for Trilux lighting Wednesday 21 March 2018 | 12:48 CET | News 
Deutsche Telekom and lighting-specialist firm Trilux are cooperating to create services for networked lighting systems across Europe. Customers can monitor energy costs and optimize maintenance cycles, for example, by reading performance data from Triluxâ€™s lighting management system with the cloud-based Energy Monitoring and Light Monitoring services. The system recognizes service needs in advance and can call for repair firms to minimize maintenance costs and waiting times. Telekom has developed an intelligent plug-and-play service for Trilux that connects its lighting systems with the cloud and orients customers to a hotline where Trilux can offer its support and customer service for questions ranging from hardware to lighting for free and across Europe.
