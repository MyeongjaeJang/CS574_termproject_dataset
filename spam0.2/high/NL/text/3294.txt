0 For all the different additions made over these past six years, an equal amount of departures has been observed with the Chicago Bears. In fact, only one player from the 2012 Bears roster remains on the roster. And that player, special teams ace Sherrick McManis, will be back for two more seasons. Brad Biggs of the Chicago Tribune was the first to report the news. Originally acquired in a trade with the Houston Texans in 2012, McManis has been a staple on Chicago’s special teams. In 2017, he tied with running back Benny Cunningham for a team leading 12 tackles on special teams. He also added a blocked field goal and a fumble recovery to his stats sheet last season. McManis has seen some snaps on defense as well. He earned four starts during the 2015 regular season, and has occasionally rotated in with the corners to provide some relief. It remains to be seen if he will be asked to contribute more on defense. Chris Tabor, the Bears’ new special teams coach, will surely appreciate having a steady presence within his depth charts. It’s worth noting that McManis is the last remaining team captain from the 2017 regular season, representing the special teams units. Expect for more depth-related moves and potential re-signings to be announced in the near future.
