Bourgogne-Franche-Comte region to expand fixed LTE network in rural areas   14:10 CET | News 
The French region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comte plans to upgrade 20 additional fixed wireless masts during the current year to expand the availability of 30 Mbps broadband services in under-served areas, where the deployment of fibre access is not likely in the short to medium term. The region has already upgraded 28 fixed wireless masts under the RCube THD project , which was officially launched in January. 
The network upgrade started as part of a pilot scheme endorsed by French regulator Arcep with the allocation of LTE spectrum on a temporary basis. Bourgogne-Franche-Comte is now seeking Arcep’s authorisation to use available frequencies in the 3.5 GHz band (3410 - 3460 MHz), following the launch of a new process by the regulator to award regional licences for fixed LTE services . 
In line with the licence conditions, the upgraded masts will deliver an uncapped data service with a download speed of at least 30 Mbps and an upload speed of at least 5 Mbps (minimum 95 percent of the time), as well as a latency below 100 milliseconds. 
Bourgogne-Franche-Comte has partnered with Bouygues group’s subsidiary Axione for the deployment of a wholesale offering and a number of ISPs are already present on the new fixed LTE network (Nordnet, Alsatis and Ozone). Around 3,000 premises are currently subscribing to commercial services, including 200 business customers.
