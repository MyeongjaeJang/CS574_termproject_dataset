MTN Rwanda has launched Mobile Money (MoMo) Pay platform for its Mobile Money subscribers to pay for goods and services using their mobile wallets at no cost. Norman Munyampundu, the MTN chief business officer, said that the service is in line with the government effort to create a cashless economy. The system started with traders in Kigali City Market and in few days it will reach the whole country, according to Munyampundu. 
He added that merchants can easily calculate their outstanding balance or returns for the day. Bart Hofker, the MTN chief executive officer, said MoMo Pay system would be phased in nationwide soon, providing secure business transactions. Over 1.5 million MTN Mobile Money subscribers are targeted to use the system, and the firm is working to attract more users.
