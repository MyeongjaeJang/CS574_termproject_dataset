Virgin Media announces Scotland upgrade plans   12:45 CET | News 
Virgin Media announced new areas in Soctland where it will upgrade and expand its network this year. Under its Project Lightning programme, the areas Bathgate, Bonnyrigg, Cranhill, Joppa, Jordanhill, Kilbirnie, Kilmarnock, Shettleston and Stepps will benefit from upgrades. 
The plans were made public at a Virgin Media event in Edinburgh attended by MSP Fergus Ewing, the Scottish Government's Cabinet Secretary for the Rural Economy and Connectivity, as well as local authority representatives from across Scotland. 
Project Lightning already has connected more than 100,000 premises across Scotland to faster broadband since 2016. More than 1 million premises in Scotland are able to access Virgin Media’s top speed of 350 Mbps. 
At the event, Virgin Media also pointed to a number of challenges facing its network expansion plans and called on the Scottish government and local authorities to take action. These include the need for a new ‘notification’ wayleaves regime so that absentee landlords cannot block leaseholder access to broadband; reducing business rates to lower the cost of network roll-out; require new homes to have access to multiple broadband networks and not just BT; and allow greater flexibility in the use of narrow trenching units and operating multiple teams on site at any one time.
