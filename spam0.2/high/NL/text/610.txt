  Video: Crane Disaster at Maersk Shipyard OSS back in 1999 
19 March 2018 
Almost 20 years ago a fierce hurricane blew the existing Gantry crane of the Odense Shipyard over and completely destroyed crane. 
MAN-Takraft (now Tenova-Takraft) was contracted to design and built an new 1000 Tons Goliath gantry crane with a span of 148 m and a max. lifting height of 78 m above ground level within a period of 16 months. The 1000 tons Goliath Crane travels along a railtrack above the drydock as well as the workshops. 
The New Crane was erected by Mammoet in 2001 and still serves Lindo Industries and Bladt druing the construction of Offshore Wind Turbine foundations. 
During the past year, Bladt Industries manufactured 26 Jackets up to 1000 tons for the Beatrice Windfarm, which were loaded out onto barge using the 1000 tons Goliath Gantry crane, which has been upgraded to 1200 Tons.
