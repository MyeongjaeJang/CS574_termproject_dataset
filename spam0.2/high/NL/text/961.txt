East African ministers to meet in Kenya over Somali refugees March 20, 2018 0 
Ministers from the Eastern African regional bloc IGAD will meet in Nairobi on Thursday on the status of 1 million Somali refugees displaced by nearly three decades of fighting. 
The ministers from the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) will review progress in implementing the Nairobi Declaration and Action Plan on Durable Solutions for Somali Refugees and Reintegration of Returnees in Somalia, the bloc said in a statement issued on Monday. 
“An update report and another one on the mapping exercise of current and planned humanitarian and development investments linked to the Nairobi Plan of Action will be presented and discussed at the meeting,” IGAD said. 
IGAD said the ministers are expected to produce key actions for the implementation of the Nairobi Declaration and Plan of Action developed a year ago, as well as secure technical and financial commitments from development partners. SHARE
