The authorities in Antwerp are investigating a gang-rape involving five men raping two young Dutch women. Three suspects were arrested so far, AD reports. 
The two Dutch women, 21 and 22-years-old, went to Antwerp for the weekend, according to the newspaper. On Friday night they visited discotheque Roxy, where rapper Ronnie Flex and a number of Dutch DJ's performed. At the club, they started chatting with five men. They don't remember much more of the night, they told the police. The police believe they were drugged. 
One of the men went with them to their hotel room. It is believed he let the other four in. Around 9:30 a.m. on Saturday, the hotel receptionist saw the five men leave the hotel together. The two women got up around 10:30 a.m. They seemed disorientated, according to the hotel staff. Staff members told them about the five men. The women started remembering more of what happened, and the police were called. 
When the police arrived, it was discovered that the Dutch women's phones and money were stolen. The women pressed charges and returned to the Netherlands, according to the newspaper. 
Around 7:15 p.m. on Sunday, one of the men returned to the hotel room looking for the two women. An alert hotel worker recognized him and immediately called the owner. "I immediately came to the hotel", the owner said, according to AD. "With the help of my dangerous-looking dog, I kept the man there until the police arrived. It was 17 long minutes, but I did not let him leave. Over my dead body." 
Caroline Vanderstokker of the Public Prosecution Services confirmed to Het Nieuwsblad that three suspects were arrested. One was already arraigned, the other two will be arraigned on Monday. Tags:
