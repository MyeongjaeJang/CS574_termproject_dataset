Milan – ‘Envisioning a city designed from scratch on another planet can trigger change here on Earth,’ says Stefano Boeri, whose architecture studio is working together with space&interiors at Milan Design Week 2018. Curated by Boeri, The Future of Living and the Planet of the Future exhibition joins the exciting calendar of events to explore ideas, materials and designs for living solutions through an experiment of the imagination. 
In a world where climate change is an omnipresent topic of conversation and technological developments are exponential, human settlements on Mars – spearheaded by companies such as SpaceX – may soon no longer be just a science fiction fantasy. From 17 to 21 April, the speculative exhibition will transport visitors to the environs of the Red Planet, displaying the interior design products surrounded by 360-degree video projections of science-fiction scenes directed by Davide Rapp and Giorgio Zangrandi. The immersive atmosphere features an interplay of surreal and futuristic concepts with realistic possibilities, encouraging new perspectives – which Boeri hopes will serve as a catalyst for change. 
Visit space&interiors at Fuorisalone – Design Week, from 17 - 21 April 2018 between the hours of 14:30 - 21:30. Entrance is free, with registration online.
