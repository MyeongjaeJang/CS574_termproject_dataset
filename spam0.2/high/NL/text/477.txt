Toyota’s basketball robot is why humans should give up and go home March 19, 2018 by Sam Francis 
If you find being confronted by a 7-foot human basketball player somewhat intimidating, wait ’til you see the new Toyota basketball-playing robot. 
Luckily, the 6-foot-3-inch monstrosity doesn’t move around at all and only throws the ball into the hoop – but it does so with 100 per cent accuracy. (See video below.) 
According to Asahi Shimbun via CNBC, ZDNet and others, the robot – named “Cue” for some reason – threw 200,000 hoops with almost perfect accuracy. 
Cue uses a range of technologies, including light detection and ranging as well as stereo vision and an electronic rangefinder. 
While some may argue that shooting hoops from a stationary position is a lot less complicated than scoring points while on the move in various parts of the basketball court, not many teams would turn down a player who can virtually guarantee points from within the free-throw circle. Share this:
