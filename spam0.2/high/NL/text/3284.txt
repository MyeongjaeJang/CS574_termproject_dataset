Scott Quigg slams Carl Frampton for talking “a load of bollocks” By Joe O'Neill   Headline News 
Scott Quigg has lashed out at former foe Carl Frampton after ‘The Jackal’ labelled him disrespectful. 
The comments from Frampton came following Quigg’s fight with WBO featherweight champion Oscar Valdez. The English boxer lost an exciting twelve-round slugfest but had made waves the previous day when he missed weight by a whopping 2.8lbs. 
Quigg and his team claimed that this was due to a fractured right foot suffered in the build-up which prevented him from training at the intensity required to make weight but, writing in his weekly column for the Sunday Life , Frampton questioned this. 
The two-weight world champion felt the Bury boxer may have intentionally come in heavy to obtain an unfair advantage over the Mexican, whose jaw he broke during the fight. Widgets Magazine 
The Belfast 31-year-old seemed disgusted at his former foe’s behaviour – with Quigg also refusing a next day weigh-in – and Frampton described how he “acted in a totally disrespectful manner to his opponent Óscar Valdez and the sport of boxing.” 
Quigg would soon learn the contents of Frampton’s article and he strongly dismissed the Queensberry fighter’s claims 
In an interview with IFL TV, Quigg slammed Frampton, stating how “he goes and writes an article which was a load of bollocks.” 
“It’s irrelevant, really, he just needs to concentrate on Donaire – not talk a load of nonsense, talk a load of shit.” 
“If he wants to settle it, we can settle it in the ring again,” added Quigg who remains extremely keen for a rematch following his points loss to Frampton at the Manchester Arena two years ago.
