Elliott, independent directors mulling complaint over Vivendi's TIM move - report Monday 26 March 2018 | 08:59 CET | News 
Activist investor Elliott Management together with statutory auditors and independent directors at Telecom Italia (TIM) are considering filing a complaint to the government or markets regulator Consob over Vivendi’s move to trigger the resignations of 8 directors, according to sources cited by Il Corriere della Sera. The news comes after 8 Vivendi-backed directors including TIM chairman and Vivendi CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine surprisingly resigned last week, prompting the postponement of the company’s 24 April AGM. Shareholders have now been called to vote for a new board on 04 May. 
In a strongly-worded statement, Elliott issued a statement describing the action as “cynical and self-serving, in that it delays the ability of Telecom Italia shareholders to express their votes at the upcoming AGM.” The fund, which has built up a 5.75 percent stake in TIM, added that the board has shown itself “unable to advance any meritorious arguments” and “has simply abandoned their posts to stall for time." Under Italian law, if the majority of a board resigns, it is has to be dissolved. Each side can subsequently present a slate of at least 10 directors for the company’s 15-member board, with the side that prevails in the shareholder vote granted two-thirds of the seats on the board.
