Sul New York Times Thomas Friedman spiega secondo quale meccanismo, a suo avviso, si siano mossia sia Donald Trump, sia Vladimir Putin negli ultimi anni: 
Many years ago, the Israeli Bedouin expert Clinton Bailey told me a story about a Bedouin chief who discovered one day that his favorite turkey had been stolen. He called his sons together and told them: “Boys, we are in great danger now. My turkey’s been stolen. Find my turkey.” His boys just laughed and said, “Father, what do you need that turkey for?” and they ignored him. 
A few weeks later the Bedouin chief’s camel was stolen. His sons went to him and said, “Father, your camel has been stolen. What should we do?” And the chief answered, “Find my turkey.” 
A few weeks later the chief’s horse was stolen, and again his sons asked what they should do. “Find my turkey,” the chief said. 
Finally, a few weeks later his daughter was abducted, at which point he gathered his sons and told them: “It’s all because of the turkey! When they saw that they could take my turkey, we lost everything.”
