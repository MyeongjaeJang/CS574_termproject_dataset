Comviq makes 'double data' offer permanent Thursday 22 March 2018 | 13:39 CET | News 
Tele2 Sweden's budget mobile arm, Comviq, said it is making the double data promotion that it began last August a permanent service. The 'Dubbel Surf' deal was originally intended to run until the end of 2017, and provided twice as much internet service as the normal allowance under each subscription, at no extra cost. The promotion was in response to rising demand for data. 
The popularity of the promotion then led Comviq to extend it until Easter, but it is now making it permanent. Double data comes with "almost every price plan", said Comviq. It now even applies to cash card customers, said the operator. 
Comviq's old 20 GB service used to supply 20 GB for use in Sweden, including 9 GB for EU roaming, at SEK 295 per month. It now supplies 40 GB, of which 10 GB can be used in the EU. It also allows unlimited voice calls, SMS and MMS. 
The service that used to provide 8 GB, all of which could be used in the EU, now delivers 10 GB. The price is SEK 195 a month. 
Comviq is now delivery 5 GB instead of 2 GB for SEK 145 monthly. All of this can be used in the EU. This, too, also allows unlimited calls, texts and MMS. 
The mini subscription costs SEK 95 monthly and supplies 200 voice minutes, 2,000 SMS/MMS, and 3 GB for surfing instead of 2 GB, but this can only be used in Sweden. Free Headlines in your E-mail
