WhatsApp founder calls for Facebook users to quit social network   10:35 CET | News 
Calls for Facebook users to stop using the social network are increasing after news the company allowed user data to be used for election campaigning without informed consent. Brain Action, the co-founder of WhatsApp who sold the messaging app to Facebook, said on Twitter "It is time. #deletefacebook". 
Action left Facebook in 2017 and has since focused on setting up his own ventures. He is a backer of the Signal messaging app , which promotes encrypted, open-source messaging software. 
Facebook's share price fell for a second day, by 2.6 percent on 20 March, after the scandal broke . In addition, the Facebook shareholder Fan Yuan filed a lawsuit in California against the company, accusing Facebook of making "materially false and/or misleading" claims about the companyâ€™s handling of user data, Gizmodo was the first to report. He is seeking class-action status for the lawsuit so other Facebook shareholders can join.
