Thai Tourism Awaits 530,000 Foreign Tourists For The Thai New Year tourism-review.com 
Thai tourism authorities announced that more than 530,000 foreign tourists are expected in Thailand to enjoy the festivities of Songkran, the Thai New Year, generating an income of 9 billion baht (about $290 million). 
This year the government has decided to add an additional day off (April 12th) and Thais will therefore enjoy five full days of vacation, from April 12th to 16th (April 13th is the date that traditionally marks the Thai New Year). 
Thai travelers are expected to make up to 3 million trips themselves and spend 10 billion baht during the five-day holiday.
