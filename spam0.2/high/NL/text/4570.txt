The best Intel X299 motherboards These are the best choices for Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X! By Reinoud Dik Monday March 26, 2018 11:59 PM Introduction 
More than half a year ago, Intel introduced their Core-X processors and the accompanying X299 chip set in the summer of 2017. Since then we've done the necessary round-ups and reviews, but if you're buying a Intel high-end processor, which X299 motherboard should you get? For those who don't have time to backtrack through all of our old reviews, this article lists the best choices for those looking for a motherboard for an Intel Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X processor. X299: Things you have to know 
Intel's high-end platform utilizes socket 2066, which can be found on motherboards with the X299 chipset. These X299 motherboards are characterised by many connection options, with many pci-e and memory slots. How much you can use depends on the processor you choose. The X299 chipset does not have a built-in usb 3.1 controller, so for that functionality manufacturers use additional chips, which drive up the price. This also applies to Thunderbolt 3.0: apart from a few exceptions, this interface is not found at all on X299 motherboards. The Intel X299 chip set 
Although there are many processors compatible with X299 motherboards, not all of them are a smart choice. This is because, in addition to this high-end platform, Intel also has a so-called mainstream platform, with socket 1151 (v2) motherboards based on (among other things) the Z370 chipset. The development of these is always a bit more advanced than of high-end products, and since the eighth generation of Core processors with the code name Coffee Lake , a number of processors from the somewhat older high-end platform have been overtaken in quality. Socket 2066: a lot of processors 
So there is a wide range of processors for socket 2066 with the X299 chip set, ranging from the Core i5 7640X with 4 cores and 4 threads, priced at 283 dollars, to the Core i9 7980XE , which with 18 cores and 36 threads passes the counter for 2400 dollars. We advise against the entry-level processors from this platform, because they do not offer any added value compared to their counterparts for the mainstream socket 1151 platform (more below). 
However, the larger Skylake-X processors are worth considering if you often have to process heavy workloads, which require a lot of cores and threads. In addition, it is important to note that Intel has two sets of processors within Skylake-X, the i7 7800X, i7 7820X and i9 7900X with six, eight and ten cores on the one hand, and the so-called high-core count Core i9 models 7920X, 7940X, 7960X and 7980X with 12,14,16 and 18 calculation cores on the other. The usage of Kaby Lake-X CPUs limits the possibilities of X299 motherboards considerably. Processor determines possibilities 
Although the Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X processors fit on the same socket 2066, you have to take restrictions into account with the latter series. First, there is maximum support for dual-channel memory: only Skylake-X has a quad-channel memory controller. Therefore, in the case of the i5 7640X and i7 7740X, you cannot use half of the memory slots. Secondly, the number of PCI-e lanes at Kaby Lake-X is limited to 16, while Skylake-X has 28 or 44, depending on the processor model. On many X299 motherboards, a PCI-e lock is therefore unusable when you have a Kaby Lake-X processor in place.
