INEOS announces progress on VAM project in Europe WEBWIRE – Monday, March 26, 2018 
INEOS Oxide announces that it has made further progress in developing its project to produce Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM) in Europe. A MOU has been signed with an as yet unnamed commercial partner and FEED studies have commenced. 
The plant will be located at one of INEOS Oxides European sites, either in Saltend, Hull, UK or Zwijndrecht, Antwerp, Belgium, and will use proprietary fixed bed technology with an initial nameplate capacity of 300,000 tonnes per year. Both locations benefit from advantaged feedstock supplies and are well positioned to supply both the European and deep-sea VAM markets efficiently. The partners will complete the engineering studies required to make the final decision in 2018, targeting to start construction in 2019 and operation in early 2021. 
Graham Beesley, CEO INEOS Oxide, commented  we are pleased to be moving forward with this exciting project and are highly encouraged with the marketplace interest in a plan to increase VAM supply in Europe. We are now entering the next phase of selecting the preferred location for the project and are fortunate to have two great options in Antwerp and Hull 
