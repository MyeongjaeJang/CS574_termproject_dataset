Asia Satellite Telecommunications Company (AsiaSat) and Television New Zealand (TVNZ) collaborated to deliver live coverage of the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games via AsiaSat 5. This collaboration is integral to TVNZ’s extensive plan of providing the largest-ever free to air coverage of the Games in New Zealand and enabling broadcast rights-holders in the Asia-Pacific region to have full access to the event’s live coverage and daily highlight packages. The Games will take place on the 4th to 15th of April in Australia’s Gold Coast. 
Commonwealth Games coverage by TVNZ, New Zealand’s leading free to air broadcaster, will be distributed through AsiaSat 5’s wide C-band beam to rights-holding broadcasters in Asia in partnership with the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union and TVNZ’s sub-licensees in the Pacific region. 
Event coverage will include the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as 11 days of live and replayed television action. As the exclusive broadcast rights holder for New Zealand, TVNZ will deliver live coverage, replays and highlights across TVNZ 1, TVNZ Duke, new pop-up channel Games Extra and fully streamed channel Games Online for sports fans.
