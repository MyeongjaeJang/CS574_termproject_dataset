Smart powers Red Cross-Nokia disaster response system in Philippines Monday 26 March 2018 | 16:08 CET | News PLDT’s mobile unit Smart Communications has announced that it will provide connectivity for a drone system designed to boost the disaster response efforts of the Philippine Red Cross. The drone system, which will operate on Smart’s frequencies during times of emergency, is part of Nokia Saving Lives, a program that aims to provide communications services and technical assistance to emergency response teams. 
The system consists of drones, a portable data center, a mobile broadband network, and applications like video streaming, gas sensing, mapping, and analytics, which can help Red Cross responders assess current status of lifelines and analyze immediate needs and gaps. This will enable Red Cross to provide emergency assistance to communities in more timely and efficient ways. 
Using Smart’s LTE connectivity and Nokia’s portable Ultra Compact Network, the system can also create a secure communication between drones, other equipment, and rescue team members. The drone can be equipped with different types of cameras, sensors and speakers, and can also be used to carry first aid kits. The portable data center, meanwhile, is a computing and storage unit that can be used for immediate data analysis.
