NXP, Google co-design m-ticketing platform for public transportation, Las Vegas first to adopt it   14:13 CET | News 
NXP Semiconductors collaborated with Google to create an integrated mobile ticketing platform for public transportation. The first deployment of this integrated platform went live on 19 March with the Las Vegas Monorail. The platform integrates NXP's new Mifare 2Go cloud service with Google Pay. It allows commuters to purchase tickets on their phones through the Monorail site, save them to their Google Pay app and wave their phone on the terminal to ride. 
The Google Pay platform offers rich features such as a map of the transit stations related to their ticket and digital receipts of their travel history. NXP's cloud service manages digitised Mifare-based credentials onto mobile and wearable devices. It's designed to work with existing Mifare contactless technology infrastructures and meet industry requirements for security and scalability. Available to transit agencies across the globe, it allows public transport operators to define their fare concepts and provide additional value to their customers by integrating additional city services even if they are from third party providers (such as bike sharing, parking, among others). 
The platform can leverage hardware security in the form of a tamper-resistant Secure Element (SE) in combination with a cloud-based risk mitigation engine to provide the necessary security for mass adoption of this platform by transit agencies and OEMs. 
For mobile devices, Common Criteria EAL5+ SE+NFC products from NXP can be used as a high-level security protection enclave.
