Coimbatore: Students and the administration of VLB Janakiammal College of Arts and Science here were in for a rude shock on Saturday morning when they received a circular stating that anyone who copied the viral eye wink of teenage sensation Priya Prakash Warrier would be debarred from college for a year. Students of the college group, which has branches all over the State, were left confused even as the management began its culprit-hunt since the circular was a `handiwork’ of some students. 
Principal N Raja Kumar said, “We had issued a circular in 2017 during Jallikattu stating that only fresh juice would be served instead of foreign soft drinks but miscreants used technology like photoshop to change it. They literally erased those lines and instead added these lines which mention about the Priya Warrier eye wink.” A complaint had been lodged. “If culprits are our own students, then there will be an inquiry on what needs to be done further,” he added. 
The news was fake and some outsiders could also be involved in the manipulation, the principal said. Asked how he came to know about the incident, he was quick to shoot back that Facebook and Whatsapp were most popular social networking sites among youth today. 
The sites were often misused for conducting such anti-social activities which hampered the smooth functioning of the college as well as the bond existing between students and college administration. A newspaper had an article on this and removed it when it was known that it was fake, he added. ALSO READ
