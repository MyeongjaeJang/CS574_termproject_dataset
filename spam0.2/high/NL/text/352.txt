Telefonica given 15 days to communicate wholesale fibre price   14:10 CET | News 
Spanish regulator CNMC has given Telefonica 15 days to communicate to its rivals the price of accessing its wholesale fibre network. Following a consultation, the regulator announced at the end of last year that the wholesale fibre access price would be lowered to a maximum of EUR 16.38 month from the current EUR 19.93 per month but the former incumbent has yet to confirm that figure. It now has until 04 April to inform the CNMC of the price of providing the so-called NEBA local wholesale service pursuant to the provisions of the broadband regulation approved in 2016. Under those rules, Telefonica is obliged to provide virtual access to its fibre network throughout Spain, except in the 66 municipalities deemed more competitive by the regulator. The operator has already reached fibre access deals corresponding to 65 percent of the country with its main rivals Vodafone and Orange .
