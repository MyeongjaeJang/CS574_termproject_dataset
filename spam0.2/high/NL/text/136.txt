Hamas shuts Wataniya Mobile in Gaza for failing to provide data after attack on prime minister   09:19 CET | News 
Hamas has closed the offices of Wataniya Mobile in the Gaza Strip for failing to co-operate in an investigation into the apparent assassination attempt against Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah on 13 March, reports The National. Hamdallah, who is based in the occupied West Bank, survived a roadside bomb that blew up near his motorcade during a rare visit to the Hamas-held Gaza Strip. 
Hamas police spokesman Ayman Batniji said that Wataniya Mobile, a subsidiary of Qatar's Ooredoo, was being shut down for "refusing to co-operate" in the probe. The statement did not provide further details, and there was no immediate response from the telecommunications firm. 
Pan-Arab daily Asharq Al Awsat said the telecommunications company refused to comply with the prosecutor's order to disclose data and the names of suspects. There has been no claim of responsibility for the bomb attack, but Hamas has made a number of arrests.
