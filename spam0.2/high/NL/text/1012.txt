Temptation is a fully custom motor yacht built by Palmer Johnson in America in 2005. Launched as Alter Ego and later renamed Finish Line , the yacht was sold mid 2017 to her current owner after the yacht was listed for sale at $5,900,000. She has retained her sporty Nuvolari Lenard design who also created the interior of this popular charter yacht who underwent a refit in 2012.
