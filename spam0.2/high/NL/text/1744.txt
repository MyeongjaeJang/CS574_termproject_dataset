First Atari console in 20 years has a name by Email 
Atari VCS expected to be seen later this week The new Ataribox which no one knows much about has been officially named the Atari VCS, which still no one knows much about. 
Atari unveiled the console's name today alongside two controller prototypes and an official logo. One controller is a joystick reminiscent of the Atari 2600's, while another resembles a modern Xbox controller, complete with asymmetrical analog sticks and ABXY buttons. 
A preorder date for Atari VCS will be revealed in April. It will be a "retro-inspired gaming and entertainment platform" and it was previously known as Ataribox, first teased at last year's E3. 
Atari later told us that it would be a "full PC experience for the TV, bringing you streaming, applications, social, browsing, music, and more". 
Atari VCS will support pre-loaded retro Atari games, as well as "current titles from a range of studios". 
Atari VCS will be shown off this week during GDC. Last modified on
