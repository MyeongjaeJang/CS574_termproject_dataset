The women said they were attacked after meeting five men in a nightclub. 
Three men have been arrested after two Dutch women reported they had been drugged and raped on a night out in Antwerp. 
The women, aged 21 and 22, told police they were in the Roxy nightclub on Friday where they fell into conversation with a group of five men. ‘After that it’s a black hole,’ they said in a police statement. 
Police suspect they were drugged and taken back to their hotel by one of the men, who let his companions in. When the women awoke the next morning they realised they had been raped and their mobile phones and money had been stolen. 
According to the Telegraaf one of the men was arrested when he returned to the hotel the next evening and inquired after the women. A receptionist had seen the five men leaving the hotel at around 7.30am that morning. The women are said to have identified him as the man who accompanied them from the nightclub to the hotel.
