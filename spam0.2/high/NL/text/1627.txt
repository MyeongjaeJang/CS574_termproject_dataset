UK regions need 'brain gain' policies to retain digital workers - study   10:41 CET | News 
Research from Vodafone shows that UK towns and cities outside London could boost growth and productivity by implementing 'brain gain' policies to attract and retain digital talent. These policies would help drive regional growth and spark a digital revolution across the whole of the UK, allowing towns and cities to fully exploit the economic and social benefits of new digital technology. 
Data from Higher Educational Statistical Agency shows that over 100,000 people have left the regions they lived and studied in within six months of graduating in order to work elsewhere, with London being the main beneficiary of this 'brain drain'. The Vodafone report recommended various policies to help regions attract and retain highly qualified workers. It also shows that upgrading the country's digital infrastructure is vital for encouraging highly-skilled workers to return to regional towns and cities to start-up businesses. 
These include national and local audit of unused or underused public buildings which could be turned into low-cost offices for digital start-ups; a commitment from universities to allow students to use their buildings to start-up businesses for 12 months after graduation; and allowing funds raised from the Apprenticeship Levy to retrain and upskill people returning to work after a career break.
