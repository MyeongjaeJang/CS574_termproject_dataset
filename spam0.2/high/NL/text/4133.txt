KDDI, Samsung Electronics complete 5G field trial in Japan  46 CET | News 
KDDI and Samsung Electronics completed a 5G field trial held in Okinawa Cellular Stadium, a 30,000-person capacity baseball stadium in Japan. The trial demonstrated the ways in which users will be able to simultaneously access 5G networks and enjoy immersive experiences regardless of their location. Using Samsung’s 5G products spanning virtualised core, virtualised RAN, one of the smallest 5G access units, and multiple prototype 5G tablet devices, the trial showcased a live feed of 4K video contents downloaded and streamed simultaneously on 5G tablets supporting the millimeter wave spectrum. This is the first time to test 5G performance using 5G tablets in Japan. 
Samsung’s 5G access units with beam-forming technology were installed on a light tower located outside the left field fence to create 5G coverage in the direction of home plate and first and third bases. As a result, the tablets placed on seats in this coverage area were able to have 4K videos downloaded and streamed on them via 5G. 
The successful trial results reflect the two companies’ efforts in using 5G technology and ultra-high frequency spectrum (28GHz band in this instance), to redefine user experiences in crowded environments and spotlight a new approach to viewing sports games. 
The outcome of this 5G stadium trial connotes advanced connectivity, not only at sports events, but also in a wide variety of crowded entertainment spots, including live music concerts, exhibitions, and international conferences, leading to new viewing experiences. 
KDDI and Samsung have been working closely since 2015 to demonstrate the performance of 5G in various real-life scenarios.
