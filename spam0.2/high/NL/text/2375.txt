WightFibre has confirmed the initial pilot areas for the new Gigabit Island project, as well the appointment of several new directors. 
The Gigabit Island project aims to roll out gigabit, full fibre broadband to more than 50,000 homes and businesses across the Isle of Wight. Gurnard Pines will be one of the first areas to get the new Gigabit broadband service. In addition, the Staplers area of Newport will be the first new WightFibre area, with fibre-optic cables being laid to around 400 homes during April and May 2018. The full roll-out of the network will commence in the summer, creating around 20 new permanent jobs, as well as around 120 new temporary jobs during the network build. 
WightFibre has appointed Steve Cooper as Director responsible for overseeing the build of the new island-wide network; David Winfield as the new Programme Director for the construction programme; Simon Poole as Operations Director responsible for all customer-facing operations at the company; and Richard Reis as Business Development Director to work with new property developments, private landlords and housing associations.
