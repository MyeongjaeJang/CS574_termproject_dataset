has a 4.8-star rating on Amazon.com. Heres what some people are saying: I liked the simple explanations for more complex/esoteric Chinese concepts of Yin and Yang. Also the parables about the lost horse and the donkey in the well were extremely illustrative of the authors point without belaboring the concept. I liked that the chapters were titled "Fun Game #4, Fun Game #5, and so on, it drew me through the book and made the interaction fun and inspiring. The author simplified the concepts and provided helpful methods to guage ones balance in life and find balance and happiness with ease. A fun read.  Gabrielle Siman I believe we are all in pursuit of happiness, and Jennifer Yus, as Mama Panda, has cast Tai Chi as the way to find it. I enjoyed reading Happy. I appreciate her approach to teaching the concepts behind the practice of Tai Chi, like Yin and Yang. Happiness can be elusive. I found myself smiling often while reading Happy!  Bren Besser For more questions or to schedule an interview about this press release please contact us at (626) 765-9750 or email info@bestsellerpublishing.org .
