Even successful designers were once starting out on their career, and they know how difficult it is to gain access to the creative industry. The Red Dot: Junior Award aims to help young people get a foothold in the industry, explains Professor Dr. Peter Zec, founder and CEO of the Red Dot Award. When they have the opportunity to try out their ideas and make them a reality, this results in wonderful achievements, the design expert says. 
The Red Dot Jury is made up of 24 experts who assess, discuss and evaluate all of the works individually. They award the Red Dot for good design achievements and the Red Dot: Best of the Best for works of very high design quality. But only one project receives the Red Dot: Junior Prize. The award includes prize money of 10,000 Euros and is awarded by the jurors to the best piece of work by an up-and-coming designer. The winner will be announced on 26 October 2018 at the award ceremony in the Konzerthaus Berlin in Germany.
