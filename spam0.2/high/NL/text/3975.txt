Telstra stops providing Premium Direct Billing service  30 CET | News Telstra has announced that it has ceased providing its Premium Direct Billing (PDB) service. The operator has also reached an agreement with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in Court proceedings relating to PDB. Telstra has agreed with the ACCC to jointly submit to the Federal Court that the operator pay a penalty relating to the management of its PDB service. 
The Premium Direct Billing service enabled Telstra mobile customers to buy content such as games, apps or videos from third parties by subscribing or purchasing online and have it charged to their mobile phone bill. 
Following Telstraâ€™s decision to stop providing new subscription based services in December, from earlier this month the operator has completely exited this service. 
Telstra also reports that its number one priority right now is working to continue to identify customers who have been impacted through being charged for third party PDB subscriptions, they either did not knowingly subscribe to or had tried to opt out of unsuccessfully. Telstra has a dedicated team working through this and it will start contacting these customers from next week.
