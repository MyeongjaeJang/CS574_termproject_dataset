Share on: google + As that sun sneaks out, you know that Spring is (finally) approaching. As much as we say ‘it’s fun to layer up’ when it comes to winter fashion, after what feels like six months of cold weather, you start to miss being able to throw on much more simple outfits. If you caught this Champion and Supreme collab, you’ll be sorted in terms of lightweight jackets for the turning of the seasons. The famous streetwear brand and one of the most loved sportswear brands thanks to a recent resurgence, Supreme and Champion is a partnership that makes a lot of sense. They’re both masters of the simple design and 90s steeze, and that really comes across in this dope new drop. Waterproofed for those April showers and warm enough for the winds, these pieces are as functional as they are swaggy. They come in some understated like the black, or some outlandish ones like the fluorescent colourway, too. With pairing tracksuit bottoms, these could create one of the looks of the season for streetwear and sportswear fans, but as per from Supreme, production is limited and supply is high. But that only further reinstates the strength of these ‘Preme x Champion pieces.
