WebOS enters next phase as global platform under LG'S stewardship  44 CET | News LG Electronics (LG) entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with a federal government body in South Korea to seek local start-ups that want to use its webOS smart devices platform. With the MoU, LG said it wants to more actively advance its philosophy of open platform, open partnership and open connectivity. LG said it will solicit webOS business proposals from hundreds of start-ups recommended by the National IT Industry Promotion Agency (NIPA) and shortlist the most viable ones to provide logistical and technical support with commercialisation as the ultimate goal. With LG’s backing, startups will take part in international events such as Open Source Summit and OSCON to share their ideas and initiatives with other industry influencers.
NIPA is the governmental body within South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT (Information and Communication Technology) responsible for developing the country’s IT sector. 
To expand the webOS global footprint, LG developed an open source version of its platform, webOS Open Source Edition, which is now available to the public at http://webosose.org. Developers can download the source code free as well as use related tools, guides and forums on the site to become more familiar with webOS and its inherent benefits as a smart devices platform . And because webOS is a Linux-kernel-based multitasking OS with support for HTML5 and CSS3, webOS will be quite familiar to even new developers.
