Wire Service Snow-Place Like Martinsville Wintery weather plagued Martinsville, Virginia over the weekend, pushing back both NASCAR races to Monday where Toyota drivers earned a pair of runner-up finishes in the double-header event. Meanwhile, NASCAR Xfinity Series (NXS) regular Christopher Bell took advantage of his off-weekend to return to his racing roots and earn two national midget car wins in his native Oklahoma. WEBWIRE – Tuesday, March 27, 2018 MENCS MVL Busch 
MENCS Camry driver Kyle Busch finished second to Clint Bowyer in Mondays snow-delayed Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series (MENCS) race. It was his third runner-up result in the last four races of the season. With the second-place finish, the Las Vegas native takes over the series points lead. The fact that were a championship-caliber team with myself, Adam (Stevens, crew chief) of course and my guys, Busch said, after Mondays race. We have to keep executing and doing a good job. Thats what were doing right now, its just not working our way. The M&Ms Caramel Camry was really close today. After weather canceled MENCS qualifying for the weekend, Martin Truex Jr. started out front with Busch alongside him, going on to finish fourth. It was Truex fifth-consecutive top-five or better finish. Camry driver Denny Hamlin led 111 laps and won the events first stage before finishing 12th on Monday. It was Hamlins first stage win of 2018. NCWTS In his first-ever NASCAR Camping World Truck Series (NCWTS) race, Tundra driver Kyle Benjamin scored a runner-up finish to John Hunter Nemechek at Martinsville on Monday. He led 74 laps (of 250) and was one of four Tundra drivers to finish in the top-10 in the weather-delayed race, along with Brett Moffitt (third), Noah Gragson (fifth) and Harrison Burton (eighth). This was the first time since 1993 that NASCAR delayed a race due to snow.
