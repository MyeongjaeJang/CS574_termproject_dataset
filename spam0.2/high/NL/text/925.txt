Germany’s government has expressed doubts that the European Union will be exempt from US President Donald Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs. Deputy Foreign Minister Michael Roth said on Tuesday: “We are skeptical, but will hope to the end that there is a good solution,” AP reports. Roth expressed concern about Trump’s “dogmatic and ideological decision,” saying that “we are at the moment… a long way from a sensible solution.” The comments came as EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom headed to Washington to seek an exemption from the tariffs for the entire 28-nation bloc.
