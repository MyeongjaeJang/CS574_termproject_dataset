Telkom says it acted within law when awarding security deal, case to be heard early 2019   09:19 CET | News 
Telkom has declined to comment on a Sunday Independent report concerning its award of a ZAR 755 million security contract, as it is currently before the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria. The company said that it acted in line with the law, and that the case is expected to be heard in early 2019. The newspaper cited sources at Telkom as saying two managers bypassed procurement processes. 
The Sunday Independent reported its sources as saying two senior managers used underhanded tactics to ensure their preferred companies were awarded the contract. It is alleged the two managers bypassed procurement processes to award the bulk of the contract to two companies that the sources said do not meet the requirements of the tender. 
According to the report, documents regarding the tender reveal that Telkom used the services of KPMG in 2016 to identify service providers that would be suitable to bid in a closed tender for physical guarding and network protection services. Among the criteria Telkom provided to KPMG were industry overview, supply market analysis, competitor key client overview, best practice contracting models, and SWOT analysis on key suppliers. 
In August 2016, KPMG identified 21 service providers that Telkom could invite to tender. Telkomâ€™s subject matter evaluation team reviewed the recommendations, and seven companies were found to be suitable. The two Telkom managers accused of manipulating the tender process added three companies not included on the approved list, based on their industry knowledge. Ultimately, nine companies were then invited to bid on the contract. 
The Telkom subject matter evaluation team then shortlisted three companies, before the two implicated companies were awarded the bulk of the contract, according to the report.
