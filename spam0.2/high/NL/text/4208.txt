AT&T partners ONF to integrate ONAP with multi-gigabit PON trials   12:18 CET | News 
AT&T and the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) announced a collaboration to integrate the ONF's work on multi-gigabit passive optic networks (PON) with the service automation system ONAP. The effort will integrate VOLTHA (Virtual Optical Line Termination Hardware Abstraction), the open source software stack powering PON networks, with ONAP. 
AT&T said the idea is to develop virtualized and disaggregated network access for PON networks. The integration will build upon AT&T's ongoing field trials of XGS-PON , which is a fixed wavelength symmetrical 10Gbps PON technology. It also builds upon previous GPON and CORD trials. 
The current XGS-PON trial is testing multi-gigabit high-speed internet traffic, including delivery of the streaming service AT&T DirecTV Now. To build the network, AT&T used an OCP-accepted white box OLT, an ONF SDN controller that hosts virtual OLT control applications, a virtual broadband network gateway application to manage subscribers and a VOLTHA for OLT devices. VOLTHA, the software powering the PON network trials, was developed by an ONF project community and used the latest in DevOps techniques to enable rapid prototyping and accelerated delivery to the field trial. AT&T's Foundry in Atlanta developed the vBNG software and AT&T provided overall system integration and field operations for the trial.
