Share on: google + Two brands from two different worlds have combined here, as streetwear legends, Bathing Ape collab with iconic sportswear brand, FILA, to rework a classic tennis show from the latter. BAPE‘s diffusion line ‘AAPE’ is what they’ve used here to play around with this staple silhouette from the Italian brand. The mainly white colourway sees a leather upper accented with a helping of AAPE’s signature camouflage pattern on the back of the shoe, wrapping around the heel and both of the sides. AAPE branding can be seen, etched carefully on the laces, eyelets, just above the midsole and heel counter. Meanwhile, a really special AAPE by A Bathing APE x FILA logo can be found on the tongue tab, as the two brands meet at the very heart of this eye-catching trainer. These will come packaged in a special edition box, graced by both the labels’ branding as seen in the image below. However, as sick as these are, there’s no indication as to when these will be available to buy. So keep an eye on them and don’t let their camo print let them lose you.
