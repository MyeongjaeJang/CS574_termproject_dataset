Tiscali postpones approval of 2017 results Monday 19 March 2018 | 10:54 CET | News 
Italian operator Tiscali has announced that its board of directors has decided to postpone the approval of the company's 2017 financial results to a subsequent board meeting. The company said the delay was due to its need to complete preparation of a new business plan for the years 2018-2021, described as an essential part of the approval process. Tiscali added that the guidelines of the business plan were approved at a 16 March meeting but its final approval would take place in conjunction with that of the 2017 draft budget. 
Another board meeting has been scheduled for 27 April, while a shareholders' meeting originally scheduled for that date has been postponed and will be held prior to 29 June 2018, said the operator. Tiscali reported revenues of EUR 103.6 million in the six months to 30 June 2017, a 6.9 percent year on year rise. Itâ€™s currently waiting to hear from communications watchdog Agcom on its request for a 6-year extension to licences to use frequencies in the 3.4-3.6 GHz range. Free Headlines in your E-mail
