Digita, Soficta enable buildings monitoring for Salo city council using LoRaWAN Tuesday 20 March 2018 | 12:20 CET | News 
Finnish operator Digita said it has provided software company Soficta with wireless sensors and LoRaWan connectivity to supply Soficta’s energy efficiency system Aistio to Salo city council. Aistio will be phased in at properties managed by Salo municipal administration, covering 185 sites initially. Last summer, Digita installed a LoRaWAN base station at the Salo IoT Campus. 
The Aistio system is used to monitor energy consumption at buildings live. Sami Metsanpera, CEO of Soficta, said Digita is the Finnish software firm’s main sensor supplier, and their cooperation has got off to a good start. A particularly positive aspect has been that if a customer is located at an area without coverage, Digita has promised to supply a network for the site. 
Mika Flinck, head of sales at Digita, said the operator’s IoT network offers the opportunity to carry out short-term, efficient IoT pilot projects in various industries. 
Aistio features indoor climate condition monitoring to identify discrepancies and issues related to air conditioning. Sensors connected to Digita's LoRaWAN grid collect data that is then processed in the Aistio system and used to monitor energy consumption, sparing the need for traditional on-site measurement visits. 
Aistio provides information for building automation systems, which can be used in property management. Sensors collect information on matters such as heating, water and electricity consumption, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels.
