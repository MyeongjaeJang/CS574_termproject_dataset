Of things unknown but longed for still 
And his tune is heard on the distant hill 
For the caged bird sings of freedom

Gently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind; 
Quietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave. 
I know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned 
‘Dirge Without Music’, Edna St. Vincent Millay

Or bends with the remover to remove: 
O no; it is an ever-fixed mark, 
That looks on tempests, and is never shake

you are much more than simply dead 
I am a dish for your ashes 
I am a fist for your vanished air

is finding it gone

Old age should burn and rave at close of day; 
Rage, rage against the dying of the light
