Telkom implements harmonised short codes   10:28 CET | News South African operator Telkom has declared that it will implement the new harmonised short codes for customer support on its network, in accordance with ICASA's Number Plan Regulations. From 24 March, Telkom customers will be able to use the new codes to contact customer services, to check voicemail messages and airtime balances, and to reload airtime. 
Telkom will maintain a parallel system, allowing customers to use both the existing numbers and new numbers. Telkom said both sets of codes will run concurrently until the company is confident that customers are familiar with the new ones.
