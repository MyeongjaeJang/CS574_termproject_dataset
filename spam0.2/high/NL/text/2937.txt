Nigeria Liquid Natural Gas (NLNG) has taken delivery of two 130 tonne Grove GMK5130-2 All Terrain cranes. 
The five axle GMK5130-2 has a 60 metre main boom and an 18 metre bi-fold swingaway, plus two straight extension sections, providing a maximum tip height of 92 metres. Both cranes were delivered by Nigerian Grove distributor Savvytech, and are currently being used for the maintenance and construction of gas liquefaction plants on Bonny Island, southern Nigeria. 
Savvytech director Seun Awoniyi said: "NLNG has had a very strong relationship with Manitowoc for many years and has great confidence in its cranes . 
The most reliable cranes in the fleet are 20 year old Grove machines. The return, such as the return on invested capital, was fantastic for the company. Now NLNG has expanded its fleet with two GMK5130-2, which will serve the company just as well. We are convinced of that." SOURCE: Vertikal.net Liked this post?
