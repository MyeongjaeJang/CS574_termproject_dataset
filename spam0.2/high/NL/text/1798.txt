Google launches Launchpad Accelerator in Nigeria   14:29 CET | News 
Google has announced the startups which will participate in the first Google Launchpad Accelerator Africa class. The company also announced a partnership with Udacity and Andela to provide 15,000 single course scholarships and 500 nanodegree scholarships to aspiring and professional developers across Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. Google announced the first Launchpad Accelerator Africa class on 9 November and applications closed on 10 December 2017. 
Launchpad Accelerator Africa is a programme for top early-stage African startups that will operate out of Lagos, Nigeria. Googleâ€™s Launchpad space is its first in Lagos and Facebook plans to launch a hub in Lagos in partnership with Co-Creation Hub this year. Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology, an entrepreneur training programme originally launched in Ghana, has also expanded to Lagos and Cape Town. Over the next three years, the Launchpad Accelerator Africa programme will provide African startups with over USD 3 million in equity-free support, working space, and access to expert advisers from Google, Silicon Valley, and Africa. 
Participants receive travel and PR support during each three-month programme. To qualify, startups have to be a technology startup, based in sub-Saharan Africa, targeting the African market and have already raised seed funding. Google additionally considered the problem the start up is trying to solve, how it creates value for users, and how they addressed a real challenge for their home city, country or Africa broadly.
