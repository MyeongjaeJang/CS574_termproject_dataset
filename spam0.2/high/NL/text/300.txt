0 Solebox Amsterdam is the fourth location and based on a one of a kind concept that was applied to every single detail of the store’s design. The idea was to build an open space that not only pays homage to the city’s creativity but also invites the free minds in Amsterdam to swing by and get not only inspired but also constructive.Solebox’s interpretation of such place is “The Lab”. Place of continuous creation but also evolution and change – natural and technological. The technologies showcased are the most innovative ones in the history of sneakers such as Nike’s Air-System. The Lab“The Lab’s” floor and walls are tiled just like the laboratory tables which serve not only as exhibition places for the exclusive selection of sneakers, but also for glass flasks and microscopes you should take a look through. Just like in the other stores we still blended in our love for sneakers by adapting the looks of elements such as the warning signs on the walls and integrating shoes or soles. With the store we’ve also launched a collaboration with Amsterdam based brand Daily Paper. The look is our own interpretation of laboratory staff coats as oversized long sleeves to represent Solebox’s streetwear selection. Trefwoorden
