Singtel to interconnect m-wallets for cross-border payments Wednesday 21 March 2018 | 07:45 CET | News Singapore mobile operator Singtel has announced plans to interconnect mobile wallets across different ecosystems through an interoperable platform. To start with, the Group plans to initially link the mobile wallets of Singtel and its regional associates, with the first commercial launch between Singtel and AIS. Different mobile wallets across different markets will be connected to offer cross-border payments at physical merchants. 
This initiative is expected to enable the Group's more than 590 million mobile customers to pay with their mobile wallets when they travel in Asia. Other mobile payment apps can, in future, plug into the platform and gain ready access to the Group’s merchant and customer bases across the region. 
The commercial launch of the service is planned for mid-2018 between Singapore and Thailand where Singtel and AIS have obtained regulatory clearance. This will enable over 1.5 million visitors travelling between Singapore and Thailand each year to use Singtel Dash and my AIS apps at a total of more than 20,000 retail merchant acceptance points in Singapore and Thailand. 
Mobile wallet interconnectivity means that travellers can continue to use their existing home wallet app to make payments when overseas. For example, Singtel Dash users travelling to Thailand need only open the Singtel Dash app to generate a QR code at any participating AIS mPAY merchant to scan. Consumers will see the transaction amount in both foreign and home currencies before payment. 
The Group plans to progressively expand this service from the second half of this year to other regional associates, which include Airtel, Globe and Telkomsel, taking into consideration the respective country’s regulations.
