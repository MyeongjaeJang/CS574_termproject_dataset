South Sudan suspends operations of Vivacell, international traffic stops immediately   11:07 CET | News 
South Sudan's National Communication Authority (NCA) has suspended the operations of Vivacell, accusing the telecom company of not complying with the countryâ€™s laws, reports Sudan Tribune. NCA director general Lado Wani Kenyi said the suspension effective 20 March follows a directive from the ICT minister, who gave the operator has one week to suspend all its operations in the country, but international traffic was immediately suspended. 
Sources told the news portal that the decision to suspend Vivacell is linked to its failure to pay taxes and continued use of a licence obtained from Sudan. The government, according to Kenyi, preferred the use of an international gateway policy managed by the information ministry. 
Vivacell, owned by the Lebanon-based Fattouch Investment Group, launched its Gmobilenetwork in February 2009. By early 2011, the company said it had achieved network coverage in all South Sudan's ten state capitals, and along main roads from Juba to Yei and Bor. South Sudan has two other mobile phone operators, MTN and Zain, with reportedly less than 4 million subscribers.
