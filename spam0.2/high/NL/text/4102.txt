Smart boosts LTE-A speeds with 5CC CA, Marikina City tests hit 500 Mbps data rates   10:19 CET | News PLDT’s mobile unit Smart Communications has started activating five-component carrier (5CC) aggregation in Marikina City, boosting the speeds achieved by LTE-A-capable devices to over 500 Mbps. Smart reports that, in a series of daytime tests recently carried out in a densely populated residential area of Marikina City using a Samsung Galaxy S9 smartphone, which is a 5CC-capable device, Smart’s LTE-A network consistently reached data rates of over 500 Mbps, hitting 558 Mbps at one point. 
Smart has deployed 2CC, 3CC, and 4CC in cities across Metro Manila, and in major cities in other regions of the country. Aside from CA, Smart is using two other key features of LTE-A, to deploy it initially in the country’s urban areas where there are predominantly more users of advanced devices, to slowly roll out to the rest of the country. 
Smart uses 4x4 Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) in its network, and 256 QAM. With CA, 4x4 MIMO, and 256 QAM on its network, Smart plans to accelerate its LTE-A rollout.
