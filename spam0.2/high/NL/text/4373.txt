KOCHI: Encouraged by the success of its Nirakoottu unit in Ernakulam, women self help group Kudumbashree Mission has decided to train more women in painting works. 
Sources in Kudumbashree told The Covai Post that the Nirakoottu unit, that was formed two years ago, has managed to paint around 20 apartments and earned a revenue of Rs. 24 lakhs. “Each unit member ears around Rs. 1000 in a day,” sources added. 
“We are receiving orders everyday,” sources said. 
Members of neighbourhood societies in all the districts have been encouraged to set up painting units. A unit has already started functioning in Kottayam, where members are undergoing training. 
The members, sources say, are capable of giving quotations for small buildings. “But we will take the help of professionals when we get order for skyscrapers or big buildings. Once we learn that process we will start giving quotation to any project.” 
Kudumbashree, a women’s empowerment and poverty eradication program floated under State Poverty Eradication Mission by the Kerala Government in 1998 and inaugurated by the former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, aims to tap opportunities in the construction of 2.5 lakh houses to be built under the Life Mission Project. 
The painting units will get loans, subsidies and innovation funds, sources said. 
Kudumbashree is a coordination of three-tier system with the grassroots level group called Neighbourhood Groups (NHG), middle level Area Development Societies (ADS) and the top level Community Development Society (CDS). 
There are over 2.77 lakh NHGs, over 19,854 ADSs and 1,073 CDSs in Kudumbashree. ALSO READ
