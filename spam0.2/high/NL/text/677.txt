Monex: Groeit weerstand binnen ECB tegen Draghi’s dovishness?   
Hieronder volgt een kort commentaar in het Engels van Bart Hordijk, valuta-analist bij Monex Europe op de mogelijk groeiende weerstand in de Governing Council van de ECB tegen Draghi’s dovish beleid. Deze onthulling van “bronnen binnen de ECB” verscheen vandaag via Reuters en zette de EUR/USD koers hoger. 
“ECB sources” revealed to Reuters that the debate among European Central Bank policy makers is now shifting largely from when the Asset Purchasing Program should end to what the steepness of the hiking path after this should be. Additionally the policy makers are comfortable with market forecasts which imply a rate hike by mid2019. 
These “ECB sources” for some have become a synonym for the newest instrument of the European Central Bank Governing Council to communicate its adjustments to forward guidance, hence the reaction by euro as if Mario Draghi himself was on the mic. 
The timing can be seen as peculiar, as Mario Draghi hammered on the “patience” the ECB has with unwinding its APP on a conference last week. If the ECB sources story is not directly orchestrated by Draghi’s fraction in the ECB, it can be an indication that divergence in the Governing Council is growing.This again is particularly interesting as Draghi leaves the helm of the ECB in October 2019 together with four other prime members in the Governing Council who end their term before that. This means a true power shuffle in the ECB is imminent and these leaked stories indicate a more hawkish narrative might then be more leading than now.
