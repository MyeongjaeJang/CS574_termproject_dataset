Taking place from 26 to 29 September this year, the continuous updates to the annual Monaco Yacht Show will be more visible this year than ever, with the restructuring of Quai des Etats-Unis changing the layout and flow of traffic for visitors and exhibitors.

Essentially, the extension of the T central dock has now been removed to make space for an entirely new quay on the northern part of the show. “ The organisers of the MYS will take advantage of the restructuring of Quai des Etats-Unis in Port Hercules by the Principality of Monaco to improve the visit experience of the show’s private clientele by giving priority to the presence of yacht designers, builders and brokerage houses in front of their superyachts on display for sale or charter ,” comments the event committee.

This year will see some 40 superyachts make their international debuts during the event that has become one of the most important events on the global superyacht calendar. 
As media partner of the 2018 Monaco Yacht Show, SuperYacht Times will be attending the event in full force to bring all the latest news and the best scenes from Monaco. Advertisement
