Toshiba launches data centre SSD line-up with 64-layer 3D flash memory   06:24 CET | News 
Toshiba Memory has introduced its latest line-up of NVM Express (NVMe) and SATA data centre solid-state drives (SSDs) in multiple form factors. The new SSDs are designed to offer cloud data centers reliability, as well as deliver lower operating power for read-intensive applications such as NoSQL databases, big data analytics and streaming media. Samples of the CD5 Series and XD5 Series of NVMe SSDs and the HK6-DC Series of SATA SSDs will be available to limited customers in the second quarter of this year. 
The new SSDs use Toshibaâ€™s 64-layer 3-bit-per-cell TLC (triple-level cell) BiCS FLASH 3D flash memory. In combination with controllers designed and developed in-house, the new SSDs deliver comprehensive customer support. 
The two PCIe NVMe SSDs are designed to accommodate multiple data center workload profiles. The CD5 Series supports capacities ranging from 960GB to 7.68TB in a 2.5-inch form factor, and delivers up to 500,000 IOPS random read, up to 35,000 IOPS random write, up to 3,140MB/s sequential read, and up to 1,980MB/s sequential write performance within a 9-14W power envelope. The XD5 Series is a small-footprint M.2 22110 form factor SSD that supports capacities up to 3.84TB and delivers up to 2,600 Mbps sequential read and up to 890Mbps sequential write performance in a 7W power envelope. 
The HK6-DC Series is a 6Gbps SATA SSD and is available in 960GB, 1.92TB and 3.84TB capacities. It delivers a performance of up to 85,000IOPS random read and 16,000IOPS random write, and up to 550 Mbps sequential read and 500Mbps sequential write. The new data center SSDs also feature power loss protection and cryptographic erase support for secure data erasure.
