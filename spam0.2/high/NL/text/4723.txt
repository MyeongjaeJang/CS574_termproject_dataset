Zyxel unveils new SoHo gigabit switches   10:30 CET | News Zyxel Communications announced new additions of SOHO Web Managed PoE Gigabit Switch, the GS1200-5HP/8HP v2 series. For SOHO offices looking to connect WiFi access points, IP cameras, laptops or a wide range of connected devices to the internet, the GS1200-5HP/8HP v2 PoE switches save users from the cable mess by supplying power and data through one cable instead of two. Users will be able to get past installation limits and place connected devices anywhere they like, even where there is no power socket available. The 60W total PoE budget provides sufficient power to accommodate even the latest WiFi APs or cameras commonly used in SOHO offices. 
The switches are compatible with multicast IGMP snooping v1/v2 and v3 to intelligently forward traffic to devices groups without slowing down the entire network. When multiple devices are connected, the QoS (Quality of Service) feature of the switches will prioritise traffic for applications that need it the most.
