Out of Steam? Federer Loses to World No 175, drops from World Number 1 By 0 Credit: Getty Images R oger Federer suffered his earliest defeat at the Miami Open since 2000 and will lose his world No 1 ranking after a second-round defeat to Australian world No 175 Thanasi Kokkinakis. 
Six days after losing a final set tie-break to Juan Martin del Potro, Federer suffered the same fate again as 21-year-old Kokkinakis recorded the biggest win of his career, coming from a set down to win 3-6 6-3 7-6 in Florida. 
Defeat for defending champion Federer, just his second of the season, means the legendary Swiss will lose his place at the top of the world rankings to Rafael Nadal when the updated list is confirmed next Monday having reclaimed it with his title victory in Rotterdam in February.
