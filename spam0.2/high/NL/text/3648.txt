Important news for the heavy lifting sector Another "InHouse" Seminar Completed 
24 March 2018 
This past week, Richard Krabbendam presented his 3 Day Seminar "Heavy Transport, Lifting, Shipping, Offshore & Wind Turbine Installation Techniques" for a group of 30 engineers and operational staff of the Belgium Dredging contractor "Jan de Nul" . 
As Jan de Nul, owner of the Wind Turbine Installation Jack-up vessel "Vol Au Vent" since 4 years became quite active as EPC contractor for Wind farms, the management decided to train and educate their staff the "Basic principles of How to Handle Heavy Loads Safely" 
It was a very receptive group, eager to learn and did well at the end of the 3 days in the final evaluation test. There are still two opportunities to join Richard's extensive 4 day Seminar. Form 9-12 April 2018, he will be presenting his well known Seminar in Kuala Lumpur and finally his last public Seminar from 1 4-17 May 2018 in Aberdeen.
