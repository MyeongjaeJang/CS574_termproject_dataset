IEEE publishes IEEE 802.3cc-2017 25 Gbps Ethernet standard   18:52 CET | News IEEE and the IEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA) announced the publishing and availability of 'IEEE 802.3cc-2017â€”Standard for Ethernet amendment: physical layer and management parameters for serial 25 Gbps Ethernet operation over single-mode fibre.' The new amendment to IEEE 802.3 represents the first available industry standard developed specifically to address the growing need for increased Ethernet speeds for enterprise, campus and metro Ethernet speeds exceeding 10 Gbps, and that can support reaches up to 10 and 40 kilometers over single-mode fiber (SMF). 
IEEE 802.3cc supports efficient Ethernet operation and defines single-lane 25 Gbps PHYs for operation over single-mode fibre with lengths up to 10 km and 40 km. IEEE 802.3cc addresses the requirement in metropolitan networks, where the core operates at 100 Gbps, for tributary feeds at rates higher than 10 Gbps. By enabling extended 25 Gbps reaches, IEEE 802.3cc matches the per-lane rate of several 100 Gbps PMDs currently used in these networks. IEEE 802.3cc is available for purchase at the IEEE Standards Store. Free Headlines in your E-mail
