Ficora grants licence for satellite to watch space weather and aurora borealis   14:05 CET | News 
Finnish communications regulator Ficora said it has granted a radio licence for the Suomi 100 satellite system created by Aalto University. It comprises one satellite and two earth stations, one in Espoo and the other on Svalbard in Norway. Uses include researching electromagnetic phenomena in near-earth space (space weather) and capturing images of space landscape such as the northern lights (aurora borealis). 
The satellite will orbit the Earth at an altitude of around 700 kilometres. One orbital period takes around 1 hour and 38 minutes. The Suomi 100 is classed as a nanosatellite, because it only weighs around 1 kilogramme, but it has all the normal components of a bigger satellite.
