Digital pay-TV subscriptions exceed 1 bln in 2017   14:34 CET | News 
Digital pay-TV subscriptions, including cable, satellite and IPTV, exceeded 1 billion for the first time in 2017, according to data from IHS. Digital pay-TV growth came largely from the Asia-Pacific region and the number of subscriptions increased in all regions but dropped in North America. The global growth comes despite the continued uptake of over-the-top (OTT) subscription video services, like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video, which attracted more than three times the number of subscriptions than pay-TV in 2017. 
Digital pay-TV subscriptions in the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 83 percent of net additions, mainly driven by IPTV growth in China. However, led by an increase in smartphone penetration and improvements in mobile data accessibility and affordability, there were three new OTT subscriptions for every new pay-TV subscription in 2017 in the region. In comparison, Western Europe added eight OTT subscriptions for every pay-TV net addition, while in Central and Eastern Europe the number of OTT and pay- TV net additions were equal. 
While OTT penetration remains low in the Middle East and Africa, the region will grow rapidly in the coming years, as both international and local players leverage their original content and partner with local pay-TV operators and telcos. Unlike other regions, digital pay-TV subscriptions in North America continued to decline, losing 3 million homes in 2017, while OTT subscriptions increased by nearly 30 million.
