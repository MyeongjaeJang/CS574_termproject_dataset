Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills is pleased to announce that Vanessa Williams, the hotel's director of sales and marketing, has been honored in the March issue of Los Angeles Confidential Magazine as one of nine key "Women of Influence" in Southern California. 
Williams, whose hospitality career spans nearly 30 years and encompasses worldwide destinations (including the Waldorf Astoria Beijing), told the magazine that one of her strengths lies in making sure her team has the freedom to think for themselves. "It is most important that my team trust my suggestions, but I also want them to embrace their own way of doing things, because strong individuals make exceptional hotels." 
In the ten months that the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills has been open at the iconic corner of Wilshire and Santa Monica boulevards, Williams has been a key part of why the hotel has quickly established itself as one of the premier luxury hotels in Southern California, as well as the go-to place for local residents. Locals are flocking to enjoy a glass of bubbly and more at the popular Rooftop by JG bar (and casual restaurant that serves lunch and dinner), which offers lovely views of Los Angeles from every comfortable seat, and at the hotel's signature restaurant, Jean-Georges Beverly Hills, the first West Coast venture by globally-acclaimed chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten.
