Wire Service Telefónica creates a suite of Big Data products for enterprises in partnership with Huawei  The Big-Data-as-a-Service products will be marketed under the brand of LUCA, Telefónicas data unit Madrid – WEBWIRE – Wednesday, March 21, 2018 
Telefónica and Huawei have announced a partnership to launch a set of Big Data products aimed at enterprises that want to develop their own internal use cases as well as to sell data applications to their clients. 
These Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) products will be marketed under the brand of LUCA , Telefónicas data unit. Initially, the agreement provides customers four core services: Hortonworks Data Platform as a service to help store, process and analyze data; Big Data Integration to migrate data to the cloud; Data Governance to control the quality and security of data; and Data Miner to help create insights from data through analytical algorithms and complex structured and unstructured data integration. Each of the services can be self-deployed for use by the customer on-demand. They are infrastructure agnostic meaning they can be deployed over a variety of Infrastructure-as-a-Service environments. 
In the first phase of deployment, Telefónica and Huawei will focus on providing these services over Telefónicas cloud infrastructure in Latin America. Customers will benefit from Telefónicas proximity as a single provider as well as the quality and security of its infrastructures. 
This method of providing services on-demand helps customers avoid long hardware procurement cycles and large investments as well as reduce the time-to-market. 
Huawei has gone through a journey of transformation and along the way has accumulated valuable technological expertise in the domains of cloud, big data and AI. It has been instrumental in the creation of Big Data platforms in many telco operators both in China and overseas.
