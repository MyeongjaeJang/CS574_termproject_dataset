Argentina readying new 4G spectrum tender - report   09:24 CET | News 
Argentina is looking to raise as much as USD 800 million via an auction of 90MHz of 4G spectrum to be held later this year, according to an unnamed government source cited by Reuters. The tender is expected to consist of 60MHz that local operator Arlink received in an auction for spectrum in the 700MHz band held in 2015 that was later returned, plus 30MHz held by state operator Arsat. 
Telecom Argentina, Telefonica (Movistar) and America Movil (Claro) have all expressed an interest in the auction and are preparing their strategies, said the report, adding that it could take place around mid-year, either through a law or a presidential decree. Communications regulator Enacom required Telecom Argentina to divest 80Mhz of spectrum to the state as part of its recent merger with Cablevision, but the report says the government is planning to raise the 140MHz spectrum limit for a single operator so that it can take part in the auction.
