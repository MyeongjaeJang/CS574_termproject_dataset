Share on: google + Another big move in the transfer world has been announced after it was confirmed that OFF-WHITE’s Virgil Abloh will be joining Louis Vuitton as their new menswear designer. The news comes after last week, LV’s former designer, Kim Jones joined Dior, pathing the way for this rumoured move to happen. Abloh, who has achieved such a high status within the fashion industry thanks to his work with OFF-WHITE and the various collaborations he’s curated – the most recent and most famous being the one with Nike. Funnily enough, Kim Jones actually posted a pair of Nike x OFF-WHITE Air Jordans on his Instagram last week, thanking Virgil personally. A possible hint at what was to happen? Abloh, now one of the very few black designers operating at the very top level of fashion, has spoken out already on what is a huge moment for global fashion. “I feel elated. This opportunity to think through what the next chapter of design and luxury will mean at a brand that represents the pinnacle of luxury was always a goal in my wildest dreams. And to show a younger generation that there is no one way anyone in this kind of position has to look is a fantastically modern spirit in which to start.” We at LAF are eager to see him get started and we can all expect to see his first collection debuted at Paris Fashion Week.
