The movement has particular velocity due to its placement in the wake of the Russian hacking and advertising scandals ; and as I’m writing this, the #DeleteFacebook movement is trending globally and Facebook’s stock price has been hit hard. 
It seems like maybe this time, consumers are mad enough about data privacy to make some change happen. 
Here’s why I’m doubtful that it will stick. Understanding Facebook’s moat 
#DeleteUber had a meaningful impact on Uber’s business, but it’s unlikely that Facebook will feel the same pain over the long-term. Why? Facebook has built their product moat too deep for a mass-exodus. 
Uber is just a ride-hailing app. 
Sure, they’ve given you a way to order over-priced food delivery. But, that’s a pure novelty that isn’t going to keep anyone around. 
Facebook is far more embedded in our daily lives. Facebook owns your social network. 
For many people, Facebook’s network effect is the most compelling reason to stick around, it’s the greatest community in the world that connects us to news, friends, groups, local happenings, and job postings. 
Facebook has reunited mothers with their lost children. 
Hundreds of us use Facebook to stay informed on what we care about most, the connections around us. 
650 million people have used Facebook to plan events  — because it is the undisputed best way to do so. 
Facebook has also cemented itself as a source of news. Today, 48% of people go straight to Facebook for news, only 41% head directly to a publisher’s website. 
So when you #DeleteFacebook, you’re not just giving up access to friends and relatives. You’re giving up access to local happenings and global news. 
Facebook has completely transformed the way we live our lives. Facebook has become your favorite password. 
Another core tenant to Facebook’s success is their product moat using authorization into other apps. Millions of people use Facebook to login to fitness apps, online stores, communities, and membership accounts. 
61% of social logins are done using Facebook. 
When you’re asked to re-create dozens of accounts in a days-time, you’re probably going to consider going back to the platform. Facebook has become such a convenient utility to have all of your data pre-filled, in one place, and a login just one-click away. 220 million people would need to delete Facebook to make a 1% dent in their global user base. 
Even as large as the backlash against Facebook has grown, it’s relative drop in the bucket. Sure, Facebook should be concerned about such a massive uprising, but the overwhelming majority of its users likely haven’t even seen the backlash, and even if they have, they probably couldn’t care less. 
The United States isn’t Facebook’s only user base, nor its biggest. As a group, we’re understandably upset and frustrated about how Facebook treated our data. However, Facebook’s global reach is much bigger than a twitter trend. Even if you #DeleteFacebook, you’re still using Facebook products. 
If you delete your Facebook account, it’s undoubtable that the hours you’re saving will go towards apps like Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and maybe even your Oculus headset…oh right, those are all owned by Facebook too. 
Statista reports Instagram has skyrocketed to 800 million monthly active users . WhatsApp has soared to 1.5 billion , with a strong global presence. Messenger boasts 1.3 billion more monthlies. And finally, VR Headsets have topped 1 million shipments quarterly, with 21% of them provided by Facebook-owned Oculus . 
That is a downright incredible offering. 
And, each of these platforms become easier to use and more powerful with a connected Facebook account — that’s no coincidence. If your argument for leaving Facebook is that you do not wish to power their data-machine with insights, you need to prepare yourself to not just leave a social network — you need to leave an entire ecosystem of products.

The world right now: Facebook is evil. Also, the world right now: logging into Facebook and Facebook-owned properties: Instagram, Whatsapp.

In the wake of #DeleteUber we all felt pretty powerful. Thousands of people left the platform (for Lyft), many never looked back. Uber’s moat was just a muddy little stream. 
But Facebook is different. 
It’s clearly time for Facebook to take action here. Their recent statements will help settle the nerves of users. And, it’s a good thing that they’ve finally acknowledged the problem. But, it’s time to start setting strong guidelines for the future and, most importantly, acting on them. 
I hope they do the right thing, because I am doubtful that any of us have the willpower to stay away from Facebook or their properties for any meaningful amount of time.
