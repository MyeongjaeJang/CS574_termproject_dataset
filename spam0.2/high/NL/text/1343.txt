One-Owner 1957 BMW 507 Roadster 
John Surtees is a racing legend, having won multiple motorcycle World Championships and claiming the F1 driver's title for Ferrari in 1964. Fresh off winning the 500cc title with MV Agusta in 1956, Surtees noticed a BMW 507 roadster at Germany's Hockenheim circuit undergoing testing. Surtees was smitten and purchased one for himself, going half in with Count Agusta to buy the car. For the next 60 years, the car was driven regularly by Surtees, remaining in his possession until his death in March of 2017. Offered for auction by his estate, this one-owner 507 has provenance to spare. Paul McCartney's Lamborghini 400 GT 
Powered by a 4.0L V12, the 400 GT 2+2 was immediately welcomed into the ranks of the world's best Grand Tourers — and into the garage of Sir Paul McCartney. Delivered during the height of The Beatles' popularity with seating for every member of the Fab Four, the car stayed in Macca's possession until 1979 when it was sold to a well-known collector. The collector ended up purchasing the car twice, selling it in 1989 only to buy it back in 1996, with a rear suspension and gearbox rebuild the only changes in that time. It has been stored in a climate-controlled environment since 2011, and outside of its wine red livery — a change made long ago — remains in highly original condition.
