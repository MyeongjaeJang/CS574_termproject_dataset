Happy Hump Day! 
We are on the lookout for the hottest Bombshells and Bombers, as we gear up for Conversations with Claire DMV on Sunday, March 25th! Make sure to purchase a ticket before they’re sold out! 
Today’s Bombshell of the Day is this sultry goddess named Halle aka @halledeneen, who is from Baltimore. 
She writes, “My style is very fun, chic, and edgy! I love to give different looks depending on my mood for the day. My style is full of unexpected elements.” 
“Each day, I seek to project self-love through my outfit choices. The most important thing when getting dressed is to look and feel confident.” 

HOT! So sleek and classy!
