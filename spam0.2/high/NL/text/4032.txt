FCC to block universal service funds to Huawei, ZTE customers - report Monday 26 March 2018 | 08:35 CET | News 
The US Federal Communications Commission is considering a new rule to further curb the US business of Huawei Technologies and ZTE, making it harder for small and rural carriers to purchase equipment from the Chinese companies, people familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. Carriers drawing from the Universal Service Fund would not be allowed to use Huawei or ZTE gear. 
The fund is worth USD 8 billion a year in subsidies for bringing phone and broadband service to rural America and low-income households. Operators would be ineligible for the funding if they took Huawei or ZTE equipment. 
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai recently told members of Congress that he intends "to take proactive steps to help ensure the integrity of the communications supply chain in the United States in the near future". The FCC proposal took shape after lawmakers sent Pai a letter in December, asking that he and his fellow commissioners start receiving intelligence-agency briefings about the threat Huawei and other Chinese telecom-equipment companies pose, a person familiar with the matter told the WSJ. 
The December letter also asked the FCC to scrutinize a pending deal by AT&T to sell Huawei smartphones . AT&T dropped that deal in January, without explaining why.
