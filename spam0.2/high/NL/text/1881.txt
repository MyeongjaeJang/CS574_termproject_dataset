Over 1,800 start-ups benefit from German govt support since 2007  39 CET | News 
Over 1,800 start-ups in Germany have received financial assistance from the country’s Federal Ministry for Economics (BMWi) in the form of an Exist Founding Stipend since the initiative was launched in 2007, according to research from German digital association Bitkom. The BMWi thus granted support to over half of the roughly 3,300 applications for assistance, making Exist an “important component” of startup financing in Germany, they added. 
Startup founders in Bavaria received the most stipends (358 awards), followed by Berlin (292), North Rhine-Westphalia (266) and Baden-Wuerttemberg (201). Bitkom called on the German government to uphold its promise in the coalition agreement to continue its support for the Exist program over the next few years.
