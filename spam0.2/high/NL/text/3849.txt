The Weeknd is getting the special treatment over at Marvel with his very own comic, “The Weeknd Presents: Starboy.” 
On Thursday, Marvel revealed the release date for their collaboration with the singer, as well as the synopsis of the comic. 
The Weeknd said, “Marvel is the pinnacle of success in their field and I’ve been a lifelong fan of their work. To be able to partner with them is a dream come true.” 
He helped write the comic alongside La Mar Taylor and Christos Gage. While Eric Nguyen and Guru-eFX created the cover. 
According to the comic’s synopsis: 
“The city of Alphatron is in the grip of a crime wave, as the terrifying Jack “The Chef” Smiley has unified all criminal organizations with his ruthlessness and strategic genius. Not content with brutally murdering his victims, Smiley also feasts upon their flesh. The citizens live in fear and the police have been directly targeted. The city is in dire need of a hero. It will not get one, but it will get what it deserves: Starboy!” 
The title of the comic is, of course, developed from The Weeknd’s 2016 album “Starboy.”
