Share on: google + He’s one of the youngest in the game but that doesn’t mean he can’t be one of the most swaggy. 19-year-old Kylian Mbappe had to be featured as LAF LOOK after stepping out in this outfit during the international break. And there’s only one place to start… from the bottom. From the sneakers. From those NIKE x OFF WHITE Air Jordan 1s. Super rare sneakers, these have been catching the attention of many a Hypebeast since Virgil Abloh dropped them and it seems as though Kylian copped them. Pairing them with some smart Prada trousers, almost understated in comparison, he’s made the coveted shoes the main part of the outfit – and there’s little wrong with that. APC trench coat completes his look, keeping the weather out whilst still looking stylish as we all await Spring to save us from these random snow storms. Mbappe looks the most prepared for SS18, though.
