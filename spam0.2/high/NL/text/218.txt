Ofcom publishes guide for mobile spectrum auction   11:11 CET | News 
UK regulator Ofcom has published a guide on how the upcoming mobile spectrum auction will work. The auction will start on 20 March, with Ofcom releasing spectrum in the 2.3 and 3.4 GHz bands. 
The auction will take place over a number of rounds, with bidders confirming the 'lots' of available spectrum they want to buy at a price set by the regulator. This price will increase round-by-round until there are no new bids. The reserve price for each 2.3 GHz lot is GBP 10 million (with four lots of 10 MHz each available), and the reserve price for reach 3.4 GHz lot is GBP 1 million (30 lots of 5 MHz each). A second stage of the auction will then determine in the band the spectrum purchased by bidders will be located. 
Ofcom said that spectrum auctions can take several weeks. At the end of each during the principal first stage, Ofcom will publish the prices for the 2.3 and 3.4 GHz lots in the last round of that day; and a measure of demand in each band in relation to the last round of the day. Full details of the spectrum secured by bidders will be published once the auction is complete. Free Headlines in your E-mail
