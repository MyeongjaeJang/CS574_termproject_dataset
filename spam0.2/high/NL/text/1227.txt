German VHF transmissions risk April shutdown in fee dispute  35 CET | News 
Numerous VHF transmitters across Germany could be shut down for a time beginning 01 April as a result of a dispute between antenna and transmission network operators over price increases for VHF transmissions, reported TelTarif. The new owners of antennas purchased from Media Broadcast last year are raising prices for VHF transmissions by 25 to 30 percent, but network operators responsible for the signal feeds to the antennas are balking at the price hikes, wrote TelTarif. 
As a result, antenna operators are threatening to switch off their VHF signal transmissions and thus radio stations from 01 April when the new antenna operators take ownership of their equipment. The dispute affects public service broadcasters as well as private radio networks in Germany. 
Germany’s State Media Authorities organized a round table discussion in mid-March involving antenna investors, site owners (DFMG), transmission network operators, representatives from public and private radio stations and other German regulators to address the issue of VHF transmissions. But participants only agreed to continue broadcasting VHF transmissions through 31 March to allow more time for negotiations, wrote TelTarif. 
Still, an association of commercial broadcasters (APR) said it was unsatisfied with the result of the round table and noted that an 01 April shutdown was still a possibility given that several “important antenna operators” did not attend the meeting, according to the report.
