CDU General Secretary hails govt decision to embrace fibre Monday 26 March 2018 | 15:58 CET | News German lawmakers’ shift in focus away from vectoring to nationwide fibre coverage in the recent coalition agreement is a “trend-setting decision” that will enable Germany to develop new business models and products, said Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the secretary general of Germany’s conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), in her keynote address at the 20th anniversary party for German telecoms association VATM. 
Kramp-Karrenbauer likewise said in her talk that it's important Germany becomes a “leading market” for the new 5G mobile standard. Here she stressed that questions of how Germany would organize the new standard in terms of frequency auctions and coverage requirements were essential, while it is also imperative that regulators and businesses ensure citizens accept and see an added value resulting from the new standard.
