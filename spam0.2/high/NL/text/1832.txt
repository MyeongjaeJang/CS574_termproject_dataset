International engineering company PD&MS Group has secured a trio of contracts worth more than £10 million ($14 million) across three major North Sea late life projects in the last six months. 
The latest award for the Aberdeen-headquartered company is a multimillion-pound contract from Spirit Energy to decommission the topsides on two of its unmanned Morecambe Bay gas field drilling platforms in the East Irish Sea. 
The company added it was currently supporting similar decommissioning projects of North Sea installations for two major operators through offshore heavy lift contractor Allseas. 
The two-year campaign for Spirit Energy will see the PD&MS team being responsible for decommissioning and operations on the DP3 and DP4 unmanned installations as they move into the end-of-life phase. 
The firm will also assist with the provision of independent intervention teams comprising operations and management personnel to support offshore visits during the preparation and construction phases. 
In addition, PD&MS will manage the pipeline cleaning scope and interface with the wells plugging and abandonment and heavy lift contractors appointed by Spirit Energy. 25 new jobs 
The company said that around ten new onshore positions at PD&MS and 15 offshore roles would be created to support the specialist provider of engineering, procurement and construction services for the global oil and gas industry during the project. 
PD&MS CEO, Simon Rio , said: “We have secured over £10 million in decommissioning projects in the past six months, and this most recent contract win sees PD&MS delivering on three significant North Sea decommissioning projects at the same time.” Share this article
