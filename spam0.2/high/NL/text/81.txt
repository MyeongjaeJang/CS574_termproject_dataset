RIO Gold medal winner and new Matchroom signing wants Moylette revenge By irishboxing   Headline News 
Daniyar Yeleussinov doesn’t feel he should have a defeat to avenge, but is keen to get Ray Moylette revenge nonetheless. 
The Kazakh welterweight grabbed the boxing headlines last week as it was revealed he would ditch the vest, turn pro with Matchroom and debut on the same card as another former amateur great Katie Taylor in New York on April 28th. 
That New York night will be step one on the road to Pound to Pound greatness for the Rio 2016 Olympic gold medal winner according to manager Ziya Aliyev. Widgets Magazine 
However, a fight with the Pascal Collins trained Moylette, who makes his TV debut against Matt Doherty in Boston on March 31, is a fight he wants along that journey. 
The Mayo favourite defeated the new Matchroom fight to claim Ireland’s first ever World Youth gold back at the 2008 Championships in Guadalajara, Mexico and while Yeleussinov deosn’t believe Moylette, who described the win as smash and grab wasn’t deserved, was deserving of the win he does want revenge. 
Speaking to Irish-boxing.com his manager Ziya Aliyev confirmed 
“Well first of all he doesn’t think he lost that fight in amateurs with all respect to Ray. Someday they will meet when Ray makes it up to welterweight.” 
Moylette, who is now campainging at lightweight, has been open about how talented his former foe is and has backed him to go all the way, but did express a desire to rematch in the pros. 
The new pro’s manager believes if they were to renew acquaintances there would only be one winner. 
“I think Daniyar would win that fight. He was one of the most dangerous welterweights in the amateurs now he is coming to take that place in pros. I am sure that Daniyar will be champion of the world , he will go far and will be P4P definitely.That is why we chose Eddie Hearn Matchroom Boxing.
