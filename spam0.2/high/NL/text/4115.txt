Sarana Menara to acquire Komet Infra Nusantara for IDR 1.4 trillion  13 CET | News 
Indonesian telecom infrastructure provider Sarana Menara Nusantara (SMN), the parent company of Protelindo, announced that Protelindo signed definitive agreements with several selling parties to acquire Komet Infra Nusantara (KIN), an independent telecommunications tower provider in Indonesia. The agreed price for up to 100 percent ownership of the shares is approximately IDR 1.4 trillion, subject to adjustments. Funding for this transaction is planned to be through a combination of internal cash and debt. 
KIN owns approximately 1,400 telecommunication towers with over 2,000 lease tenants. SMN believes that both KIN’s tower locations and tenant mix are highly complementary to Protelindo's existing portfolio. SMN expects the acquisition to close within the next six weeks. During this period, SMN plans to finalize documentation and prepare to integrate Protelindo’s and KIN’s operations to minimize operational disruptions to the combined entity’s customers.
