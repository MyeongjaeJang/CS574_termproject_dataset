Russian national operator Rostelecom will launch its broadband services in five villages in the Republic of North Ossetia by October. Works will be carried out under the framework of the federal programme on elimination of the digital divide, and 100 km of fibre-optic lines will be built for the project. Broadband at up to 210 Mbps will become available over Wi-Fi hot-spots deployed in the villages. 
In 2017, Rostelecom deployed its GPON network in the settlements of Verkhnyaya-Simba and Nizhnyaya-Simba in the region, after building 17 km of fibre lines.
