23 March 2018, 21:20 Yerevan: rally participants demand to seize power from Sargsyan 
Armen Ovannisyan, an activist of the front named "For the Sake of State of Armenia", speaking to a rally held in Yerevan, called to fight for the removal of Serzh Sargsyan, who is intending to assume the post of prime minister, from power. The rally was about 150 people strong. 
According to the participants of the rally, their aim is to stop any further Sargsyan's presence at power, the "Caucasian Knot" correspondent reports. 
Earlier, Mr Sargsyan stated that he was not going to become prime minister, but did not rule out that after the end of his presidential term, the ruling Republican Party would nominate him for this post. 
Authorities are assuring us that "any protest against them is doomed to failure," but the opposition has the will to achieve its goals and take real action, Mr Ovannisyan has stated. 
Also, the protesters supported the demand to release political prisoners, including Zhirair Sefilyan, the leader of the movement "100 years without regime", who was sentenced on March 20.
