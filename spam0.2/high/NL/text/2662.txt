Chelsea fans are pretty excited about the club having reportedly tabling an offer of £55m for Inter Milan striker Mauro Icardi in the last 24 hours. 
The Blues have already brought in two new strikers this season, with Alvaro Morata coming in for a club-record fee in the summer and Olivier Giroud joining the club from Arsenal in January. 
Antonio Conte also has Tammy Abraham and Michy Batshuayi both out on loan, but reports suggest that the club are looking to bring in another forward this summer, meaning that there could be some tough choices for those already there. 
Icardi has been in superb form once again this season for Inter Milan, netting 22 goals in 24 Serie A matches, with the 25-year-old second in the top scorers list for the Italian league. 
He has been one of the highest scorers in European football in the past couple of seasons and could be interested in making a move to the Premier League. 
And for Chelsea fans, the links with the Argentine have got some on social media pretty excited about the prospect and the goals he could bring. Fuhhh Chelsea bids Icardi😍😍😍

— Robert Michaels RIBA (@ukarchitect) March 22, 2018 Been hearing all the rumours about Icardi to Chelsea. €63 million wouldn’t be enough but it’s a start. Would love him at Chelsea. Finally showing some more ambition 💙 pic.twitter.com/YMce7nVK0a
