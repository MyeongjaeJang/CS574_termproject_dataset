Turkey tightens grip on media with new bill on online TV content Friday 23 March 2018 | 11:35 CET | News Turkeyâ€™s parliament tightened its grip over the country's media by approving a bill granting the radio and television watchdog authority RTUK the right to regulate online content, writes news agency Reuters. Broadcasters wishing to stream content online now need to be licensed by the RTUK watchdog. The move will not allow Turkish broadcasters to avoid censorship and strict regulations by moving to online streaming platforms. It raises another question mark over the intentions of the country's authorities as these have been harshly criticised by right groups and Western Allies for increasing media restrictions after the 2016 failed coup against President Tayyip Erdogan.
