Legg Mason: Comment on US trade tariffs   
By Kim Catechis, Head of Global Emerging Markets at the Legg Mason affiliate Martin Currie 
The threats of $60bn further tariffs is not unexpected, the Chinese are on to it and are ready - they have a long list of proportional tariffs prepared to fight back with. 
Trade war could be to emerging markets’ advantage 
US tariffs on steel and aluminium imports have now gone live (although some two thirds of imports are exempted) and US President Donald Trump has announced plans for charges on up to US$60 billion of Chinese products, sparking concerns of a trade war. 
China’s modest response has been to target mainly agricultural goods (a sensitive sector for US exports) and there are further measures waiting in the wings in the event of any further escalation. 
Beijing has already dug in for the long haul and is unlikely to back down, accelerating diversification of markets via its Belt & Road project and other initiatives. The perceived wisdom is that Trump has left room to concede and China has targeted an increase in oil and soy imports, as a way to offer a face-saving de-escalation. 
While these headlines may have caused alarm among investors in emerging markets, in the longer term, these trade restrictions will only serve to accelerate the rapid growth of intra-regional trade among emerging markets, to the exclusion of the US. In our view, this will further shift the gravitational axis of world trade in emerging markets’ favour.
