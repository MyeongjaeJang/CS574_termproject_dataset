MTN Ghana raises IPO target to GHC 3.48 bln   09:25 CET | News 
MTN Ghana has lifted its target for its initial public offering (IPO) by more than a half to GHC 3.48 billion, according to Bloomberg. MTN is preparing to list a 35 percent stake in its Ghanaian business on the local stock exchange, valuing the unit at about USD 2.2 billion. The bourse had estimated the value of the stake at about GHC 2 billion in February but this has been raised after a new valuation of the company, said sources who asked not to be identified because they are not authorised to speak publicly about the matter. 
The sale is likely to start in April, even though the Securities and Exchange Commission still needs to approve the listingâ€™s prospectus, said the sources. There was no immediate response from MTN, said Bloomberg. If successful, the share sale will exceed by more than ten times the Ghana Stock Exchange's previous biggest IPO, when Agricultural Development Bank raised GHC 326 million in December 2016. MTN is listing the stake to meet conditions agreed to in 2015, when it acquired the right to use spectrum that can carry mobile data for customers.
