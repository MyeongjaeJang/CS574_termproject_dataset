Fake Facebook news fools thousands into thinking ‘deaf’ MP was sleeping in parliament Published time: 22 Mar, 2018 16:05 Edited time: 23 Mar, 2018 08:06 Get short URL © imago stock&people / Global Look Press Thousands of people online accused a deaf Tory MP of being “lazy” after pictures re-emerged of him apparently sleeping during a Commons session.
