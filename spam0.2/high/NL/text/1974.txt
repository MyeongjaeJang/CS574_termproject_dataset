Performance 21 March 2018 STR: U.S. hotel performance for February 2018 
HENDERSONVILLE, Tennessee â€“ The U.S. hotel industry reported positive results in the three key performance metrics during February 2018, according to data from STR . 
In a year-over-year comparison with February 2017, the industry posted the following: Occupancy: +1.2% to 61.7% Average daily rate (ADR): +2.3% to US$126.38 Revenue per available room (RevPAR): +3.5% to US$78.02 
"RevPAR has now increased year over year for 96 consecutive months, or eight years in a row," said Jan Freitag, STR's senior VP of lodging insights. "That is far longer than the upswing after 9/11 (56 months), but not yet as long as the positive RevPAR run in the mid-90s (112 months). RevPAR growth for February 2018 specifically was a bit stronger than expected, driven by both healthy occupancy and ADR gains. ADR has now risen at or above 2.3% in four of the last five months." 
Among the Top 25 Markets, Super Bowl LII host Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota , experienced the only double-digit rise in occupancy (+13.0% to 64.6%) and the largest increases in ADR (+47.0% to US$158.26) and RevPAR (+66.0% to US$102.29). 
Miami/Hialeah, Florida , posted the only other double-digit lift in ADR (+12.1% to US$260.17), which drove the month's second-highest rise in RevPAR (+17.2% to US$226.19). 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-New Jersey , reported the second-largest increase in occupancy (+8.1% to 63.1%), resulting in the third-largest jump in RevPAR (+12.2% to US$75.87). 
Overall, 18 of the Top 25 Markets reported RevPAR growth. 
San Francisco/San Mateo, California, reported the steepest decline in RevPAR (-15.9% to US$160.40), due primarily to the second-largest decreases in occupancy (-5.6% to 76.6%) and ADR (-10.9% to US$209.31). 
Houston, Texas, last year's Super Bowl host, reported the largest decrease in ADR (-17.9% to US$112.39), resulting in the second-largest drop in RevPAR (-14.0% to US$79.14). 
Seattle, Washington , experienced the largest drop in occupancy (-7.5% to 67.6%). 
"We saw the obvious Super Bowl performance spike in Minneapolis as well as the negative year-over-year comparison for Houston one year removed from its Super Bowl host year," Freitag said. "At the same time, we saw further weakening of the post-hurricane impact in Texas, which is to be expected as FEMA spending in the state continues to decrease. Overall, RevPAR growth was the same (+3.4%) in the major markets as it was in all other markets. Growth in the non-Top 25 Markets was more driven by ADR gains."
