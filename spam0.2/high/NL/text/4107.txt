Oracom Kenya Web Solutions launches MyBIGOrder app for shopping deliveries   09:44 CET | News 
Oracom Kenya Web Solutions has developed MyBIGOrder, an integrated order-taking application. The buyer logs in to the platform and places an order, the order request goes to both the merchant and the drivers, and the merchant assigns the nearest driver to make the delivery. Alphonce Juma, the CEO of Oracom, told the Star that he spent six years designing the app. 
The app uses geo-fencing to locate businesses near the buyer. It helps buyers to acquire goods and services directly from the manufacturer without involving intermediaries. The e-commerce app connects sellers with more consumers. For business owners who want to sign up, a membership fee of between KES 450 and KES 450,000 is charged. 
Those paying a subscription of KES 450 are allowed to post only five products and sell to not more than fifteen people. According to Juma, using the app saves on purchasing time, expands sales, helps in promoting businesses and brands and is convenient. It is effective in reducing costs since it has an automated delivery system. 
The company has a customer support centre operating around the clock, and customers can communicate via WhatsApp, texts, calls, live chats and Webinars.
