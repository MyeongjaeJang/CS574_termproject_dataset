Amazon Spain introduces EUR 4.99 a month Prime subscription   10:03 CET | News 
Amazon has launched a new monthly version of its Prime service in Spain without yet hiking the price of the annual subscription. The monthly version costs EUR 4.99, equivalent to nearly EUR 60 a year, compared to the current annual rate of EUR 19.95. It comes with the same advantages as the annual subscription, including 24-hour shipments, no delivery charges for purchases over EUR 30, access to Prime Video, Twitch Prime games and unlimited cloud photo storage. Recent reports suggested the company is considering doubling or even tripling the annual price of subscribing to Prime in Spain to match countries such as France and Germany, where the bundled services are similar.
