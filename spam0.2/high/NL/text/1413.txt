Discussing the first month, Will Harborne, Ethfinex Project Lead said: 
“We are happy to see gradual user and volume growth as we continue development and prepare to exit Beta mode. Today we are launching a new set of tools to make it easier for Nectar token holders to start to contribute to shaping the next stage of Ethfinex’s development.” The above chart shows 50% of trading fees in all currencies collected. 1976.58 ETH were collected during the month and pledged to NEC token holders. Note that fees cannot be extrapolated to trading volume directly as users can set their preferred fee currency (hence the popularity of BTC and USD). 
As the team looks ahead to April, the first governance votes will be prepared for NEC holders. A matter concerning the ecosystem right now is the lowering of the 10k USD minimum equity required to trade on Ethfinex. The team says it is prepared to remove this as it has developed a strong support team to assist a growing user base. The requirement was initially put in place to reduce the influx of new users while the support and compliance teams scaled. 
Some items Ethfinex developers will push forward next will be the integration of a non-custodial trading portal for trading via MetaMask and Ledger. The team is also working on verification improvements with current processes taking 4-6 weeks to finish. The aim is for Ethfinex to decrease the verification wait time drastically while remaining 100% compliant. Last worth noting, the exchange will be focusing on adding support for popular Ethereum projects taking into consideration user demand.
