Hispasat, Eurona bring satellite-based broadband to Castille-Leon Tuesday 20 March 2018 | 08:56 CET | News 
Satellite operator Hispasat and telecommunications services provider Eurona have announced the launch of their new satellite-based broadband service for underserved localities in the northern region of Castille-Leon. The partners said some 800,000 people in digital divide areas can now access the internet at speeds of up to 30Mbps at a price of EUR 39.90 for a convergent package. Previously, 350,000 of those inhabitants had connections that barely reached 10Mbps, added the companies. Eurona will provide the service after agreeing to pay around EUR 100 million for 15 years of access to the Ka band capacity of Hispasatâ€™s 36W-1 and 30W-6 satellites. The company underlined that users in localities with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants and no fixed broadband access can apply for up to EUR 400 in government aid to activate a 30Mbps-plus connection.
