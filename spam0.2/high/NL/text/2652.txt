Enel, through its Peruvian renewable energy subsidiary Enel Green Power Peru (EGPP), started operations at the 180 MW 1 Rubi solar PV plant, which is Perus largest solar plant and Enels first solar facility in the country. To celebrate this milestone, an inauguration ceremony was held on site which saw the participation of Perus Minister of Energy and Mines Angela Grossheim Barrientos, as well as Antonio Cammisecra, Head of Enels Global Renewable Energies Division Enel Green Power (EGP), Luca D´Agnese, Enels Head of South America, and Carlos Temboury, Enels Country Manager for Peru. 
 The inauguration of Perus largest solar PV plant is testament to our commitment to boost the development of renewables in the country, contributing to the diversification of its generation mix and increasing energy production from clean sources in Perus Southern region by 12%, said Antonio Cammisecra , Head of EGP. The entry into service of Rubi just over a year after construction began strengthens our ambition to keep growing in Peru and to harness the countrys great renewable potential. 
Enel invested around 170 million US dollars in the construction of Rubi, as part of the investments outlined in the companys current strategic plan. The project, which is located in the city of Moquegua in Perus Mariscal Nieto province, is financed in part through Enel Groups own resources and in part by the European Investment Bank. The facility is supported by a 20-year power purchase agreement signed with Perus Ministry of Energy and Mines. Once fully operational, Rubi will be able to generate around 440 GWh per year, which will be delivered to Perus National Interconnected Electricity System (SEIN) through the Montalvo substation.
