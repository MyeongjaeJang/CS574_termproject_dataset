7TV, the German streaming TV offering co-owned by ProSiebenSat.1 Group and Discovery, has added the first external channels to the service. 
7TV users will now have access to video content from Constantin Media-owned sports network Sport1 and Axel Springer-owned WeltN24’s Welt and N24 Doku channels. The agreements include both live-streaming and catch-up content. 
Separately, 7TV, which was launched in October, has named Alexander von Woikowsky as chief content officer and managing director of 7TV to oversee partnerships and distribution. He joins from ProSiebenSat.1, where he has worked as a director of key account management in the distribution department. 
The service launched with an offer of seven channels – ProSieben, SAT.1, Kabel eins, DMAX, Sixx, ProSieben MAXX, Sat.1 Gold, Kabel Eins Doku, and TLC. There is also a Eurosport zone with sports highlights and videos. 
Alexander Vassilev, CEO of 7TV, said: “The new content partners underscore our persistent strategy of an open approach and our endeavour to create the VOD platform for German speaking TV content and live TV for all digital channels through 7TV.”
