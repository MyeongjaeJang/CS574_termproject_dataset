KHARTOUM - 26 Mar 2018 Sudanese NISS release senior opposition leaders 
Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS) on Saturday night released eight opposition leaders who have been in detention since the beginning of the year. 
The eight include the spokesman of the Sudanese Communist Party Fathi Fadul, lawyer and former judge Mohammed al-Hafiz, and Sudanese Republican Party political secretary Haidar al-Safi. 
The NISS arrested more than 60 political detainees after opposition parties organised peaceful protests over rising prices of basic goods in January. Many more still remain in detention including the Sudanese Communist Party secretary Mohamed Mokhtar Al-Khatib.
