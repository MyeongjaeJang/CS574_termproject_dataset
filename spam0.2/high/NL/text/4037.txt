The 3 Italia brand of operator Wind Tre has launched what it describes as the first all-you-can-eat mobile data plan available in the Italian market, albeit tied to a fixed fibre-optic contract. The new Power-branded plans come with unlimited calls to all national numbers, 1,000 SMS and 100GB of data with the Gigabank rollover option for any unused data for EUR 25 a month (All-In Power Tre) and EUR 34 a month (Free Power) with a smartphone, plus a EUR 19 activation fee. 
However, to access the plans customers have to sign up to a 24-month 3Fiber plan with fixed line calls to landlines in Italy plus 20Mbps ADSL broadband or fibre broadband at 100, 200 or 1000Mbps where available for EUR 24.90 a month. The offer is initially available until 22 April.
