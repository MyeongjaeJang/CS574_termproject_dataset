Planning a Las Vegas vacation? Better boost your hotel budget. 
Resort fees, those mandatory nightly charges for Internet service, fitness center use and other "perks'' that hotels insist guests want in one bundle, are increasing on and off the Las Vegas Strip. 
Visitors will pay as much as $45 a night plus tax on top of the room rate. You won't find a resort fee below $32 a night on the Strip. And you could pay up to $30 per night at Fremont Street hotels downtown .
