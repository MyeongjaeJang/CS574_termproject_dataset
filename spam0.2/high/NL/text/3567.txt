Digicel Group revamps management team, structure Friday 23 March 2018 | 11:23 CET | News As it enters the second year of its Digicel 2030 global transformation programme, the operator has unveiled its new Group senior management team and a leaner structure from top to bottom. Led by Digicel Group CEO Alexander Matuschka, who took up this position at the beginning of February, the new Group senior management team comprises Group CFO Ray Leclercq, Group chief people officer Chris Severson, Group chief legal, regulatory and external affairs officer Tristan Gilbertson and Group COO Hussain Suliman. 
According to Digicel, “to ensure that the senior team is as close to customers as possible and to drive fast and effective decision making”, the company’s six large markets will report directly to the Group CEO, with the remaining markets also reporting to him via a cluster structure.With clusters comprising 4 to 6 markets of smaller size but with similar characteristics and market drivers, the cluster markets are expected to benefit from closer proximity, guidance and support from senior management. This delayering approach is consistent with the plans announced at the launch of the Digicel 2030 global transformation programme and represents the next planned phase of the programme.
