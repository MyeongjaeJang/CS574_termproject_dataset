Kenyan ISP Mawingu Networks has announced plans to deploy affordable internet services in Samburu, Isiolo and Kirinyaga in northern and central Kenya. This follows a roll-out in Nanyuki and its surrounding towns of Laikipia, Embu, Meru and Nyeri. The network uses TV white space and has connected over 67,000 people at prices from KES 10 for 50 MB, with speeds ranging from 2 Mbps to 30 Mbps. 
Since its inception in 2013, Mawingu has deployed 1,000 hotspots and also connects 600 small businesses to affordable internet. The ISP has also connected 26 schools, Laikipia County Government office, the Red Cross, and Budguret Dispensary Healthcare Clinic. In 2016, Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) committed KES 400 million in financing to help Mawingu commercially expand into more rural communities. Microsoft also bought a 10 percent stake in the firm.
