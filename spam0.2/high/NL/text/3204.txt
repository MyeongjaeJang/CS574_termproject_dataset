COIMBATORE: Tamil Nadu unit BJP President Tamilisai Soundararajan and General Secretary Vanathi Srinivasan were among the over 650 party workers arrested for attempting to stage a demonstration protesting against the police inaction in protecting party cadres, in view of the hurling of petrol bomb on the house of District Party President C.R. Nandakumar a couple of days ago. 
Tamilisai, who led the demonstration, said that it was an irony that workers of BJP were at the receiving end, where they were the victims of the attack and also being punished. 
“Despite intelligence report, police failed to take action against the miscreants who were targeting BJP leaders, the latest being the hurling of petrol bomb on the house of Nandakumar, which damaged an SUV, parked in the porch of the house,” she said. 
She also alleged that many persons, having link like funding to terrorist outfits were arrested from the city of Coimbatore by National Investigation Agency. 
The party workers including former MP C.P. Radhakrishnan, State Treasurer S.R. Sekhar raised slogans against the attack and wanted the police to bring to book the culprits at the earliest. ALSO READ
