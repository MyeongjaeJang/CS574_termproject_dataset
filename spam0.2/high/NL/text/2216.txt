It’s looking set to be a very exciting end to the season for Chelsea. Though they began the season as title contenders, Antonio Conte’s men quickly dropped off, with a top-four finish now the goal of Antonio Conte’s men. 
They’ve also got an FA Cup semi-final with Southampton to contend with, and so it’s fair to say that the next few weeks could prove to be season-defining for the Blues. 
Fortunately, ahead of that period, Antonio Conte has been handed a boost. 
According to the Telegraph, Ross Barkley will return to training next week after a spell on the sidelines, having suffered another hamstring injury. He’s yet to really make an impact at Stamford Bridge, given his fitness problems, but that could all change over the coming weeks. 
Of course, the Englishman may not get a chance to feature until he’s back to 100%, but it’s clear that he is working to that end. 
An attacking midfielder by trade, Barkley will offer Conte another option in the attack, with the likes of Willian, Pedro and Eden Hazard forced to play a lot of football over the last few weeks. 
Given how many games are on the horizon – Chelsea are set to play up to six times in April – squad depth will be crucial, and Barkley will have a role to play. 
Verdict 
Barkley was never expected to make much of an impact this term, but he has struggled even by those expectations. 
He needs to end the season well in an effort to force his way back into Antonio Conte’s plans, and also to get him back into the good books of the Chelsea faithful. 
On his day, he’s an unstoppable player, and Chelsea have lacked creativity as of late. 
The pressure will be on him to succeed, though.
