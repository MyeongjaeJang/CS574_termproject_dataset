Spark launches long-range IoT network across New Zealand   10:03 CET | News Spark has announced that its long-range, low-power network is now available for commercial use in 60 percent of the places New Zealanders live and work. Businesses and local councils can use the LoRaWAN-based network to connect to things like vehicles, waterways, machinery and carparks. Sensors on these objects are able to send information over the network to the people managing the objects. Commands can also be sent back to sensors, telling them when to kick in or the kind of information to report on, Spark also said. 
“While we currently have 60% of rural and urban New Zealand covered, we’ll be working to extend that to 70% by July this year. We’re also looking to partner with organisations to extend coverage into areas where they need it”, said Michael Stribling, Spark’s general manager IoT services. 
Spark has been testing its LoRaWAN service on trial sites for well over a year, with partners from a range of industries, including agriculture, marine and smart buildings. The network has been switched on, and enables councils to operate and maintain key infrastructure in smarter ways, Spark said. Councils are expected to be able to use the smart lighting technology to manage streetlights remotely, applying bespoke dimming profiles, monitoring maintenance and turning them on or off as needed. 
Spark is delivering two public, standards-based IoT networks, CAT-M1 and LoRaWAN, to serve different use-cases. Both come with mature global ecosystems. It continues to monitor use cases for NB-IoT technology. Spark’s LoRaWAN coverage is currently available in Auckland, Tauranga, Hamilton, Rotorua, Palmerston North, Shannon, Wellington, Nelson, Blenheim, Christchurch, Dunedin. Sites in Hastings and Invercargill will go live in the next few weeks.
