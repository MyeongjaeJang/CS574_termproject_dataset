UK mobile phone repeater regulations come into force in April Thursday 22 March 2018 | 12:04 CET | News 
UK regulator Ofcom has confirmed the making of regulations to allow people to use certain types of mobile phone repeaters without a licence. The new regulations will come into force on 12 April 2018 and are known as the Wireless Telegraphy (Mobile Repeater) (Exemption) Regulations 2018. 
The making of these regulations follows a decision in October 2017 that licences would no longer be required to use two types of repeaters. These two categories are static mobile phone repeaters for indoor use, and low-gain mobile phone repeaters for in-vehicle use, but only when complying with required technical standards and conditions of use. The unlicensed installation of wideband repeaters will remain illegal.
