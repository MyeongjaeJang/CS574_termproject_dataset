While shooting for director Vishwas Paandya’s Baa Baaa Black Sheep, Kay Kay Menon in a sequence had just one line in the scene with Maniesh Paul. Whereas the latter had many lines to deliver and he had an acting lesson during the scene. 
Remembering the incident, director Vishwas Paandya says,”I told Maniesh you better be alert in this scene. Maniesh exclaimed that he has all the lines, I told him that is the reason I am asking you to be alert is because Kay Kay is such a fantastic actor that he will take the scene away without any lines.” Which is what exactly happened and gave Maniesh a brilliant learning experience. 
Baa Baaa Black Sheep, directed by Vishwas Paandya, stars Maniesh Paul, Anupam Kher, Annu Kapoor, Manjari Fadnnis & Kay Kay Menon in a special appearance. Produced by Anand Swarup Agarwal & Krishna Datla, under the banner Agastya Films, it is a Soham Rockstar Entertainment and Swarup Productions presentation. The film will release on March 23rd, 2018.
