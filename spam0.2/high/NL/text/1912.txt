T-Mobile Netherlands abandons OTT TV service Knippr Wednesday 21 March 2018 | 16:15 CET | News 
T-Mobile Netherlands has announced it will end its OTT TV service Knippr from 01 June. First started in 2016, the service failed to attract a significant number of subscribers. 
The OTT streaming service is offered standalone, without the need for a pay-TV, broadband or mobile contract with T-Mobile. It was designed under T-Mobile's 'mobile-first' strategy, targeting a young generation accustomed to consuming video online. The basic package includes the main channels in the Netherlands, to which additional channels could be added on an 'a la carte' basis. 
T-Mobile said Knippr was unable to reach sufficient scale, making it difficult to improve the content offering for the low price. Tisha van Lammeren, director of consumer marketing, said the company still sees potential for such a service, but Knippr was too early to reach a mass market. T-Mobile will continue with the 'a la carte' philosophy, while also offering bundles. The technical knowledge accumulated through Knippr will be used to strengthen its other services. 
Based on the Telecompaper Consumer Insights panel, we estimate Knipper has less than 10,000 subscribers. Free Headlines in your E-mail
