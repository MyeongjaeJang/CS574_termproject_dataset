Wire Service Sealed Air Wins 2018 National Restaurant Association Kitchen Innovation Award Cryovac FlexPrep dispensing system demonstrates innovation by delivering portion-control and improved food safety to the application of condiments Charlotte, NC, United States – WEBWIRE – Monday, March 26, 2018 
Sealed Air ( NYSE:SEE ) has received the 2018 Kitchen Innovations Ž (KI) Award presented by the National Restaurant Association, Hotel-Motel Show Ž for its Cryovac FlexPrep system, a solution offering pouch-based condiment packaging and dispensing. 
Announced on February 22, the Cryovac FlexPrep system was one of 22 innovations to receive the prestigious food service industry award in 2018 for equipment and solutions delivering advances that meaningfully improve back-of-house operations. 
According to the National Restaurant Association, the 2018 KI Award recipients reflect the trends and topics most important to foodservice operators today. KI Award recipients are innovators in back-of-house operations and work tirelessly to improve the challenges faced by restaurant operators, said Dickie Brennan, restaurant group owner and Convention Chair for the 2018 National Restaurant Association Show. For fourteen years, the industry has admired KI Award recipients and their contribution to making our foodservice industry even better. 
The Cryovac FlexPrep system is revolutionizing the way back-of-house condiments and sauces are packaged and dispensed, changing out paperboard or other rigid canisters for flexible pouches. Pre-filled Cryovac FlexPrep pouches are inserted into a proprietary dispensing unit with ergonomic handles and a clear plastic cylinder that allows up to 98% evacuation. 
From a food safety perspective, the contents of a Cryovac FlexPrep pouch are hermetically sealed with no headspace in Cryovac Ž oxygen barrier film and do not come in contact with human hands, cutting tools or other utensils during kitchen operations. 
When compared to current food service condiment packaging options, the Cryovac FlexPrep dispensing system delivers improved portion control and food safety, better optimized shipping cost, and better utilization of storage space, as well as decreased packaging and condiment waste. 
Sauces and condiments allow food service operators to easily experiment with new flavors as the means to expand their menus. At the same time, while menu choices are growing, kitchen, storage, and refrigeration space is actually shrinking, said Lucian Gray, market development director for Sealed Air Food Care. The Cryovac FlexPrep system offers a way for food service operators to address both issues  and were thrilled to see it recognized by the National Restaurant Association for the benefits it provides. 
The Cryovac FlexPrep dispensing system will be featured in the Kitchen Innovations Showroom at the 2018 National Restaurant Association Show to be held May 19-22 in Chicago at McCormick Place.
