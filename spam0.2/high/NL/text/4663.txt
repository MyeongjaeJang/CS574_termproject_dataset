Israeli PM questioned again in telecom corruption case Monday 26 March 2018 | 16:03 CET | News 
Israeli police have questioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the second time in a corruption case involving telecommunications operator Bezeq, PressTV reported. Police assert that Bezeq owner Shaul Elovitch had instructed the Walla news website, which is fully owned by the telecom company, to provide favorable coverage of Netanyahu and his wife in return for favors from communications regulators. Netanyahu denies the claims. 
The police, who have yet to make a recommendation about charges in the case, reportedly questioned the prime minister in his official residence in Jerusalem al-Quds. Shlomo Filber, the former director general of the Communications Ministry, and Nir Hefetz, a former spokesman of Netanyahu, have agreed to serve as the regime's witnesses in the case. The final decision about whether to prosecute him rests with the Israeli attorney general, which could take months.
