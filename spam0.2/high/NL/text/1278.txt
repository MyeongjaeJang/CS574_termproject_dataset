Wire Service OSHA Cites Illinois Company for Combustible Dust Hazards and Other Violations EMSL Analytical, Inc, provides combustible dust testing services and air monitoring instruments to help prevent injuries, deaths and the destruction of property. Chicago, IL – WEBWIRE   
Earlier this year, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) announced over $91,000 in proposed penalties for a pallet manufacturer in Illinois. This was the result of repeated violations including six serious and three other-than-serious. 
One of the violations was for allowing combustible dust to accumulate on surfaces in the facility. Combustible dusts are fine particles that present an explosion hazard when suspended in air under certain conditions. OSHA reports that five elements are necessary to initiate a dust explosion, often referred to as the Dust Explosion Pentagon. The first three elements are those needed for a fire, i.e., the familiar Fire Triangle: Combustible dust (fuel); 
An additional two elements must be present for a combustible dust explosion: Dispersion of dust particles in sufficient quantity and concentration; and, Confinement of the dust cloud. 
If one of the above five elements is missing, an explosion cannot occur. The ease of ignition and the severity of a combustible dust explosion are also typically influenced by particle size. Other factors that influence the explosiveness of dusts include moisture content, ambient humidity, oxygen available for combustion, the shape of dust particles and the concentration of dust in the air. 
OSHA lists a number of industries at risk for combustible dust explosions, they include: agriculture, chemicals, food (e.g., candy, sugar, spice, starch, flour, feed), grain, fertilizer, tobacco, plastics, wood, forest, paper, pulp, rubber, furniture, textiles, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, tire and rubber manufacturing, dyes, coal, metal processing (e.g., aluminum, chromium, iron, magnesium and zinc), recycling operations, and fossil fuel power generation (coal). 
It is critical to prevent conditions from developing in an indoor environment that could allow for a dust explosion, said Joe Frasca, Senior Vice President of Marketing at EMSL Analytical, Inc. When they occur, they are often catastrophic, resulting in employee deaths, injuries and the destruction of buildings. A key component of any safety program designed to identify potential combustible dust dangers is indoor environmental testing and monitoring. At EMSL, our scientists work to prevent these hazards by offering comprehensive combustible dust testing services and real-time air monitoring instruments.
