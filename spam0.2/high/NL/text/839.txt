Wire Service Groundbreaking NAB Show Session Transports Creative Professionals and Scientists to Future of Content Production -- NASA JPL expert, high-profile media execs, and futurist Marco Tempest highlight whats possible today and tomorrow with cloud media services and artificial intelligence -- WASHINGTON, D.C. – WEBWIRE – Tuesday, March 20, 2018 
NAB Show will feature an exclusive keynote session that provides a front-row seat to the future of content creation. The session, produced by Amazon Web Services, will explore the latest cloud-based media workflows combined with advanced machine learning to deliver next-level, immersive viewing experiences. The keynote event is divided into three acts and will take place Wednesday, April 11 at 11:00 a.m. on the NAB Show Main Stage in the North Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC). 
Act one of the session, Race on the Red Planet: Chasing our Creative Future With Curiosity and Opportunity, will tell the story of a high-pressure, over-the-top (OTT) video event involving NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) rovers on Mars. The producers are stymied by a series of complicated challenges, such as scaling up cloud resources to address demand spikes, personalized ad insertion, language translation and captioning, and on-the-fly highlight package creation. Will they be able to overcome the issues? Audience members at the LVCC and online will learn if the producers are able to resolve their dilemmas in real time. 
In remarks by futurist Marco Tempest, act two of the session will feature a peek into the role video and machine learning technologies will play on Earth and in the journey to Mars. Tempest serves as a creative technologist and advisor to organizations such as NASA JPL. Also a Directors Fellow at the MIT MediaLab and Founder and Director of the MagicLab, Tempest will offer insights and inspiration for creating more immersive experiences. 
The third and final act of the NAB keynote session features a panel discussion between high-profile media brand and scientific technology leaders who are leveraging cloud media workflows and looking to machine learning and artificial intelligence to enrich those processes. 
The show will be encoded and delivered by AWS. AWS Elemental will deliver a live stream of the event via an AWS media workflow that includes Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon Route 53, and Amazon CloudFront for public access at https://live.awsevents.com.
