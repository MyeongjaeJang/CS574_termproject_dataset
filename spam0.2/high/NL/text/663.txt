Margot Robbie has already earned her spot as one of Hollywood's coolest actresses, but her latest selfie might be the cutest. 
The "I, Tonya" star posed for a picture with a quokka — an adorable furry little animal — during a trip to Rottnest Island, Western Australia. In the super cute snap, Margot is doing a kiss face while the tiny little animal mugs for the camera. A post shared by @ margotrobbie on Mar 18, 2018 at 11:32pm PDT 
Let's be honest — up until about 10 mins ago we had no idea what a quokka even was -- but the little guy, which looks like a mix between a squirrel and a koala is already our favorite thing ever. 
Thanks Margot, for the cuteness overload on a Monday. Copyright ©
