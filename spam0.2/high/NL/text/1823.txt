A new digital skills university is planned in Milton Keynes, UK, with the city council selecting Cranfield University as lead higher education partner. Other partners in the project include Microsoft, Tech Mahindra, MK College and Grant Thornton. It will offer accelerated 2-year degrees, 3-year intensive degrees with project placements, part-time/apprenticeship courses, and short courses/continued professional development. 
The new university will provide a STEM-focused undergraduate programme in key areas such as cyber, autonomy, digital, robotics and artificial intelligence, working with industry to prepare students for work in the 21st century. There will be a lead business partner for each of the key areas of focus. The first students at MK:U are expected to start in 2023, with around 5,000 students eventually expected to study there. An 18-month feasibility study will now examine planning, design and financing of the new university.
