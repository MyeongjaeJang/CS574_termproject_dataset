Ofcom implements new customer service and nuisance call rules   14:07 CET | News 
UK regulator Ofcom has announced the implementation of a series of new rules designed to strengthen its powers to deal with companies that “persistently misuse” the telephone numbers it allocates. In a statement the watchdog said it now has the power to take back blocks of numbers which are systematically used to cause harm or anxiety to people, such as to make nuisance calls or perpetrate scams or fraud. 
Ofcom also published new guidance for phone, broadband and pay-TV providers, providing examples of how they should handle customer requests to cancel their contract. Best practice includes offering customers different ways to contact their provider to cancel, such as via phone, webchat or email, and ensuring incentive schemes for customer service agents do not encourage poor behaviour. 
Finally, the regulator also updated a direction first made in 2003 specifying which public bodies may request communications services to be restored in the event of disasters. The new rules and guidance will take effect from 01 October 2018, the same day the revised general conditions come into force.
