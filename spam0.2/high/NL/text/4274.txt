EU says it still might break up Google by Email 
Best not to rule it out 
The European Union holds “grave suspicions” about the dominance of internet giant Google and has not ruled out breaking it up, according to the EU’s antitrust chief. 
According to the Telegraph , the European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager reckons the threat to split Google into smaller companies must be kept open. 
"I think it important to keep that question open and on the agenda", she said when asked if the only solution to its dominance was to break up the company. "We are not there yet but it is important to keep an awakened eye". She warned that the search engine could become so big as to be indispensable for businesses and the economy. 
Google faces new EU rules on its commercial practices with smaller businesses that use its services. Late last year, Vestager said more cases against Google were likely in the future, after the European Commission slapped a record $2.97 billion fine on the world’s most popular internet search engine and told the firm to stop favouring its shopping service. 
The European Commission is in the process of drafting a new regulation aimed at regulating e-commerce sites, app stores and search engines to be more transparent in how they rank search results and why they delist some services.
