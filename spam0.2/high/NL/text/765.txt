Bengaluru: Students of MVJ College of Engineering have designed a Bluetooth based attendance tracking system called a BT Proxy that helps in tracking the student’s attendance, which has been a topic of discussion for students across platforms. Attendance management system is most widely used in schools, colleges etc. 
If a class has a strength of say 40 to 50 students it might not be an issue to complete the attendance within 5 minutes. But what if the class has say 100 students! The teacher may waste a lot of time in taking attendance itself. So, students came up with an automatic Bluetooth based attendance system called Proxy. This can reduce the time consumed for attendance and more concentration can be given to the subject. The low energy Bluetooth modules will be implanted inside the id card of the student. 
This module is very small compared to regular Bluetooth module. It also consumes very less power. Each module is powered up by a button battery and can last up to a year. Each module will be given a unique id, and the id can only be set/reset by the administrator. 
Every class will have a atmega32 module, HC05, Bluetooth module, and a WIFI module. An RTC module will keep track of the time. Class periods, break etc., can be set as required. Once a class starts, the module automatically scans for all the Bluetooth ids and passes on the data to the attendance monitoring application or any other required destination. 
There won’t be interference with ids as each id has a unique code. The main goal of this project is to eliminate time consumed in taking attendance. It can be used in schools, colleges, office etc.
