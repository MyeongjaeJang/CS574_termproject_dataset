Suzlon Group, India’s largest renewable energy solutions provider, has designed & manufactured the country’s longest wind turbine blade at its Padubidri Rotor Blade Unit. 
The advanced blade (SB 63) measures 63 meters in length & has been specifically developed for Suzlon’s new S128 wind turbine family, with a rotor diameter of 128 meters, 1.5 times taller than the India Gate monument in terms of height. 
This blade has been engineered with a carbon girder which provides the capability to utilize thinner aerodynamic profiles & delivers higher lift with less drag to contribute to the turbine’s excellent performance in low wind sites. 
The blade also incorporates flat back technology at the root that minimizes drag & saves additional weight and cost. 
The S128 series offers ~33 percent more swept area (12,860 m2) & is expected to deliver ~32 percent more energy generation compared to the S111. 
With an increase in the swept area, Suzlon’s next generation turbine is well equipped to improve energy yield & support competitive tariff environment in India, while protecting our customers' return on investment. 
These rotor blades will be transported using an innovative two-fold transport system, which will use a specialized ‘Adapter Trailer’ for the first time in India. 
This innovative approach will ensure a safe, cost effective & time efficient mode of transport for the 63 meters-long rotor blade to the most remote areas. SOURCE: Insights Liked this post?
