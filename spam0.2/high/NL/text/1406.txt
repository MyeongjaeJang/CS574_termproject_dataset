  750 tonner for Ireland 
Liebherr LTM 1750-9.1 
20. March 2018 
Irish rental company East Cork Crane Hire has taken delivery of a 750 tonne Liebherr LTM 1750-9.1 All Terrain crane. 
The nine axle LTM 1750-9.1 is rated at three metres and features a 52 metre main boom topped by up to 91 metres of lattice jib. 
Managing director Aidan Kelleher said: "We bought our first Liebherr crane – the LTM 1090 – in 1997 and have enjoyed a good working relationship with Liebherr ever since. Liebherr’s aftersales backup and constant innovation have been second to none. 
Over the years, we have gradually expanded our range of cranes, predominantly with Liebherr machines, culminating in the purchase of our first LTM 1500-8.1 in 2013. This crane has been a great all-rounder and the purchase of the LTM 1750-9.1 is a natural progression as it enables us to offer our customers a wide ranging, efficient service."
