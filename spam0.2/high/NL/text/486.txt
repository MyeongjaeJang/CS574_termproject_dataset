Bezeq CEO Handler to resign   15:23 CET | News 
Israeli operator Bezeq's CEO Stella Handler, who is under police investigation, will resign on 01 July after five years in the post, Reuters reported. Handler was arrested in February in connection with an investigation into allegations that included fraud, bribery and securities offences. She was released from police custody but a court ordered she stay away from Bezeq for 30 days. 
Along with Handler, Bezeqâ€™s controlling shareholder and former chairman Shaul Elovitch and a number of other officials connected to Bezeq were arrested. They all deny any wrongdoing. The company in February named Yakov Paz as interim chief executive for at least a month while the investigation proceeds. Handler said the move is the right thing to do both from "my personal point of view and from the point of view of Bezeq".
