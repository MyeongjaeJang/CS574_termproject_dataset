Former CIA agent warns about the worst rooms you can book in a hotel news.com.au 
WHAT do you look for in a hotel room? Close to the pool? Great view from the window? 
Well, it turns out the most important thing is that it isn't on the ground or the top floor of the hotel. 
That's the opinion of Drew Dwyer, a marine corps veteran and former CIA agent. 
With the number of terror attacks on tourists on the rise, Mr Dwyer has shared a list of tips for how to travel safely when on holiday with US military news site Sofrep.com . 
While some of his tips might seem a tad paranoid — like keeping the TV on a low volume at all times in case the room is bugged — some could actually save a life during an attack, including his advice on requesting a room that is neither on the ground floor nor the top floor, The Sun reported.
