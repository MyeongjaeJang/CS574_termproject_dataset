Monaco Marine established their eighth facility located on the Côte d’Azur earlier this year in Marseille, and have recently waved goodbye to their first superyacht client after a successful completion of minor works and hull survey on the 62.4-metre Madame Kate . 
Built by Dutch yard Amels in 2015, Madame Kate features exterior design by Tim Heywood and an interior by Laura Sessa Romboli, and is now heading to the eastern French Riviera in tip-top condition. 
The new Monaco Marine Marseille facility is able to accommodate the world’s largest superyachts thanks to a dock of 320-metres. Two workshops of 250 square metres respectively each complete the 8,700 square metre site. Commenting on the establishment of their latest facility, Monaco Marine states: “ Our customers requested us to be able to supply a very fast technical solution to ensure to minimise the maintenance time period and to obtain the shortest transition between guests turnover. Thanks to its new installation, Monaco Marine can now prepare and welcome short maintenance period with an adaptable capability on its facility corresponding to the specific needs of each client. Thanks to its experience regarding project management, know-how and huge refits, Monaco Marine assists them to achieve the time performance while keeping the highest quality standards. ” Advertisement
