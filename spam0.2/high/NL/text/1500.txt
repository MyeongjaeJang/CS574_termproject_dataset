Dutch regulator's helicopter measurements found reliable   08:40 CET | News 
The method Dutch regulator Agentschap Telecom uses to check whether radio stations are in compliance with their permit conditions is reliable, a 2017 validation report from the University of Twente showed. The report was prepared at the request of the then Minister of Economic Affairs. The study was performed to remove questions and concerns from the radio sector about the way the regulator carries out these checks. 
If radio transmitter antennas are not properly adjusted, this can lead to disturbances for other antennas, or a reduction to their range. The regulator has been performing measurements with a helicopter since 2012. The helicopter flies around broadcast antennas and plots out 'antenna diagrammes,' with an eye for factors such as radiation or power direction. 
The report said the method used was “valid, reliable and reproducible.”
