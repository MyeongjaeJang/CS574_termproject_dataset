Deep, restful sleep is vitally important to health and wellbeing. However, achieving it is often easier said than done, and true relaxation can come from unexpected sources. Sealy UK reveals the (perhaps surprising) benefits a vegan diet can bring those seeking the ultimate night’s sleep … 
Many vegan foods contain high levels of sleep-inducing chemicals, such as serotonin, tryptophan, and melatonin – all of which have a positive impact on quality of sleep, reports Sealy UK. 
The body uses tryptophan to produce serotonin, the feel-good hormone that helps relieve feelings of depression and anxiety. This is then used to produce melatonin, which regulates the circadian rhythm. When combined, all of these chemicals aid a deep, restful night’s sleep. 
Specific foods to consume when trying to achieve this include: 
• Kale – this contains a useful alternative to dairy products when it comes to the daily intake of calcium, which is a natural sleep aid 
• Bananas – these contain a naturally high level of amino acid, tryptophan, which has a sedative effect. Levels of magnesium and potassium, which work to relax the muscles, are also high in bananas 
• Oats – as a natural source of melatonin, oats can help aid a peaceful night’s sleep 
• Chamomile tea – handy for de-stressing, this drink promotes anti-anxiety effects in the body, which will encourage deep sleep 
Of course, the vegan lifestyle is not just about eating correctly – it involves investing in environmentally-friendly products that have been created from naturally-produced ingredients. For those already following a vegan lifestyle but wishing to apply elements of this philosophy to their home, Sealy’s recently-unveiled Naturals Collection can offer a suitable match.

Sealy’s sales and marketing director, Neil Robinson, comments: “The vegan lifestyle is becoming more and more popular due to the numerous health benefits, and it transpires that achieving a good night’s sleep is one of these. However, a comfortable and supportive bed is every bit as important, which is why choosing the correct mattress for your body is so crucial.
