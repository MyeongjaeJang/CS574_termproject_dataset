 Report: GSI Clinches USD 150 Mn Tanker Order
CSSC Shipping and Singapore-based IMC Industrial have reportedly exercised an option for four more tankers with Chinese shipbuilder Guangzhou Shipyard International (GSI).
Under the agreement, the shipbuilder, which is part of China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), would construct and deliver the tankers to IMC’s Aurora Tankers in 2020 and 2021, Clarksons said.
The four 55,000 dwt ships are said to be worth USD 37 million, bringing the total value of the deal to around USD 150 million.
The newbuildings bring Aurora Tankers’s orderbook to eight ships, as four IMO II MR tankers have already been booked at GSI.
The first quartet from the batch is set for delivery in 2019 and 2020.
Aurora Tankers’ live fleet is composed of 14 ships, ranging from 19,000 to 45,000 dwt, totaling in 866,200 dwt, data from VesselsValue shows.
The company has been involved in wet bulk shipping for more than 15 years, operating on trade routes from Middle East and USA to Asia.
