Dutch municipalities score low on GDPR preparation - study   16:25 CET | News Dutch Municipal officials have graded the preparations of their own employer for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy act, giving an average of 6, according to a survey by SC online and Gemeente.nu. A quarter said preparations at their municipality were downright insufficient while 38 percent gave their municipality a score of 8 or higher. 
Among the downsides listed are the not yet finalized decision-making, no provision of information to employees about their role with regard to the GDPR and low awareness about its impact. 
One third of the respondents stated in their answers that no Data Protection Officer (FG) has yet been appointed in their municipality, mandatory for municipalities. Most respondents said that their municipality was working on it. The Dutch Data Protection Authority AP has recently indicated that the government organisations will be the first to get checked for the presence of an FG. No immediate high fines 
The AP said recently that it will not start handing out large fines to municipalities on 25 May, when the GDPR goes into effect.
