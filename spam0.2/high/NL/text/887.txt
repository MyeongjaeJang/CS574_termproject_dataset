Today Parliament Street unveils its latest policy paper exploring how UK police forces are preparing for the growing threat posed by cybercrime. Our research paper reveals that UK police forces have spent over £1.3million in training for nearly 40,000 officers and staff over the last three years. 
Key recommendations of the report include creating a national cyber training scheme of officers and staff, sharing training resources and doing more to recruit police staff with existing cyber skills.
