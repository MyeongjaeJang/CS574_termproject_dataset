Pope Francis met on Friday with representatives of the South Sudan Council of Churches and discussed how to promote peace in the country. 
“The Pope holds the suffering people of South Sudan in his heart,” said Council Secretary James Oyet Latansio in a statement following the Vatican meeting with Francis. 
Father Oyet Latansio said the South Sudanese delegation and the pontiff debated ways of resolving the South Sudanese conflict that broke out since December 2013. 
Oyet Latansio further said that Francis reiterated his desire to travel to South Sudan with the Archbishop of Canterbury and head of the Anglican Church Justin Welby, a trip that the Vatican has said is not possible for security reasons. 
“When he comes, we will welcome him,” he said. “The pope can go wherever he wants ... South Sudan has security issues, but we have come from there and we live in it. Anywhere in the world someone can pick up a gun and shoot.” 
South Sudan’s conflict remains a humanitarian crisis, as the violence has caused starvation and the internal displacement of millions. Pope Francis has frequently called for peace in the world’s youngest nation, even declaring an international day of prayer and fasting for the country in February. Share this
