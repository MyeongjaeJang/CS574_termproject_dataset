The winners of this year’s Education Resources Awards (ERAs) have been announced at the gala awards ceremony dinner, held at the National Conference Centre in Birmingham. 
Organised by Brilliant Marketing Solutions and the British Educational Suppliers Association (BESA), the ERAs are firmly established as the premier annual event to celebrate outstanding success for the suppliers and teaching professionals of the education sector throughout the UK. 
The Education Resources Awards highlight the quality and diversity of educational products and resources, excellent educational establishments and the most dedicated members of the teaching profession and supplies industry, all working together to encourage the very best in education. 
For the first time this year, the ERAs also celebrated the best ‘Collaboration between school and supplier’, and the best ‘Start-up of the year’ for the second time. 
Patrick Hayes, director of BESA and Chair of the judging panel, said: “Winning an ERA is a clear sign to the education sector that you are leading the way, with the awards widely recognised by schools, local authorities and across the industry. 
“The competition was of a high calibre, as always, and all finalists should be very proud. On behalf of BESA, I warmly congratulate the ERAs winners!”
