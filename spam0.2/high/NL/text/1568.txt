Avaya launches cloud Master Agent programme   09:49 CET | News 
Avaya Holdings launched a new Master Agent programme focused on accelerating sales of Avaya cloud to small through midmarket businesses. Under the programme, sales agents connect potential customers with Avaya, while Avaya handles the rest of the transaction from contracting, provisioning, managing and billing the unified communications services for the business. 
The company said its new programme addresses the increasing demand for Avaya cloud services while simplifying the process of onboarding, deploying and managing the customer’s communications. Under the programme, agents can offer a platform to customers with support provided directly by Avaya. 
Jenne, an Avaya distribution partner, is the first Avaya Cloud Master Agent and is already seeing interest from the market with the new programme. 
The Master Agent programme provides a new option that rounds out the available choices for customers, channel partners and sales agents to access Avaya’s communications products. This programme complements the opportunity for Avaya Edge Channel Partners who host Avaya IP Office in their own data centres and sell direct to customers under the Partner Powered by Avaya option, depending on their business needs as well as their customers.
