Irish fighters give their predictions for Stephen McAfee v Colin O’Donovan 2 By Joe O'Neill   Features Headline News Lists 
Tomorrow night sees the rematch of one of the Irish Fights of the Year for 2017. 
Following a debated six-round draw in December, Stephen McAfee [2(2)-0-1] and Colin O’Donovan [1(1)-1(1)-1] will go head to head once again in the headline bout of the ‘Celtic Clash 5’ bill at Good Counsel GAA club in Drimnagh. 
The super featherweight pair will battle it out over eight rounds for the BUI Celtic super featherweight title. 
It’s a match-up that has divided opinion and Irish-Boxing.com asked a few of the fighters around the weight who are familiar with the two for their predictions. Widgets Magazine 
There’s a general leaning towards McAfee, the bookies favourite, but it certainly looks too close to call. 
Eric Donovan Kildare 7(4)-0 I couldn’t split them the last time. Some better boxing skills came from O’Donovan throughout but some of the explosive stuff needed for winning rounds came from McAfee to even out the balance. I just don’t know. 
Karl Kelly Dublin 1(0)-1(0) I think Stephen is going to be too strong for him. As you know I’ve been in a war with Stephen and he can stand. For the last fight, Stephen got ten days notice [that he would be fighting O’Donovan] and had to make his gameplan different for a southpaw, southpaws are awkward. My bet is Stephen McAfee, all day. 
Liam Gaynor Dublin 2(0)-0 I can’t really say who’s going to win this one. Two great Irish talents who are out to prove themselves and get further in their career. If I was to pick one it would be McAfee simply because I feel he’s a faster puncher but anything could happen.
