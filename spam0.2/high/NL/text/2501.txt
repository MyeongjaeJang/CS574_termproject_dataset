Lyse gains over 47,000 Altibox customers in FY but digitisation costs hit margins   13:58 CET | News 
Norwegian regional utility Lyse said margins at its telecoms division were hit by a doubling of IT costs as its Altibox television platform and telecoms support systems undergo digitisation. The company ended 2017 with 47,348 new Altibox customers, the greatest organic growth ever seen in the partnership. On 31 December, there were 493,802 active broadband customers, of which 280,551 were on its own fibre. 
Lyse, which is owned by sixteen borough councils, said its telecom operations raised their underlying EBITDA to NOK 848 million in 2017 from NOK 783 million the year before. The underlying operating profit dropped to NOK 485 million from NOK 517 million.. 
Lyse added that Viker Fiber Holding counts as a subsidiary on its books from December, instead of a jointly owned company. This gave Lyse a one-off gain of NOK 952 million. Lyse lifted FY revenue to NOK 7.69 billion from NOK 6.64 billion in 2016, with EBITDA rising to NOK 3.93 billion from NOK 2.69 billion and net profit to NOK 1.94 billion from NOK 796 million.
