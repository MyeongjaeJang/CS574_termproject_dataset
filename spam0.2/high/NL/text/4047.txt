Legendary Creator Frank Miller Signs Five-Project Deal With DC Burbank, CA – WEBWIRE – Monday, March 26, 2018 
Industry icon Frank Miller continues his long-standing relationship with DC as a five-project deal is announced by DC Publishers Dan DiDio and Jim Lee. 
Amongst the planned releases from the legendary writer/artist is a forthcoming graphic novel starring Carrie Kelley, whom Miller created for the genre-defining series Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. Marking Millers first-ever foray into storytelling for young readers, the new graphic novel will feature illustrations by artist Ben Caldwell (Prez). 
This new project will join the previously announced DC Black Label prestige series Superman: Year One, featuring art by John Romita Jr., as part of Millers multi-project deal. 
Frank is a creative force in this industry, not just with a transformative take on iconic characters like Superman and Batman, but also by tackling the young reader genre, says DC Publisher Dan DiDio. He is an icon. As a publisher, Im thrilledas a fan, Im even more excited. 
Frank Miller is an absolute visionary, says DC Publisher Jim Lee. He continues to push the boundaries of storytelling, and I cant wait for a new generation of fans to meet Carrie Kelley. Joining Frank as collaborator on Carrie Kelley is one of my favorite artistsBen Caldwell, a singular talent who brings his stylized, clean line and rock solid, playful storytelling to this project. We couldnt ask for a better creative team. 
In addition to the above two books, Miller will pen three additional upcoming projects yet to be announced. 
I am psyched to continue my partnership with DC, explains Miller. Developing the Carrie Kelley project and Superman: Year One with Dan and Jim has been a dream. Its thrilling to have Carrie Kelley take center stage for the first time, and the energy that Ben is bringing to her is new and differentits incredible to see. Its also a lot of fun working alongside John on Superman: Year One, this project is a childhood dream come true for me.
