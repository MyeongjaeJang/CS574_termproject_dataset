BBVA's Openpay brings China's Alipay to Mexico Monday 26 March 2018 | 11:16 CET | News 
Spanish bank BBVA has announced that its Openpay unit has signed a new agreement to allow users of Chinese mobile payment platform Alipay to purchase goods and services all over Mexico. Openpay is a payment service provider (PSP) that facilitates e-commerce, including on mobile devices, for Mexican large businesses and SMEs. The tie-up between Openpay and Alipay will enable Mexican businesses to tap into the growing Chinese demand for Mexican products, said BBVA. Openpay operates in Mexico through Paynet, its own global network with more than 17,500 associated points-of-sale. BBVA last year signed a deal to become Alipay's bank in Spain and has since developed a banking platform that makes the payment service available in large stores such as El Corte Ingles .
