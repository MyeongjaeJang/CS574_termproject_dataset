NERC bars DisCos from investing in new meter firms Mar 20, 2018 0 59 
The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has barred all the electricity Distribution Companies (DisCos), its core investors, subsidiaries, directors and affiliates from holding any shares in the new Meter Asset Providers (MAP) companies, Daily Trust reports. 
The directive is contained in the MAP Regulations 2018, which grants a 15-year license to Meter Asset Providers (MAP) to help the 11 Distribution Companies (DisCos) speed up meter installations for their customers. The regulation says the affected officials should not hold directorships and senior management positions in MAP. It however, remains unclear how the commission will monitor the management positions after it has cleared a MAP and issued it with a permit. 
The MAP Regulations 2018, will not be enforced until April 3, 2018, a document showed. Key features of the regulation, include the introduction of the “Metering Service Charge” for metered customers, barring of DisCos from owning or managing MAP firms, a 30 per cent local content mandate and the need to see more meters rolled out after the next four months (from July 2018).
