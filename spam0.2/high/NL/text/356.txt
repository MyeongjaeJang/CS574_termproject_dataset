The Department of Human Services (DHS) in Philadelphia have cut ties with two religious foster care agencies after learning they discriminate against LGBT+ couples. The decision comes after an expose from the Philadelphia Inquirer found that these organisations refused to place children with gay couples, despite receiving a combined $3 million in funding from the city. 
Religious organisations in Pennsylvania are not protected by religious freedom laws, like in other states, so the Philadelphia DHS has full reign to cut funding. On Thursday, the DHS ceased all foster-care intake with Bethany Christian Services and Catholic Social Services, pending an investigation. This will not affect children already placed only new placements going forward. 
“Our goal is to minimize placement disruptions,” said a DHS spokesperson, “and to ensure that a child’s ability to reunify with their family of origin or to continue an adoption process is not delayed because of a placement disruption.” 
Bethany Christian has faced controversy before and is currently fighting a discrimination lawsuit in Michigan.
