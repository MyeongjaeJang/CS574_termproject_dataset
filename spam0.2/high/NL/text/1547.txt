Google expands in Taiwan, with plans to hire more employees, train AI engineers Wednesday 21 March 2018 | 09:38 CET | News Google said it is planning to invest in Taiwan, after starting its first office there in 2006. Since then it has grown its team to over 2,000 people, built a data centre and opened a Google Cloud region. It also recently completed its acquisition of HTC staff and assets for USD 1.1 billion , with the goal of expanding in the APAC region. The company now plans to add more than 300 people to its team, provide digital marketing training to over 50,000 businesses and students, and train more than 5,000 Taiwanese students in artificial intelligence (AI) programing. 
Many of the new hires will be engineers working on hardware and software. The training of the businesses and students will take place under Google’s Digital Garage programme. There will be a free platform for digital marketing training, with offline facilities soon to be opened in Tainan and Taichung for a more personable contact. 
Regarding the AI training, Google will hold a train-the-trainers programme for teachers in locations across Taiwan with the company’s Machine Learning Crash Course initiative. The goal is to educate 5,000 students this year, and more in the coming years. Free Headlines in your E-mail
