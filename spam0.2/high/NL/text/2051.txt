Acta Marine’s new built Ulstein SX195 walk to work vessel has completed sea trials. 
Ulstein said on Wednesday that the vessel Acta Auriga, currently under construction at Ulstein Verft, completed sea trials last week. 
To remind, the hull of the Acta Auriga arrived in Norway for the final construction phase back in November 2017 . 
The walk-to-work vessel is custom-designed for the offshore energy industry. It is fitted with a 3D crane, SMST gangway and elevator tower, and the X-Bow and X-Stern design solutions and can accommodate 120 persons. 
As part of the sea trials the vessel was tested at maximum forward and backward speed. The aftward speed exceeded 12.5 knots while the registered speed in forward mode exceeded 13.5 knots. 
The noise and vibration level tests proved to be well within the limits of the high comfort class of the vessel. 
The centrally positioned walk to work motion compensated gangway and elevator tower for personnel and cargo transfers, and the 3D compensated crane capable of six-ton cargo lifts were also installed and commissioned. 
Ulstein added on Wednesday that the vessel returned to the construction yard for completion before delivery to Acta Marine. 
Upon delivery, the Acta Auriga will join its semi-sister vessel, Acta Orion. This will be the second vessel in the fleet which is, according to Acta, dedicated for walk to work, offshore logistics, and accommodation services for a variety of clients in the offshore energy industry and offshore renewables. 
It is worth noting that the vessels first charter will be for operations and maintenance work at the BARD Offshore 1 wind farm in Germany. Share this article
