B, opened last March 17, 2018. This is the company’s second authorized store and follows Xiaomi’s aggressive attempt to make their products, which range from smartphones and shoes to rice cookers and laptops, more accessible. Xiaomi has been busy, opening their first authorized store at Trinoma (last February 17), launching their Lazada store , and announcing the Redmi 5A and 5 Plus , all within the last three months. Xiaomi’s official presence vanished in 2016, leaving Mi fans to purchase Mi phones via non-official channels. Xiaomi will open their official store at Shopee this month.
