GTT attracts USD 175 mln funding following Interoute buy   08:42 CET | News 
US-based GTT Communications announced that it attracted USD 175 million in funding from a group of investors led by Aleph Capital Partners and Crestview Partners at the closing of its EUR 1.9 billion acquisition of European operator Interoute . Aleph and Crestview are existing shareholders of Interoute, and they will invest a portion of their proceeds from the sale of the data centre operator into the combined company, said GTT, adding that the equity commitment will reduce the amount of debt it needs to issue to fund the acquisition on a dollar-for-dollar basis. 
GTT announced the takeover of Interoute last month, giving it over 400 new points of presence, spanning 24 metro areas and interconnecting 126 cities across 29 countries. The company will also gain 15 data centres, 17 virtual data centres and 51 colocation facilities, as well as expertise in SD-WAN and cloud networking services.
