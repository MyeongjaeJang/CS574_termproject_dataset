TalkTalk ultrafast broadband head moves to Virgin Media - report   10:45 CET | News 
TalkTalk's head of ultrafast broadband, Richard Sinclair, is set to leave the company in the coming months to join rival Virgin Media as executive director of connectivity, reports the Financial Times. 
Sinclair joined TalkTalk after the 2012 London Olympics and has led the company's full-fibre network investment in York with CityFibre and Sky. His departure comes as TalkTalk is close to finalising a formal agreement with infrastructure investor Infracapital to establish a JV company to roll out full fibre to 3 million homes and businesses in medium-sized towns and cities across the UK. 
Infracapital has also recently made an GBP 270 million takeover offer for rural fibre broadband provider Gigaclear. If this takeover is approved, Gigaclear would be kept separate from the JV with TalkTalk.
