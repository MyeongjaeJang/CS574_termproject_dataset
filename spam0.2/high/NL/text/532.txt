Online goods delivery service Picnic is expanding its formula in Germany, centering on the Düsseldorf area, online news service Nu.nl reported on Monday. 
Picnic, which received a €100m capital injection from four large investment funds earlier this year, is expanding in both the Netherlands and Germany on a city-to-city basis. Picnic’s free deliveries are made by ‘runners’ driving small electric delivery vans which have set routes in each area of a town it serves. 
The company started up in 2015 in Amersfoort and is the brainchild of four investors including serial start-up businessman Michiel Muller who earlier set up the unstaffed petrol stations chain Tango. 
In the Netherlands, Picnic is now active in Amersfoort, Almere, Utrecht, Rotterdam, Leiden, Delft and The Hague. Eventually it plans to cover the entire country. The company is working closely with online department store Wehkamp in developing distribution centres and delivery services. Features
