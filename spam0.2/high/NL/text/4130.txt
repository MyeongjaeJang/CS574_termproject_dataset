TM Forum, Linux Foundation enter partnership on telecom open source projects   10:22 CET | News 
TM Forum entered into a partnership with The Linux Foundation to accelerate communications service providers’ adoption of new technology in open source projects and make possible the creation of an industry marketplace of compatible open source and commercial applications. Under the terms of the agreement, TM Forum and The Linux Foundation will work together to realise the commercial deployment of open source software within industry standard architectures. 
The collaboration will enable open source projects to be implemented according to platform-agnostic industry standards, thereby accelerating time to market and reducing the need for expensive customisation . This will be achieved through the adoption of TM Forum’s Open APIs within open source projects, providing standardised interworking with other systems. As part of TM Forum’s Open Digital Architecture, these APIs will speed up the deployment of open source software both within CSPs and also across broader ecosystems, supporting greater agility for a CSP’s existing operations as well as enabling new business models with ecosystem partners. 
TM Forum’s suite of over 50 REST-based Open APIs are used by more than 4,000 software developers in over 700 companies worldwide. 
As part of the partnership agreement, TM Forum introduced licensing of its Open APIs under Apache 2.0 License terms and conditions, allowing the APIs to be shared across the entire Linux Foundation community for use in any of its open source projects. 
Applications of TM Forum’s Open APIs and Open Digital Architecture will be demonstrated to more than 3,000 global telco IT leaders at the Forum’s annual Digital Transformation World conference in Nice, 14-16 May, by more than 100 TM Forum member companies participating in collaborative proof of concept ‘Catalyst’ projects.
