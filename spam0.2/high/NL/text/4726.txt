Canal Digitaal to end online geoblocking from April   10:54 CET | News 
Dutch satellite TV provider Canal Digitaal announced that geographic restrictions on viewing its TV services online in the EU will end from 01 April. As a result, customers can watch their subscribed channels online while travelling in the EU, reported TotaalTV. 
The change is the result of new EU rules on geoblocking. KPN, Ziggo and NLziet earlier announced that they would also allow access to their TV services online from April throughout the EU. 
Canal Digitaal Live TV is available over computers or mobile apps.
