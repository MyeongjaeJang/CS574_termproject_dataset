Tessa Thompson has secured yet another role under her belt. This time she’ll be starring in the spinoff to the classic trilogy “Men in Black.” 
According to The Hollywood Reporter, Thompson will reportedly star alongside her “Thor: Ragnarok” co-star, Chris Hemsworth, for the Sony reboot. 
Opposed to recreating the storyline we are all familiar with, the reboot will reportedly feature new characters, rather than Agents K and J, who were originally played by Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. 
F. Gary Gray, who is known for directing films, such as “Fate of the Furious,” and “Straight Outta Compton,” will come on board to direct, with a scheduled release date set for June 14, 2019. 
Thompson is currently filming the sequel of the 2015 film “Creed,” along with Michael B. Jordan. Last month it was announced she will star as famed jewel thief Doris Payne in an upcoming biopic.
