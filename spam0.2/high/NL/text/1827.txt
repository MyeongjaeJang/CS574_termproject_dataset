Hulu is signing a first-look animation deal with former Viceland and Adult Swim head of development Nick Weidenfeld. 
Weidenfeld will develop and executive produce animated projects for Hulu, which is looking to further its impact in the adult animation space. The pair have a non-exclusive deal. 
The exec most recently worked as Viceland’s president of programming, where he oversaw the development of original programming for series such as What Would Diplo Do . 
He began his career at Cartoon Network, where he developed popular adult animations such as The Boondocks and Robot Chicken for the Adult Swim programming block. 
The move follows a string of investments from streaming services into adult animation, with Netflix and Amazon investing in toons from the BoJack Horseman team and Apple bringing in a new animated series from Bob’s Burgers creator Loren Bouchard. 
Meanwhile, the future of popular adult toon Rick and Morty hangs in the balance as a network is yet to bite on its fourth season.
