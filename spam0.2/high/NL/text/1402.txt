NRA Propaganda Mistress Dana Loesch(bag): The NRA Are Parkland Victims Too Oh, Dana. It's not a fellowship. It's a death cult you evil b . Will Kohler 3 days ago 0 24 Less than a minute 
“It [the Parkland massacre] cost peoples lives and it also contributed to a state of poison in our national discourse where you have politicians and celebrities and everyone else impugning the characters of millions of law abiding members just because they choose to voluntarily enter into a fellowship and call themselves the NRA. That’s the problem here, it created even more victims of a different sort.” – NRA spokes-bitch Dana Loesch , speaking last night on NRA TV. 
Yes just like the Nazis were victims in WW2.
