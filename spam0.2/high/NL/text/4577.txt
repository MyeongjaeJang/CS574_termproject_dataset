Quentin Martin joins Luckbox as COO London, U.K. – WEBWIRE – Monday, March 26, 2018 
Luckbox, an innovative eSports betting organization operated by a team with vast experience in iGaming, e-sports and cryptocurrency is delighted to welcome Quentin Martin, duly appointed to the role of Chief Operating Officer (COO). Quentin will spearhead a major position in scaling up Luckbox operations as the enterprise concludes its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and prepares for launch later this year. Quentin holds vast experience in the gambling sector, serving formerly as Head of Social Poker at PokerStars, where he previously collaborated with Luckbox cofounders Lars Lien and Mike Stevens. Luckbox is an innovative start-up aiming to become a global leader in eSports betting. With a strong focus on integrity, the Isle of Man-based company will comply with top-tier licences to help bring credibility and trustworthiness to the esports betting space. Quentin, who recently completed an executive MBA (Master of Business Administration) at Warwick Business School, will work in the coming weeks to build upon the dynamic infrastructure of the Luckbox brand, including driving recruitment and putting in place the tools needed to take Luckbox to the next level. Quentin stated: As a scale-up COO, my role is incredibly flexible and tough to define - essentially, everything that isnt product, marketing, or finance falls under my purview, one of which Im honoured to undertake. Im here to enhance the organisation and to make sure we stay on track operationally. The job description could most accurately be described as get things done! With eSports revenues forecast to be worth $1.6bn by 2021, Luckbox is aiming to be part of the rapid growth of the industry - while exuding unparalleled professionalism and a willingness to comply with regulation. Quentin added: First and foremost, Im a gamer - I played Magic the Gathering and poker professionally for almost a decade - highlights involve being the UKs #1 player and representing the UK and Canada at various world championships. Sadly, I just missed the eSports boom, although still managed to find early success winning the Italian Unreal Tournament Nationals as well as producing early online mentoring and content for Magic. The fast-paced and highly analytical environment of games lent itself perfectly to the frenetic arena of business and after starting up PSW Ventures - a luxury eCommerce site - I found my way into product management and then general leadership at PokerStars, most recently responsible for their free-to-play games. The product-market fit is perfect - eSports, eSports betting, and crypto are all just past their tipping points and primed for massive growth; a gamble easily worth taking. The existing competition can be put in two camps - either theyre existing betting operators or theyre unregulated eSports betting sites; by being eSports first, by in truth being a part of the eSports community, Luckbox has an edge on the former camp and by being fully regulatory compliant, with our focus on responsible gaming, we have the edge yet again on the latter. Luckbox is subsequently perfectly poised to create something big and Im excited to be on board early and be a part of shaping our future. https://luckbox.com/ Luckbox is an innovative eSports betting start-up operated by a team with vast experience in iGaming, e-sports and cryptocurrency.
