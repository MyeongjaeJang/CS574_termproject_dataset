According to a March 22 press release on the Liberty Counsel hate group website, the Girl Scouts of the USA is the largest member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), which the Liberty Counsel claims, “aggressively promotes abortion and promiscuous sex” and takes exception to WAGGGS’ support of comprehensive sex-ed for all young people, its memberships in organizations like Planned Parenthood and the Coalition for Adolescent Girls and its support of the women’s marches, which the Liberty Counsel calls “a vulgar and profanity-laden event that clearly stated ‘safe, legal, and affordable abortion and birth control for all people’ among its core principles.” 
Liberty Counsel President and Shyster Mathew “Mat” Staver stated in the press release: 
The once great Girl Scouts USA took a tragic fall when it became a political advocacy group that promotes abortion and sexual promiscuity to innocent girls. It’s important that people understand that the profits from cookie sales go toward harming young girls rather that helping them. 
In addition, all Girl Scout councils sell GSUSA’s official curriculum series for girl members, which promotes prominent pro-abortion women and organizations, including Gloria Steinem , Betty Friedan , the American Civil Liberties Union , the Population Council and many others . A list of speeches by “ Eloquent Women “ is provided to assist the girls with their public speaking badge. Recommendations include Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger’s speech advocating for a women’s right to birth control, Lady Gaga and Sally Field both advocating for same-sex “marriage.” 
Staver has also bashed the Boy Scouts, claiming in 2015 that allowing gay members and Scout leaders in the Boy Scouts will create a “playground for pedophiles.”
