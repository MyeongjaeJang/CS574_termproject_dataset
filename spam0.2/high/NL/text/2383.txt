Cuba's state-owned telecommunications operator Etecsa intends to install some 52,000 Nauta Hogar home internet connections this year, reports Efe, citing the company’s executive president Mayra Arevich. The residential internet service has so far been set up in 27,300 homes after an initial trial was carried out in parts of Havana last year. Etecsa’s other plans for this year including launching a further 150 Wi-Fi access points in public spaces to bring the total to 1,550 throughout the island, and expanding 2G and 3G mobile internet connectivity to at least half the country.
