Huawei Marine launches Phase II of Philippines' Grid Project   08:54 CET | News Huawei Marine has announced the launch of Phase II of its Sorsogon-Samar Submarine Fiber Optical Interconnection Project (SSSFOIP) for the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP). The SSSFOIP system is located in the San Bernardino Strait, linking Sorsogon, the southernmost province on Luzon to the island of Samar. 
The power transmission network between Sorsogon and Samar was built in 1997 and is a key branch of the Philippinesâ€™ power grid. According to Huawei, the current microwave service requires upgrading due to its limited bandwidth and vulnerability to weather conditions. The NGCP held a public tender in 2016 to invest in building a new cable system to enhance branch network data exchange capabilities to meet the increasing bandwidth demand and enhance management level of the national grid. 
The SSSFOIP submarine cable project was tendered in two phases, both of which were awarded to Huawei Marine. The first phase survey was completed in 2016. Phase II features a submarine cable with a 12.8 Tbps design capacity that will be completed in the third quarter of this year. The system will adopt a HA (Heavy Armor) submarine cable.
