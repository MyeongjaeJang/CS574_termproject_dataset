Italian Carrera won the race for the Russian Premier League (RPL) title last year, bringing Spartak their first league title in 16 years. Loyal Spartak fans clearly wanted to show their high opinion of the managerial maestro by trying to vote him as Russian president as well. 
Carrera came to Spartak in the summer of 2016, having previously been second in command to current Chelsea boss Antonio Conte at Juventus and Italy, capturing the Russian title at the first attempt.
