Skylines switch off as people connect to the planet for Earth Hour 2018 SINGAPORE – WEBWIRE – Thursday, March 22, 2018 
On Saturday 24 March 8:30 p.m. local time, skylines around the world will go dark as millions celebrate WWFs Earth Hour to spark global awareness and action on nature and the environment. 
From the Eiffel Tower to the Empire State Building, and the Birds Nest stadium to Burj Khalifa, thousands of landmarks will switch off their lights in solidarity for the planet, urging individuals, businesses and governments worldwide to move forward the conversations and solutions we need to build a healthy, sustainable future for all. 
For the first time, in addition to participating in the global switch-off, WWF is inviting people across the globe to connect2earth to share and talk about what nature means to them, in the places they live in and care about. As the planet faces the dual challenge of climate change and staggering loss of nature, the worlds largest grassroots movement for the environment aims to mobilize unprecedented global action on biodiversity and nature by kick-starting global conversations on issues such as healthy forests, plastic-free oceans and wildlife conservation. 
Nature is in alarming decline. Halting its loss is urgent and crucial as much as tackling climate change, said Marco Lambertini, Director General, WWF International. Biodiversity and nature is the foundation of life, essential to our wellbeing. Yet, we continue to take nature for granted while our actions are pushing it to the brink. This Earth Hour, we want to shine a light on the importance of biodiversity and nature. Together, as individuals, businesses and governments, we must show the same determination to halt biodiversity and nature loss as we have shown on climate action to secure a healthy, thriving and living planet for all.
