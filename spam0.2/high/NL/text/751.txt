/ Posted on 20 March, 2018 10:58 Airbnb says absence of long-term contracts among the merits of listing on its platform rather than OTAs 
Having declared its intentions to be ‘for everyone’ , Airbnb last week penned an open letter to “boutique hotels and B&B owners”, touting its lower fees compared to hefty commissions charged by OTAs. 
“Time and again, small business owners told us that the fees charged by travel agents like Expedia and Booking – which can be as high as 30 percent – are too high,” the home-sharing giant wrote in the letter.

“We want Airbnb to be for everyone, including professional hospitality providers that offer unique spaces and personal hospitality to the Airbnb community.” 
Besides lower commissions fees, the absence of long-term contracts allows independent hoteliers to “have full control over when (their) inventory appears on Airbnb” and need not compete against big chain hotels on the platform, it claimed. 
Airbnb said the addition of four property types – Vacation Home, Unique Space, B&B and Boutique – will enable hosts to better classify their accommodation better and attract Airbnb users. 
It also hinted that a new guest membership programme, slated for a roll-out later this year, will help hospitality providers better manage their inventory. TAGS
