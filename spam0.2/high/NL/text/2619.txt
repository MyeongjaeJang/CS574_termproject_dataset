Telefonica trialling 600Mbps, IPv6 service in Madrid - report   15:34 CET | News 
Telefonica has launched a trial of its forthcoming 600Mbps fibre service in Madrid, reports website vozpopuli.com. The pilot is being run in the homes of customers and non-customers signed up to the Movistar Zona Beta testing service in several streets in the centre of the capital, said the report, adding that the operator is also trialling IPv6 technology ahead of its implementation throughout the country. 
If the tests are successful, Telefonica will proceed to double the current symmetric maximum fibre speed of 300Mbps to 600Mbps for Movistar Fusion subscribers, as promised when it hiked prices earlier this year. Free Headlines in your E-mail
