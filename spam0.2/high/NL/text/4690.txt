Rakuten to use Kansai Electric Power infra for MNO base stations   10:10 CET | News Japanese e-commerce site operator Rakuten has decided to use the transmission towers, utility poles, telecommunication towers and other infrastructure of The Kansai Electric Power. Rakuten has applied to Japan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications for frequency band allocation for 4G (1.7 GHz band and 3.4 GHz band) services with the aim of entering the MNO business. If Rakuten’s frequency band allocation is granted, the company plans to use Kansai Electric Power’s transmission towers, utility poles, telecommunication towers and other infrastructure in and around Japan’s Kansai region for its base station locations. 
Rakuten is looking to invest in base station infrastructure and will consider collaborations with other electric utilities to achieve Japan-wide service coverage, as it prepares for entry into the MNO business subject to approval of its frequency band allocation application at the end of March.
