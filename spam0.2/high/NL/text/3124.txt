German ministers order meeting with Facebook reps over data scandal   13:46 CET | News 
German politicians have expressed doubts over Facebook’s announcement earlier this week to strengthen its data protection policies in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, reported Heise Online. German Federal Data Protection Commissioner Andrea Vosshoff told German newswire dpa that she was skeptical of Facebook’s change of course given that Facebook’s business model revolves around generating and then “profitably marketing” data, wrote Heise. Still, the company could submit proof of these changes in its policies, she added. 
Germany’s Minister for Justice and Consumer Protection Katarina Barley likewise called the revelations that data on over 50 million Facebook users was leaked to Cambridge Analytica an “enormous scandal” in the German parliament this week. Barley invited the heads of Facebook in Europe for a meeting at the ministry in the coming weeks to discuss what lead to this event, whether German users were affected and what Facebook plans to do to prevent similar occurrences from happening again. She also stressed that Facebook would be liable for fines of up to EUR 40 billion for violating the EU’s new data protection regime (GDPR) after it enters into effect this May.
