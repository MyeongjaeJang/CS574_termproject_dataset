The Communications Workers of America (CWA) announced that 1,400 member workers in West Virginia and Ashburn (Virginia) are set to return to work by 28 March after reaching a contract agreement with the operator following a strike that commenced on 04 March. The strike was called after 10 months of negotiations and no agreement on a fair contract, with the workersâ€™ union accusing Frontier of cutting over 500 middle-class jobs and neglecting the network in West Virginia after acquiring Verizon's landlines in the state back in 2010.
