Toshiba memory chip sale delayed by regulators   08:54 CET | News 
Toshiba said it's still awaiting regulatory clearance from China on the planned sale of its memory chip business. The company said it still hopes to close the deal by the end of March. 
The company agreed last September to sell the business to the Pangea consortium led by Bain Capital. However, it has yet to receive all the necessary regulatory clearances for the sale. Toshiba said the conditions of the sale could be waived in order to close the deal still before 30 March and it aims to reach an agreement as soon as possible.
