Deutsche Telekom to phase out pre-installed apps on branded smartphones   14:02 CET | News Deutsche Telekom has announced that it will no longer require customers to use pre-installed Telekom applications and modified firmware on Telekom-brand Android smartphones, reported OnlineKosten.de. 
The company said it would no longer modify firmware from smartphone manufacturers like Samsung, Huawei, Sony, LG or HTC and do away with pre-installed applications that users cannot delete later on. Instead, customers will be able to choose to install certain Telekom applications during the initial configuration of their smartphone. The changes will allow users to better customize their smartphones according to their individual needs, receive software updates faster and free up more storage space on their device for other apps.
