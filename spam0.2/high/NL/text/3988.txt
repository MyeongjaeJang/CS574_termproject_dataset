Wire Service Jonah Ghartey Pens and Illustrates A Book about Self-examination in the Christian World The thought-provoking book Examine Yourself exhorts readers to examine themselves everyday so that the enemies wrath could not topple them down and erase their Christian faith. Round Rock, Texas – WEBWIRE – Friday, March 23, 2018 
Corinthians 13:5 Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?unless indeed you fail to meet the test! 
No one has the right to tell someone if he/she is a full-pledged Christian or not. No one has the right to underestimate ones faith in God. Anyone who professes to be a Christian can only gauge for him/herself and know where he/she stand in this world. The enemy continues to deceive Christians that they are not worth to be one because of such evil deeds done in the past. Through self-examination, one can answer the test of faith. This book is recommended to all individuals who have a lot of unanswered questions in their hearts and mind. Examine Yourself  will be one of the many inspirational books readers will find displayed in the upcoming 2018 New York Rights Fair which will take place on March 30, 2018.
