Dogs and Other Critters Poetic Expressions Poetry unleashing creative communication of life lessons through dogs and other critters Culver City, California – WEBWIRE – Monday, March 19, 2018 
Relating with various animals  tame or wild, fierce or mild, big or small, short or tallmakes for a delightful, hilarious poetry reading of  Going to the Dogs and Other Critters , written for children and parents. Dr. Janet Hoult takes readers on an exploration of animal wisdom and wonder, triggering memories and a special yearning for animals, great or small. Her book is deeply heartwarming, in the same vein as the Readers Favorite Awardee, Where Did the Sun Go? Myths and Legends of Solar Eclipse around the World  (2013), and Body Parts: A Collection of Poems about AgingHumorous Poems Written from Life Experiences (2010). Mentored by life, she finds poetry over prose as a better avenue for expression in coping with loss and sourcing support for a cause. Going to the Dogs and Other Critters brings lovers of animals and poetry together. Going to the Dogs and Other Critters Written by Janet Cameron Hoult and illustrated by Mick Beyer Kindle | $9.99
