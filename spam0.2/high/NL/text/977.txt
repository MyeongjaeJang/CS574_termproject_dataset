The East African regional bloc IGAD has reiterated its call on parties in the South Sudan conflict to stop violating the ceasefire signed last year, its council of ministers said on Tuesday. 
The council, in a statement extended to Radio Tamazuj, is dismayed to learn that in some parts of the country the violations of the agreement continued with impunity. 
“The IGAD Council of Ministers (CoM) recalls its statement of 25th January 2018 titled “Statement on The Reports of Violations of Cessation of Hostilities Agreement in the Republic of South Sudan”, regarding serious violations of cessation of Hostilities Agreement (COHA) which called on the Government of South Sudan and SPLM-IO (RM) to undertake the necessary investigation and ensure accountability of Violators,” the statement reads in part. 
The council also recalled its demand on the parties to provide information of the responsible individuals to CTSAMM within one month from the issuance of the 25th January, 2018 statement. 
However, the council noted with regrets that no party has submitted its report to CTSAMM as of the issuance of the statement. 
“The failure to comply with the duty to investigate and report the accountability measures taken against perpetrators of violations of the COHA can be considered as non-compliance to Article 13 of the COHA,” the council said. 
The Council of Ministers, once again, called on all the Parties to the conflict to fully observe their obligation under the ceasefire agreement. Share this
