The Cargo Workers Union of Red Sea state have renewed their objections to the Wali’s decision to set-up private companies for loading and unloading ships in Port Sudan. 
On Thursday, the head of the stevedores, Ashbadin Ahmed Hamror told Radio Dabanga from Port Sudan that the companies proposed by the Wali will lay-off 21,000 workers in the port. 
He argues that “the current workers have managed to attract huge investments of agricultural projects and hotels. 
“The government aims at establishing companies to dominate those investments and the workers' earnings,” Hamror said, and called on all workers to oppose them. 
He explained that those workers who support the ruling National Congress Party have vowed to disengage from the Party in the event that the state government proceeds with the establishment of the companies. 
Protests 
In February, the Alternative Port Workers Union accused the Ministry of Transport of lack of transparency and continuing privatisation procedures in spite of the repeated denials by the Minister of Transport” and threatened to organise demonstrations and sit-ins in protest against the continuation of the privatisation procedures of Port Sudan.
