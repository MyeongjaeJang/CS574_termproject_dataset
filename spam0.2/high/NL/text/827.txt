 Boxships Crash into Each Other in Karachi Port Youtube Screenshot Two Post Panamax containerships collided in the Karachi port in Pakistan on Monday, March 19, sending over a dozen of containers overboard.
A video released by local media shows Hapag-Lloyd’s 8,063 TEU Tolten brush against 6,350 TEU Hamburg Bay which was already berthed at the South Asia Port Terminal.
Several containers tumbled down from the boxship and went into the water as the ship struggled to maneuver into the terminal.
It appears that the two ships did not sustain serious damage, however, an official estimate is yet to be provided.
There have been no injuries reported to the crew so far.
The terminal suspended operations for several hours after the incident, according to Geo News.
“ Our ship the Tolten rammed another ship while berthing in Karachi on Monday. We deeply regret that this incident occurred. We have ascertained on-site that no one was injured as a result of the incident, and that there has been absolutely no environmental pollution,” German liner company Hapag-Lloyd told World Maritime News in a statement.
The reason behind the collision is not known and an investigation into the incident is said to be underway.
“There is yet to be a definitive explanation for this incident. We will conduct an in-depth investigation of the incident, and are working as hard as we can to get the vessel back on its way as quickly as possible,” the company said.
