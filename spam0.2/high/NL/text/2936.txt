Ben Cohen & Bluebuck Underwear Team Up For Smokin’ Hot Realness (Photos) C July 3, 2012 1 8 Less than a minute 
As we previously posted , rugby hunk and straight ally, Ben Cohen and his StandUp foundation, have teamed up with Bluebuck underwear to release a limited edition line of mens underwear. Well, Bluebuck has taken to their Facebook page to post some more tantalizing pictures of the former rugger. I for one am cheering Ben’s commitment to fighting homophobia in sports. From Ben Cohen: 
“We are looking to affect the next generation. We want to create cultural change and we are doing that by using our StandUp brand to communicate that it is not cool to bully, but it is cool to stand up.” Share this:
