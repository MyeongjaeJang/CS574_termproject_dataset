Vivendi subsidiary launches FTTH service in Togo's capital   17:49 CET | News 
Vivendi's subsidiary GVA (Group Vivendi Africa) announced the launch of the Canalbox fibre offering in Togo’s capital Lome. The company said that the FTTH service is available in several areas of the city and will gradually be deployed to new locations over time. 
Alongside Teolis, GVA was one of two winners of a broadband access provider licence in mid-2017. Teolis entered Togo’s mobile broadband market in January, initially targeting business customers. With the arrival of two new operators in the country, Togocel recently announced plans to launch LTE services in Lome at the end of April. 
Togo is the second African country where GVA has deployed its own fibre access network. In October 2017, the company unveiled its first Canalbox commercial offers in Gabon’s capital Libreville. Free Headlines in your E-mail
