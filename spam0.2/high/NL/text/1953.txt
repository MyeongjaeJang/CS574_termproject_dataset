Notes on Cambridge Analytica, Data Privacy, and Photos of Your Toast CovFeFe 1 min ago Google+ VKontakte Telegram Viber 
One. If you ever once thought a shred of your personal data on Facebook was private, or not being bought and sold as a commodity, you haven’t been paying attention. We exchange our data for convenience, access, and discounts on the daily. If a big corporation gives you its product for “free” —  you are the product. (That’s not new: see “all of U.S. television except PBS ”.) 
Two. Technology is an amoral chameleon — it changes colors based on how we use it and how we abuse it. If you’re using Facebook to share angry rants about Trump , you’re still using social media to spread hate no matter what side you’re on (and you’re playing into his tiny, tiny hands.) ← case in point. Anger is destructive. Stop taking the bait . Be proactive, not reactive. 
Three. Keep the outrage and spotlight directed at Big Money on * both* sides of the aisle. Yes, we Democrats buy data and deploy psychographics, too. (See: Obama campaign .)That doesn’t mean Facebook shouldn’t be held accountable for their gross inaction and lack of due diligence, but focusing anger and attention on FB as if it’s the problem is a magician’s misdirection. 
Four. Social media is the most powerful tool for the democratization of communications since the printing press. If you’re not using it to organize people, to spread positive ideas, and to seek good information from verified sources, you’re wasting its true power. We all love a good food shot — guilty as charged — but keep it in check and eat your avocado toast before it gets cold.
