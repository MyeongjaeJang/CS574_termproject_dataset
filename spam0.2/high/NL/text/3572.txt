DMX will find out how much time he will have to spend in the slammer next week, and federal prosecutors are hoping to send the rapper away for 5 years! 
According to TMZ, prosecutors want him to serve the maximum penalty for his tax evasion case because they want to prove a point that no one gets off the hook, celebrity or not. 
The site also reported that he’s feeling good about his case. Since his case he’s already been in and out of jail for failing a drug test so prosecutors want to really make him do some serious time.
