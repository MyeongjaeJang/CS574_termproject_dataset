The Bears were able to keep their interest in quarterback Mitchell Trubisky quiet entering the 2017 NFL Draft. 
That won’t be the case with the highest-rated defensive end in the 2018 draft class. 
A source told Sporting News that North Carolina State’s Bradley Chubb is meeting Wednesday night with Bears officials as part of a predraft visit. 
MOCK DRAFT: Colts beat Bears to Chubb 
Chicago’s diligence makes sense: The Bears are in need of a pass rusher to pair with Leonard Floyd. The 6-4, 269-pound Chubb is considered the top prospect at his position after registering 10 sacks and 26 tackles for losses during a stellar 2017 season. 
If the Bears do want Chubb, they may need to jump up from their current No. 8 slot in the first round because other teams who pick earlier could be feeling the same way. The Colts (No. 6) and Buccaneers (No. 7) finished 31st and 32nd, respectively, in the NFL in sacks last season. It also wouldn’t be a head-scratcher if the Browns (No. 4) or Broncos (No. 5) went that route because Chubb plays a premium position.
