New Halfa traders ‘harassed by authorities’ March 22 - 2018 NEW HALFA File photo 
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the locality of New Halfa of Kassala state in eastern Sudan launched an intense campaign of seizure and confiscation on the shops of vendors of mobile phones, vegetables, and dry goods on the pretext of irregularities. 
A vendor told Radio Dabanga that for years he has made a living and supported his family by trading dry goods ( nawashif ) and denounced the authorities' repeated confiscation of their goods without prior warning. 
He explained that the localities have been carrying out campaigns without providing the necessary alternatives for the vendors. 
He expressed surprise that the authorities prohibit the mobile phone vendors from displaying their mobile phones outside their shops, pointing to the difficulty of implementing that decision and the material losses caused by the confiscations.
