Huawei to launch cloud services in sub-Saharan Africa, starting with SA  17 CET | News Huawei will launch its mobile consumer-facing cloud services in South Africa, reports Mybroadband. Huawei has established regional centres in Germany, Singapore, and China to support its mobile cloud services across 200 countries. By providing mobile cloud services in South Africa, Huawei plans to improve its service offering and deliver an integrated product to consumers consisting of chipset, cloud, and hardware-powered features. 
Huawei will initially roll out support for six cloud-based mobile apps in South Africa and continue to expand this offering. Huawei said it is in partnership discussions with local companies to improve the localisation of the content available on its cloud platform. 
Cloud services in South Africa will be provided by the company’s Singapore data centre and will support all existing Huawei devices. The company told MyBroadband that if the adoption of mobile cloud services in South Africa grows quickly, the company will consider implementing a data hub in the country to service local demand. Huawei’s mobile cloud services will roll out to the rest of sub-Saharan Africa following their local launch. Free Headlines in your E-mail
