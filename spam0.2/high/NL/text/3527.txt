Kozhikkode: In a bid to free itself from the Kannur bypass dispute, Kerala government has passed the buck to Centre. 
As BJP is supporting a section of CPM supporters engaged in the protest in Kannur, the move would put BJP directly against those opposing reclaiming of wetland for the bypass. 
PWD Minister G Sudhakaran sent a letter in this regard to Union Minister Nitin Gadkari and the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) chairman. 
The State Government could only acquire the required land for construction of the elevated highway. NHAI would have to build the elevated section, the minister said. 
The protest was started by Suresh under the title ‘Vayalkiligal’ (farm birds) in 2017. They were against reclaiming of paddy field for the Kannur bypass project. The protest was called off as the Government assured them that a different route would be taken. 
But the Government failed to keep its promise and finally issued notification to acquire land in Keezhatoor. The protest was started afresh and when the campaign began to grow strong, CPM men torched the shed set up by protesters. Twelve CPM men were arrested in this connection. ALSO READ
