Sky Italia in advanced talks with Open Fiber over broadband launch - report   09:48 CET | News 
Sky Italia is in advanced talks with the Open Fiber wholesale-only venture of Italian utility Enel and state lender CDP over the possibility of launching a fibre-based broadband service , reports La Repubblica. A deal would allow Sky to bundle its pay-TV content with a broadband service, as it already does in the UK, and stream its channels in HD and 4K thanks to the increased bandwidth offered by Open Fiberâ€™s network, said the report. In January Sky Italia announced that its customer base stood at 4.77 million at the end of December and that it intends to roll out Sky over fibre in Italy this year so that customers can access all its channels and on demand content over IP without a satellite dish. 
Open Fiber is currently building a wholesale fibre-optic network open to all operators in 250 large Italian cities, with the company targeting a total of 19 million households and businesses by 2022 in a total investment of some EUR 6.5 billion.
