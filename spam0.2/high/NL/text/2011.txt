Michael B Jordan will be throwing on his producing hat for an upcoming World War II film entitled “The Liberators.” 
According to Variety , Jordan will be producing through his Outlier Society Productions Company alongside Safehouse Pictures. 
It has not been determined whether or not he will star in the film, which is based on the spec script written by Madison Turner. 
According to the synopsis of the script, “The Liberators,” tell the story of “the 761st regiment in World War II, an entirely African-American combat unit whose heroism led to the desegregation of the armed forces.” 
Last week Warner Bros. finalized the deal for the script package after Safehouse brought the script over to Jordan’s production company. 
Most recently, Michael B. Jordan was starred in the box office hit “Black Panther,” and he is already working on the sequel to the 2015 film “Creed.”
