Wire Service ABB wireless security system creates a safe and comfortable home environment ABB enhances its smarter building portfolio with ABB-secure@home, offering protection both inside and outside the home, as well as safeguarding against fire and flooding. WEBWIRE – Tuesday, March 20, 2018 
ABB-secure@home is a new, user friendly intrusion and alarm system for residential properties, which integrates with ABBs existing home automation solution and door entry system. The system is fully accessible online via the MyBuildings portal, powered by ABB Ability, the companys cloud-based, industry-leading portfolio of digital solutions. Key features include a stylish, state-of-the-art design with an integrated capacitive backlit keypad and a simple to use interface with an intuitive configuration wizard. 
Working in tandem with ABB-free@homeŽ, the central unit can be used to manage and monitor all of a buildings safety and security functions, including setting and disabling the intrusion alarm, either with the ABB-WelcomeTouch panel or remotely via the MyBuildings portal, through a PC or mobile device. 
The ability to protect and keep your home safe, even when youre not there, is one of the most important functions of smart building automation, said Axel Kaiser, Global Product Manager of ABB Building Automation. Users can now access the same level of intelligent control for their security system as they can for their heating and lighting. Safety, lighting, blind control, thermoregulation and door entry are now part of a single intelligent and integrated system. 
ABB-secure@home is extremely easy to commission and control, even remotely. It blends seamlessly with existing technology to create a safe and comfortable home environment. 
The new wireless security system provides effective infrared detection both outside and inside the home as well as door and window monitoring. Security sensors can be split into pre-defined or customized zones and activated according to customer need, while the safety sensors monitor smoke or water leaks. It also uses the latest encrypted wireless technology with bi-directional communication allowing the system to maximize protection.
