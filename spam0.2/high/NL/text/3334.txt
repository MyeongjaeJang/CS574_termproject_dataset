Matt Bomer Buys Out Hometown Texas Movie Theater for the Community to See “Love, Simon” Love, Matt Will Kohler 1 day ago 0 35 Less than a minute Spring, Texas native, and openly gay actor Matt Bomer, has bought out a screening of the film Love, Simon so that people in his hometown can see the gay coming-of-age story. In an Instagram post Thursday , Bomer announced that he and his husband, Simon Halls, had bought out the 4 p.m. showing at the AMC Spring, Texas 10. 
Bomer, who made his stage debut at Houston’s Alley Theatre in 1995, grew up in a conservative Christian home and struggled to come out to his parents. 
One commenter called Bomer’s buyout “a beautiful gesture that will produce openness in the hearts and minds of those who will see this film.” 
“I know how much pain you have gone through in your adolescence and I hope that many guys in the future do not have to do the same,” the commenter wrote. 
Bomer will make his Broadway debut in “The Boys in the Band ,” a new revival of the landmark 1968 drama to be directed by Joe Mantello with a cast that includes Jim Parsons, Zachary Quinto and Andrew Rannells. Share this:
