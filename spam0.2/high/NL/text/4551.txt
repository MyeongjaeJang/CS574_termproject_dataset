Background: 
There is no one singular solution to be found for an organization to ''digitally transform'' itself. Rather, it is a multitude of disciplines and capabilities that must work holistically in order to achieve efficient and effective outcomes. From leadership and management strategies that embrace processes such as agile methodologies and open source development, to IT design and an enterprise infrastructure that is user-centric, innovative and fast. It takes an understanding of not only what are the current problems to be fixed, but what is actually trying to be achieved? The highly anticipated legislation to modernize the federal governmentâ€™s aging information technology infrastructure is now law with the passing of the Modernizing Government Technology Act. So now what? How will agencies move forward in their evolving digital transformation? What is the role that industry will and can play? What will this mean for their end-users, and how will this help improve their overarching mission? Join us in May to help answer these questions and learn about our Government's Senior Leader's path forward.
