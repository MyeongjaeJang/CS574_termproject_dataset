0 Jeezy fans, it looks like #TheSnowman is calling it quits after his next album! Young Jeezy took to Twitter to announce his next album will be his last saying: “As the Cold Summer tour comes to a end.. It was inspiring seeing my day one fans since my first album & class TM 101 come out every night. Now class is coming to a end. It’s time for Graduation! My Last Album & Final Class: TM104 -#TrustYaProcess,” It definitely feels like it’s an end of an era #Roommates. Unfortunately there are no other details as of now about the upcoming album or what he plans to do after retirement, but we definitely appreciate what Young Jeezy has done for the rap game!
