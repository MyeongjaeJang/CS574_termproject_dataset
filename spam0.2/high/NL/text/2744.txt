Golden Boy President rubbishes Canelo v Spike fight talk By Joe O'Neill   
Golden Boy President Eric Gomez has rubbished claims that there is a definitive plan for Spike O’Sullivan [27(19)-2(1)] to face Mexican superstar Canelo Alvarez in September. 
The Cork middleweight had revealed that , should he win his upcoming bout in Las Vegas on Friday May 4th, he would then face Canelo in September – regardless of his result in the middleweight title rematch with Gennady Golovkin. 
This was confirmed by O’Sullivan’s promoter , Ken Casey of Murphys Boxing, but Golden Boy have moved to cool the certainty surrounding the proposed bout – which was thought to be set for a casino in Vegas should Canelo lose to Golovkin, or a stadium in Texas should he defeat the Kazakh and claim the three world titles. 
When asked whether a Canelo-Spike fight was being planned for September, Gomez stated to Ring Magazine that it was “Wishful thinking.” Widgets Magazine 
“We will consider anyone at 160 pounds.” 
33-year-old O’Sullivan is currently one fight into a four-fight TV deal with Golden Boy, having scored a stunning upset knockout win over Antoine Douglas in Montreal in December. 
The Mahon man is currently awaiting confirmation of his next fight on May 4th, the night before Golovkin v Canelo 2 where the WBC, WBA, and IBF belts will be on the line. 
Whether there is a pre-existing roadmap or not, expect O’Sullivan to step up his chase for a fight with the Golden Boy poster boy in the build-up to their respective May bouts. 
Canelo [49(37)-1(0)-2] currently sits under a brewing storm after it was revealed earlier this month that he failed a drugs test, with traces of clenbuterol appearing in two of his samples. 
The failed tests were put down to contaminated Mexican beef and the fight with Golovkin looks set to proceed, however the champion has accused Canelo of cheating both here and in the build-up to their first meeting. Share this:
