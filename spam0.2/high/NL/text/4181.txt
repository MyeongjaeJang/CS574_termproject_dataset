The family of detained former South Sudanese rebel commander who is being held in Uganda has called on the relevant authorities to release him on health grounds. 
The Uganda People’s Defense Forces (UPDF) arrested Colonel John Data in Oroba area in September 2017, and accused him of recruiting Ugandan youth, an accusation Data’s group denies. 
Colonel Tata was among the SPLA-IO breakaway group that signed a peace agreement with the government of South Sudan’s Yei River State last year. 
His Mary Ajio told Radio Tamazuj today that the health condition of John Data is critical in Uganda’s Gulu military detention, calling on the relevant authorities to release her husband on health and humanitarian ground. 
Ajio said that the family has approached the government state for the release of her husband, but no positive response so far. 
She called on the state and national governments as well as the grassroots peace mediator, Bishop Elias Taban to intervene as soon as possible. 
“If any government representative or church leader could visit John Data in the Gulu prison, the prison officers may release him. My humble call is to the state governor Emmanuel Adil to intervene,” she appealed. 
Gulu prison officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Share this
