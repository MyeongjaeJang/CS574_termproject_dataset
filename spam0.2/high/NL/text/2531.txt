Toshiba has started a push to transform the company into a digital powerhouse, with a focus on the Internet of Things (IoT), digital simulation and security, as well as on the co-creation of systems. To achieve this goal, the company has created the new position of chief digital officer (CDO) and a new Digital Transformation Strategy Acceleration division. The new CDO will lead the division, which will start operating on 1 April. The new division will develop strategies on how Toshiba should transform and act as an incubator for the digitisation of the group and of its individual businesses. It will also design an IoT platform for group management and basically change Toshiba into a group of companies able to “maximize customer value through co-creation.” 
Specifically, Toshiba said it will reinforce Spinex, its IoT architecture, and promote businesses that can provide customers with cutting-edge digitisation capabilities. The new division will also create an ecosystem to encourage the emergence and expansion of new digital businesses, either by promoting open innovation at the global level or through business alliances and co-creation, to generate value with customers in industrial sectors, including social infrastructure and energy. 
Also, group unit Toshiba Digital Solutions Corporation (TDSL) will develop and operate system that use IoT and AI. Toshiba will also establish the Toshiba Digital & Consulting Corporation as a subsidiary of TDSL on 2 April, to help create value with clients in the fields of social infrastructure, energy and mobility.
