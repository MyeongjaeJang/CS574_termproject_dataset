Elisabeth also mentions this link on rootschat. 
One of the members states 
According to the Deaths at Sea returns for April 1918. He was a Fireman aboard the Hull registered vessel HARROGATE official number 132261 when she foundered 80 miles west by south of the Manstaf light (off the coast of Norway) whilst on a voyage Hull for Bergen with a cargo of Coke. His birthplace was given as IJmuiden, age 36 and he resided at 64 Warwick Street, Hull. 
For what its worth. I agree that Pieter Joch Appels in Hull, 1918 and the Peter John Appels who died 1918 were the same person. I believe the person mentioned in the Crew Agreements from Hull History Archive is also the same man. You could try looking at the original crew agreements to ascertain his age. This would prove or otherwise my theory. 
Unfortunately his birth in IJmuiden (Velsen) cannot be found. 
It's a very confusing topic indeed on rootschat (like this one, from the very start ) and I rest my case. Reageer

What is de name from your g. Grandmother 
Can you tell us what you have found in the marriage certificate. 
Elisabeth - 14 aug 2016 om 18:44 
Indeed a bit confusing. First an attempt to bring some known info together: 

UK Census 1911 
John Appels 32 (estimated birth 1879, Amsterdam). I understand that his full name was Peter John Appels and died in 1918 at sea? 
Jane Appels 26 (estimated birth 1885, Hull Yorkshire). I understand that her full name was Sarah Jane Donison ? 
Their children 
Marion 10 (estimated birth 1901, Hull Yorkshire), the grandmother of the person who posed the question? 
Emily 8 (estimated birth 1903) 
Peter 6 (estimated birth 1905, Hull Yorkshire) 
William 4 (estimated birth 1907, Hull Yorkshire) 
Lena S 1 (estimated birth 1910, Hull Yorkshire) 

Further, from Yorkshire freebmd their marriage in 1900: Peter APELLS Sarah J DONISON St John (Newington) Hull HR/5/190 

Now the request to find the father (called John Peter?) of Peter John (approx. 1879-1918, who was born in IJmuiden or Amsterdam), potentially came from the Tilburg area as a cheese seller?

all is correct my grand mother was marion appels, it is the family in holland that I search,peter john appels born 1879/80 was educated he could read and write so he went to school somewhere in holland,he married sarah jane donnison my gt grandmother who remarried 2 more times and died in grimsby a daughter of a fellow fisherman in hull.I have looked at peter jacob appels who had 2 daughters,but in tilburg the is a family that the family name peter john comes through and there is possible links, that is where I am asking for help
