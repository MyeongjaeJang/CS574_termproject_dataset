  CHC transfers 15000 passengers to and from Prelude FLNG 
20 March 2018 
Offshore helicopter operator CHC Helicopter has transferred approximately 15,000 passengers to and from the world’s largest offshore facility – Shell Prelude FLNG – since its arrival to the Prelude field offshore Australia. 
CHC said that the transfers were made with the four S-92s helicopters racking up 2,782 flight hours and 171,080 nautical miles with no injuries or incidents. 
Prelude is located 475km north-northeast of Broome and is in the process of being commissioned 
Approximately 800 people are working and living on Prelude and the adjacent accommodation support vessel during this commissioning phase of the project. 
“In the midst of all of this activity, the team in Broome have had to contend with two cyclones (hurricanes) and tropical lows which have dumped 1.5m (5ft) of rain on the coastal town and airport, where CHC has its base, in the last three months alone. That equates to more than two years’ worth of rainfall,” CHC said. 
When it comes to Shell’s Prelude project, the 488-meter-long and 74-meter-wide floating facility is located Browse Basin, approximately 475km north-north east of Broome in Western Australia, secured with 16 mooring chains since August 2017. Prelude FLNG facility will stay at the location for 20 to 25 years. 
The largest floating facility ever built will unlock new energy resources offshore and produce approximately 3.6 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) per year. It will remain onsite during all weather events, having been designed to withstand a category 5 cyclone. Production from the Prelude field is expected to start later this year.
