Zimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa has launched the country’s Information Communication Technology Policy to guide Zimbabwe’s economic development through a coordinated use of ICTs, reports The Herald. The ICT policy, together with the Innovation Drive, a policy to provide funding to young innovators, will provide strategic direction and guidance for sustainable national economic development through systematic and coordinated application of ICT’s, said Mnangagwa. 
The president said the ICT policy is aimed at transformation, growth, inclusiveness, sustainability, innovation and partnerships in the mainstream economy and puts in place institutional, legal and regulatory frameworks in order to achieve its intended goals. It is envisaged that all sectors of the economy and society at large will harness the power of ICT’s for the development of our nation. He commended players in the ICT’s sector for their advances that have seen the penetration rate rise to 95 percent and a geographical coverage of 75 percent. 
Mnangagwa said e-government would ensure that services are available to citizens in a convenient, efficient and transparent manner. In addition, he said the e-governance will help in the eradication of corruption through automated systems which remove bureaucratic impediments and bottlenecks, the president said. He urged government ministries, departments, agencies and parastatals to prioritise ICT in their operating systems and to spruce up their web sites.
