Building on the work of the workshop and of the TARN network, we aim in this session, to draw up an agenda for reform: Has the agency mandate been extended too widely? Can other forms of institutional innovation take the strain? Are new forms of accountability available which are more compatible with the duty of the EU executive to provide efficient and effective (good) governance? How can we minimise politics where it is a distraction; how can we maximise politics where it is needed? How does the poor bureaucratic function in a world of complex and conflicting demands for accountability and action?
