AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) Henry Nicholls posted his second century and highest test score before New Zealand declared with a 369-run first innings lead Sunday on the fourth day of the first cricket test against England. 
Nicholls was 145 not out, beating his previous best of 118, when captain Kane Williamson called his batsmen in with New Zealand 427-8 in reply to England’s first innings of 58. 
At the dinner break England was 38-1 with Mark Stoneman 18 not out and Joe Root 14, still trailing by 331 runs with four sessions remaining. Alastair Cook, after making 5 in the first innings, was out for 2 in the third over, caught down the leg side by wicketkeeper B.J. Watling from the bowling of Trent Boult.

New Zealand declared midway through the second session, noting the optimum time to bowl in day-night tests is often in the early evening when the floodlights begin to take effect and the pink ball is said to move more. 
After rain allowed only 23.1 overs on the second day and 17 balls on the third, New Zealand sought to bat itself towards an impregnable position in the first session Sunday. 
Nicholls, resuming at 52 not out, continued a marathon innings which built on the foundation established by captain Kane Williamson who made 102 – his 18th test century. He reached his century in 10 minutes less than six hours, from 228 balls and with 11 fours in an innings which has now spanned three days. 
Nicholls first came to the crease around 8pm on the first day and has batted, at least briefly, on each of the next three days before reaching his century Sunday. 
The 26-year-old gave few real chances. He was tested at times by Craig Overton who bowled a good spell in the middle of the first session. But he went through the 90s relatively swiftly, moving from 90 to 94 with a four through midwicket off Stuart Broad and from 94 to 98 with another boundary off long-on from Moeen Ali. 
There was a nervous moment as the umpires checked to see whether the ball, which had disappeared into the shadow of the main grandstand, had carried all the way for six, which would have brought up his century. 
It fell just short and Nicholls composed himself again, reaching three figures when he square drove Ali for two a few balls later. 
Nicholls had support throughout the day from B.J. Watling, who went from 18 not out overnight to 31 in a partnership of 54 for the fifth wicket. Colin de Grandhomme then made 29, adding 49 for the sixth wicket, Todd Astle scored 18 to put on 32 for the seventh wicket and Tim Southee 25 in a stand of 72 for the eighth wicket. 0 NZ 347-7, leads England by 289 at tea on day 4, 1st test UP NEXT NZ 347-7, leads England by 289 at tea on day 4, 1st test UP NEXT
