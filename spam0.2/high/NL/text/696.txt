Readers will continue to read on, knowing that there is a story or message of triumph, hope, peace, and redemption in the poems. Friedman also tells an impassioned and faith-driven message to the readers to find God, explore ones relationship with God and His wonders, and find the deeper meaning of what it is to be Gods follower. Stories and poems that come from the heart can establish a connection with readers. This is what Friedman hopes to achieve - bringing many readers, especially those suffering, those in despair and in darkness, to the light of Gods hope, love, and salvation.
