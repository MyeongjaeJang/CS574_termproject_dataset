AsiaSat revenue grows 6% in 2017, profit declines Tuesday 27 March 2018 | 06:35 CET | News Asia Satellite Telecommunications Company (AsiaSat) saw its revenue increase by 6 percent to HKD 1.35 billion in 2017 from HKD 1.27 billion in 2016. Revenue growth was boosted by the lease of the full Ku-band payload of AsiaSat 8 during the year, on-going migration from standard definition to high definition broadcasting and increased demand for data services, the company said. 
Profit reached HKD 397 million in 2017, down from HKD 430 million in 2016. On a like-for-like basis, after excluding a reversal of tax provision of HKD 55 million in 2016, 2017 profit recorded an increase of 6 percent or HKD 22 million compared to 2016. 
AsiaSat proposed a final dividend of HKD 0.20 per share. Together with the interim dividend of HKD 0.18 per share, the total dividend for the year 2017 is HKD 0.38 per share, compared to HKD 0.20 per share in 2016. 
AsiaSat also reports that overall payload utilisation of the AsiaSat fleet as of 31 December 2017 stood at 69 percent (126 transponders utilised/leased), compared to 67 percent at 31 December 2016 (99 transponders utilised/leased)
