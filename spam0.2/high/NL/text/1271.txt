T-Mobile US said customers can sign up for free MLB.TV subscriptions in the T-Mobile Tuesdays app starting 27 March until 2 April. The MLB.TV subscription includes all the premium features of the MLB At Bat app (a USD 19.99 value), including enhanced pitch tracking, home and away radio broadcasts, and more. A similar promotion was held a year ago by the operator. 
Baseball fans will also have the chance to win an all-expense-paid trip for two to MLB All-Star Week, 15-18 July, in Washington D.C. by entering in the T-Mobile Tuesdays app or on Twitter. The app will also offer customers 25 percent off at MLBShop.com and 10 cents off per gallon, up to 20 gallons of gas, at Shell.
