Global peer-to-peer payment and cryptocurrency investment service Circle has hired Naeem Ishaq, a former executive at Boxed and Square , as CFO, Treasurer, and Executive Vice President of Risk. 
Last month, Circle made headlines when the company acquired the digital asset exchange Poloniex. Up until December 2016, Circle operated a bitcoin exchange and hosted wallet . It has since ceased offering this service and now offers cryptocurrency investments through its newly launched app, Circle Invest . While this platform allows users to buy and sell several popular digital currencies, it is not a true wallet service, as it does not allow users to send or receive virtual currency payments. However, the company claims that it is planning to support cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals in the near future. Ishaq is joining the Circle team at a time of tremendous growth for the young company. During the time period between last December and February, Circle facilitated over $75 billion in transactions, according to growth metrics released by the company. Circle currently has over 7 million customers in more than 200 countries, and usage has grown by 450% in the past year. Circle has offices and personnel in Boston, New York, San Francisco, Dublin, London, Paris, Madrid, Milan, Beijing and Hong Kong. Notably, Circle has received $50 million in funding from the investment bank Goldman Sachs. 
In the blog post announcing the hiring of Ishaq, Circle co-founders Sean Neville and Jeremy Allaire wrote, “At this pivotal stage, we are growing from a startup to leading global company, just as crypto goes from early adopter novelty into being foundational to the future of society and the economy.”
