Vodafone Spain to offer online TV service throughout EU   08:38 CET | News Vodafone Spain has announced that from April onwards its customers will be able to access the Vodafone TV Online service throughout the European Union in exactly the same conditions as in Spain. The package comes with around 100 channels including Eurosport, Fox Life, TNT, Comedy Central and National Geographic as well as VoD content and can be linked to up to 4 devices. Itâ€™s also available with the zero-rated Video Pass in some packages but traffic consumed will count toward data bundles in others. 
The new conditions cover all EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
