German lawmakers prepare to call Facebook in for questions over data leaks   11:15 CET | News 
Members of the Digital Committee in the lower house of the German parliament, the Bundestag, have said they want to summon representatives from Facebook to Germany to answer questions on its data-sharing practices following reports that data from over 50 million Facebook users was leaked to Cambridge Analytica, reported Reuters. 
Lawmakers from the governing Grand Coalition of the conservative CDU and social-democratic SPD said they are going to request a special session of the Digital Committee on 23 March, Thomas Jarzombek, an IT expert in Chancellor Merkel's conservative CDU party, told Reuters. 
Jarzombek said lawmakers want to ask Facebook whether German users were affected by the data leaks and whether "comparable mechanisms" pose a danger to the data of German users of the social networking site. 
Earlier this week, the head of the Green party in the Bundestag, Konstantin von Notz, likewise told Reuters that he filed a request with Germany's Minister of the Interior for a report on Facebookâ€™s data-sharing practices with third parties like Cambridge Analytica.
