 Mein Schiff 2 Remains in TUI Cruises’ Fleet TUI Cruises German cruise line TUI Cruises revealed that Mein Schiff 2 will remain part of the company’s fleet.
As explained, the cruise line’s second cruise ship will continue to sail for TUI Cruises under another name and will not, as originally planned, be transferred to Marella Cruises.
The British Marella Cruises, part of TUI UK & Ireland, will acquire Golden Era instead of Mein Schiff 2, according to the company.
“Demand for cruises in the German-speaking region continues to be high and Mein Schiff 2 is extremely popular with our guests,” Wybcke Meier , TUI Cruises CEO, said, adding that the ship will remain “a centerpiece” of TUI Cruises’ fleet until April 2022.
Mein Schiff 2 has been deployed in the service of the Hamburg-based cruise line since 2011. Previously known as Celebrity Mercury, the vessel was purchased from Celebrity Cruises at the end of February 2011 and underwent a complete refit at Lloyd Werft shipyard.
In line with its fleet expansion efforts, TUI Cruises will introduce two new ships – one in 2018 and another one in 2019.
Consequently, TUI Cruises, a joint venture between TUI group and Royal Caribbean Cruises, will have a fleet of seven ships.
Additional newbuild, Mein Schiff 7 , is scheduled to join the company in 2023.
