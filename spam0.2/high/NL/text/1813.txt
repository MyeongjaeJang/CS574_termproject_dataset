Goldman Sachs Private Bank Provides Online Lending Capabilities to LPL Financial Advisors NEW YORK, NY – WEBWIRE – Wednesday, March 21, 2018 
Goldman Sachs is pleased to announce that LPL Financial (LPL) advisors can now help their clients borrow money for life events like paying for home renovations, education or travel by using Goldman Sachs Private Bank Select Ž ( GS Select ). With more than 15,000 advisors, LPL is one of the largest independent investment advisory firms to join the GS Select program, which currently supports 40 independent advisor firms and broker/dealers. 
GS Select is a high-tech platform backed by high-touch service. For suitable clients, it can cut the wait time for obtaining a non-purpose securities-based loan from Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank) to days from several weeks with no fees or paper to push. Advisors can track the status of each loan in real time, and a team of dedicated GS Select lending specialists is available to help advisors understand GS Select and monitor the loan process. 
LPLs advisors will be able to expand their relationships with clients by helping them manage their borrowing needs as efficiently as they manage their investments, said Andrew Kaiser, head of the Goldman Sachs Private Bank. We are growing GS Select to be the premier banking services provider in the independent financial advisor market. 
Clients can borrow between $75k and $25mm against the value of their accounts to avoid liquidating investments and stay invested. The loans can be used for any purpose other than for reinvestment in marketable securities. 
Kirby Horan, LPL executive vice president, said, We are committed to providing advisors with access to products and resources that enable choice and enhance the service and value they can deliver to their clients. Offering our advisors a program like GS Select is one more way LPL is making it easier for advisors to manage their businesses. 
GS Select builds upon LPLs 20-year relationship with Goldman Sachs, which now offers both investment and liquidity tools to LPL advisors and their clients. GS Select was launched as part of Goldman Sachs broader strategic initiative to expand its banking and lending presence. GS Select loans are originated by GS Bank and are collateralized by investment portfolios held by borrowers at the partner firms.
