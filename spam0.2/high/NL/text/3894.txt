Theres something that needs to be clarified in this whole Chick-fil-A business. 
Chick-fil-A is not only anti same-sex marriage. They are Anti-Gay everything. PERIOD . 
Chick-fil-A’s charitable arm has donated MILLIONS of dollars and services to anti-gay groups and nationally recognized hate groups including Focus on the Family and The Family Research Council whose hateful agendas go far beyond that of same-sex marriage but extends to other issues LGBT related issues as fighting ENDA and the repealing of DADT. 
Also, one of Chick-fil-A recipients was Exodus International an “ex-gay” organization that uses conversion therapy to attempt to turn gay people straight and has ruined the lives of countless of thousands of gay men and has even led some to commit suicide. 
Chick-Fil-A is not only anti same-sex marriage. They are anti-gay everything plain and simple. 
This is not a just a one issue subject issue where Dan Cathy and Chick-fil-A is concerned and we shouldn’t let it be portrayed that way by the right-wing, the mainstream media and our own LGBT media needs to remember that as portray them as that as well. Share this:
