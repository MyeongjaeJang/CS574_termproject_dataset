Celtic Clash 5 – Undercard Update By Joe O'Neill | on March 22,   
The full line-up has been confirmed for this weekend’s ‘Celtic Clash 5’ card. 
The Boxing Ireland and Tony Davitt venture ventures outside the National Stadium following three shows in 2017 for a special small hall brawl at Good Counsel GAA down the road in Drimnagh on Saturday [March 24th]. 
In a rematch of their six-round war on ‘Celtic Clash 4’, super featherweights Colin O’Donovan [1(1)-1(1)-1] and Stephen McAfee [2(2)-0-1] will renew hostilities here in a top-of-the-bill fight for the BUI Celtic title. 
Opponents for the undercard fights have been filtering through, and we now have a full roster for Saturday’s action. Widgets Magazine 
First though, some bad news, with it today being confirmed that Crumlin lightweight Martin Quinn [2(1)-0] has been forced off the bill. 
A proposed future foe for Quinn – Ballybrack’s Niall O’Connor [2(1)-0] – will get the chance for comparison on the card having been matched with Marcin Fincer. The Pole was stopped in the second by Quinn and in the third by headliner McAfee last year, offering O’Connor the chance to make a statement. Ficner [2(0)-20(9)-4] comes into the bout sharp having gone ten rounds in a bout in the Czech Republic earlier this month. 
In his comeback bout, Jobstown super bantamweight Carl McDonald [2(0)-1] will face Trayan Slavev [4(3)-15(11)-1]. ‘The Cobra’ has not fought since his loss to Regan Buckley on ‘Celtic Clash 3’ in September and will face a man who also featured that night. The opening bout of that card saw Slavev stopped in the third round by the debuting O’Donovan, who now headlines here just over six months later. 
The bill also features two fighters making their professional debuts. Cavan light middleweight Owen Duffy will get his pro career underway against Bulgarian Antoni Hristov [0-1(1)-1]. Blanchardstown light heavy Chris Scuvie will start against Poland’s Robert Krason [1(0)-0] – an unknown quantity having only had his first fight last month against another Polish debutant. 
As previously mentioned on Irish-Boxing.com, Lucan welter John Joyce [4(2)-0] will keep busy against Poland’s Tomasz Goluch [6(4)-10(5)], while inner-city welter Keane McMahon [2(0)-0] has perhaps the most testing match-up on the undercard versus Bulgarian Radoslav Mitev [10(2)-36(16)-1].
