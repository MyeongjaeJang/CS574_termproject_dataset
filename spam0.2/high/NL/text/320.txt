Share on: google + This week, our Man of the Weekend comes from the Bundesliga, where the Munich powerhouse met Germany’s latest challenger on the block, RB Leipzig. The Red Bull-endorsed side propelled themselves into the eye of world football last season, as they mounted an unexpected title challenge in their first Bundesliga season. Naby Keita scored and assisted in this weekend’s match-up with the eventual champions, and he was as pivotal in their success last season as he was yesterday, helping to show everyone just how far Leipzig have come. Their 2-1 win ended a 19-match unbeaten streak for Bayern Munich, with their Guinea international pulling the strings. First, he sprung an offside trap after some intricate passing inside the Bayern box, before showing persistence to level the scores for RB Leipzig after Sandro Wagner had headed the visitors ahead early on. And in the second half, it was his midfield dynamism that had the initiative to get on the ball in a central area, delay on the ball as Timo Werner curved his run to remain onside, then slot the young German in on goal to beat Sven Ulreich for 2-1. As ever in football, such a big win was the result of a first-class team performance, as these relative minnows saw off one of Europe’s elite. But there can only be one Man of the Weekend, and this week, it goes to the brilliance of Naby Keita.
