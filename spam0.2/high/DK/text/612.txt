Rare kills death tax in Sea of Thieves They are also releasing a game update today. Text: Suzanne Berget Published on the 27th of Mar 2018 at 15 
Last week Rare revealed through release notes on their official site that they would be implementing Death Cost, a death tax of sorts, meaning you would lose gold every time you died. The more preventable your death, the more gold you would stand to lose. 
" Death Cost - This new feature has the Captain of the Ferry of the Damned deduct a small gold fee when you die. Rates are dependant on the cause of death, so the more avoidable the death, the less patience the Captain will have when we enable this feature! Please note, we never intended to charge players for PvP related deaths, as we understand the negative impact this would have on player experience." 
After a lot of negative feedback on the death tax Rare decided to not implement it after all, as announced in a post on their official site. 
"One piece of additional feedback we've seen is around a proposed change listed in our release notes last week, and we've heard the sentiment there, so I can confirm that Death Cost is, well, dead. Thanks for the feedback here. We're listening." 
In the post they also detail several fixes across their services, stability and game experience that will come to the game when they release a new game client today. This is a full game update and will fix: Players temporarily missing items, reported performance issues on Xbox One X and players not receiving entitlements such as the Black Dog Pack. 
Other issues, such as player rewards and achievements being delayed and server issues, are still being worked on.
