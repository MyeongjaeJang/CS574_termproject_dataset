A video of a night out at Bangla Road, Patong starting at 1am. This is the last of 3 parts and covers Bangla Road in the early hours of the morning… 
Bangla Road is the centre of nightlife for the popular Thai holiday destination that is Phuket. 
It’s a great place for bar hopping, with many regular bars, beer bars, gogo bars, live music bars and nightclubs all on one street! 
There are lots of touts around, but if you walk with a beer in hand or a camera then generally they leave you alone.

Additional Comments: 
I want to show more footage from the bars in Patong, but can’t due to the SJWs that currently run YouTube. Consider being a member of the Bkk112 Patreon site to see this footage. 
https://twitter.com/bangkok112/status/941911853453606913 This tweet shows many age-restricted or yellow icon Bkk112 Patong videos that were made in the past. It’s not my choice, it’s just the way the land lies now…
