Xbox bots ban reviewer using DVR in mature game Buy Metropolis: Lux Obscura by all means, just don't take any pics. 1 comment 
A video game critic from BoxPlay has found himself on the receiving end of a two-week Xbox Live ban after using the DVR functionality of his Xbox One to take screenshots while playing a game he was reviewing. And by the looks of it, he's not the only one . 
It seems that Microsoft has no problem with selling Metropolis: Lux Obscura on its digital store, but its automated system for banning accounts that capture and share naughty or "pornographic" content has taken offence to the fact that images/footage were captured. After being flagged by the system, the content creator was subsequently hit with a fairly hefty timeout. 
Metropolis: Lux Obscura is rated 17+ and it's out now on PC, Xbox One, and even Nintendo Switch, and it's basically a match-3 puzzler with an adult comic book theme (we got Sin City vibes when we took a closer look). Think noir Bejewelled with scantily clad women and angry men with weapons and you'd be in the right ballpark. 
While most people won't complain about systems that have been put in place to protect innocent eyes from seeing things they shouldn't, this particular situation seems to be have been dealt with rather harshly all things considered. We're not at all surprised that the content creator in question took to Twitter to try and get some of the higher-ups on the Xbox team to take note. 
Could there be a better system in place to warn people more clearly of the implications of their actions in cases like this? Most certainly. In the meantime this acts as a cautionary tale; be careful what you capture when you're playing on Xbox One because you never know who's watching... Related texts
