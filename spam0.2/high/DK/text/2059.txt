The latest update for the Nintendo Switch is now live, and by the update number you can tell that they haven't made any major changes, or added some of the fun and cool stuff we're waiting for. Instead, Nintendo has opted for more stability and fixing some minor bugs. 
Here are the improvements included in version 5.0.2 General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience, including: Resolved an issue that caused motion controls to respond incorrectly when playing games that use the feature Resolved an issue that caused user icons for recommended friends to not display correctly 
The motion control issue is a pretty good and necessary fix, though. Have you experienced any problems with your motion controllers? Hopefully, you won't after this has been applied. You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now ! Ã—
