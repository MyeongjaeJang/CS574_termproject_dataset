A lady who goes by the Twitter handle @tashidahbakward is currently trending on the social media platform after she declared that she will supply milk to anyone who gives her money. 
The Nigerian lady shared a suggestive picture of herself with the message as the caption. 
See her post below; 
Recall that some days back another lady on Twitter also made a controversial post, in which she compared men to two cucumbers. 
The lady in question was dragged especially by male twitter users for daring to compare the their manhood to ordinary cucumbers. 
She shared a picture of herself holding 2 cucumbers and said they are well built, well sized than that of men.. 
But the feedback she got will blow you away, some of the men took it a little far as they were clearly pissed by her offensive comments.. 
See some of their reactions below; More from my site
