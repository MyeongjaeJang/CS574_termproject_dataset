Products and technologies for digitalising the industrial value chain have been on the market for several years, but figuring out how to piece them together can be difficult. From 23 to 27 April 2018, HANNOVER MESSE and CeMAT provide a complete overview of available solutions, from Industry 4.0, Logistics 4.0 and integrated energy to robots, machines and components. Exhibitors demonstrate how to integrate automation technology, software and IT into plants and factories to create intelligent production, energy and logistics systems. For example, collecting and analysing data in the cloud makes it possible to develop additional, internet-based services. Virtual power plants bundle electricity from numerous small generators and feed it into the power grid in the precise amounts negotiated at the time of purchase. Advertisement
