A couple of weeks ago we talked to Carlos Gonzalez at PAX East 2018, and during our chat in Boston we found out more about his studio's new game, Faeland . During the interview Gonzalez mentioned a planned crowdfunding campaign for the project, and that's now up and running on Kickstarter , with the studio after Â£20,000 (or regional equivalent) so they can finish the game, with stretch goals including potential console versions (it's currently only confirmed for PC). Check out the full interview below for more on this charming-looking RPG-centric fantasy-themed metroidvania. Related texts
