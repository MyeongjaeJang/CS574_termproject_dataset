“From the unique open-air setting to the magnificent illuminations, not to mention the worldclass line-up of choral singers, this is the only event of its kind in Belgium – even in Europe,” enthuses Meurens. Nuit des Choeurs sees six professional choirs singing on a loop throughout the evening on different stages. The lineup is the same for both the Friday night and the Saturday night. Each concert begins at the same time and lasts 20 minutes, allowing for the public to move between performances without disrupting the music. At the end of the night all the singers come together for a grand finale, topped off with a breathtaking fireworks display. Advertisement
