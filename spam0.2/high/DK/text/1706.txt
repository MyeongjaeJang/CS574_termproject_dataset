Peter Nielsen, 53, appeared before a court in Yaba, a suburb of Lagos, on Wednesday to face a two-count charge of killing his wife, Zainab, and their daughter, Petra, on April 5th, a senior police officer told AFP. 
"The chief magistrate ordered that Nielsen should be remanded in Ikoyi prison pending legal advice from Lagos state director of public prosecution on a proper trial in the high court," he said. 
The officer said the suspect had hit his wife's head against the wall several times, inflicting fatal injuries. 
The police officer said Nielsen later poisoned his daughter and tried to cover up the murders as a domestic accident. 
Zainab, a 37-year-old singer popularly known as Alizee, was a rising Nigerian star. 
The case, which has generated media attention and publicity in Nigeria, a country where domestic violence is receiving more attention, has been adjourned to May 8th. 
Last month, the Lagos state governor Akinwunmi Ambode led a march against domestic violence in support of a 25-year jail term for rapists.
