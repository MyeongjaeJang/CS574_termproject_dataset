Tripwire Interactive has released the free Infinite Onslaught Content Update for their co-op shooter Killing Floor 2, which adds a new Endless Mode that sees players face endless waves of Zeds. That's not all though, as players are also getting three new weapons (MAC- 10 SMG, Husk Cannon, AF2011-A1 pistol), a new playable character by the name of D.A.R., two new maps (Powercore and Diesector), and much more. 
Tripwire also announced that Killer Floor 2 has sold more than 5 million copies since its release on May 14, 2009. 
"Continued sales for both the original Killing Floor and Killing Floor 2 post-launch is the kind of thing that can't happen unless we keep things new and exciting for players," said Bill Munk, Killing Floor 2 product lead at Tripwire Interactive. "That's why post-launch content updates and continued support for the Killing Floor community continues to be a top priority for us." 
The update is free on PC (Steam), PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, and you can check out the new content in the trailer below. Do you think that Killing Floor 2 can continue to be popular in the coming years? Related texts
