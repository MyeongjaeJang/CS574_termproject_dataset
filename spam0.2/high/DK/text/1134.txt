PUBG to limit keyboard and mouse on Xbox One Devs want a level playing field on console. Text: David Caballero Published on the 5th of Apr 2018 at 09 
It was already known that PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds developer Bluehole/PUBG Corp was looking into ways to limit or even to ban the option to use the keyboard and mouse combo for players on Xbox One, as it means a disadvantage for traditional controller users. Now, community coordinator "RoboDanjal" has underlined their intention to "curb" the use of third-party input devices, with a full plan to be unveiled "soon": 
"We have been gathering in-game information regarding Third Party device usage over the past few months. Although usage of these devices is statistically very low, fair gameplay is core to our experience, and we will be communicating our plan to curb the use of these devices soon," he wrote to a frustrated player on Twitter , though there's no approximate date for a fix as of yet.
