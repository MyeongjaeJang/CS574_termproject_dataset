Will EA's next Star Wars game have open world elements? A new job listing points to online as well. Text: Stefan Briesenick Published on the 26th of Mar 2018 at 17 
After EA shut down famous Dead Space studio Visceral Games last year, Amy Hennig's Star Wars game got chopped into pieces very much like necromorph limbs. It turns out though that EA Vancouver could finally make use of these ideas, because they're ramping up the staff for their next Star Wars game. 
In one of the company's job listings we see that EA is searching for an online expert who would be responsible for implementing different online features i.e. "Matchmaking, Asynchronous interactions, Live services [and] Server-host migration" (among many, many more tasks). The applicant in question will join "a veteran team to design, architect, and implement the online infrastructure" for the Star Wars universe. 
According to Only Single Player the job description has been changed since its publication, as prior EA asked more specifically for people to lead their "open-world project" set in the Star Wars universe, but now this term is gone missing for whatever reason.
