PUBG may get region-locked servers New weapon skin system and crates are also in the works. Text: Suzanne Berget Published on the 30th of Mar 2018 at 15 
In a recent community update on PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds' official Steam page, the developers outline different ways to improve the gameplay environment, which includes providing a stable network experience for players, and they have started on this by implementing a ping-based matchmaking system, among other things. Another solution they're also considering, however, is region-locked servers. 
"One of the solutions we are considering is operating servers so that only those players who reside in that region can connect and play," the post reads. "These servers will be made invisible to players residing in other regions. But, at the same time, if a player in an exclusive server region forms a team with a player from another region, they can connect to and play on any of the servers available to either of them." 
This will hopefully improve network issues and help with linguistic barriers. They're going to run a limited test of this approach, and if the updates made to the test build are stable, they will be applied to the live servers, with a timeline being provided for the live server update shortly. 
In addition they're also implementing a Weapon Skin System that lets players customise their weapons and select a different skin for each. New free/paid weapon skin crates are also on their way, and you can read more about the updates and bug fixes here .
