no distance paddling todayâ€¦ 
but it it was rather playtime! 
John, Josh and myself went out back to Sunset Bay and played around in our (almost empty) kayaks, in quite some wind and a brief but nasty hail storm. Inside the bay, it was nicely sheltered to do some rolls and practice some rescues, but John liked also to paddle out upfront the reef with Josh and me, which I honestly didnâ€™t feel comfortable with in quite some big seas, strong winds and empty kayaksâ€¦and I was really not keen to peel either of the guys off the reef, just in caseâ€¦and I asked them to please turn in again. 
John opted then to play on the break in between the reef â€“ and there, I had to get a paddler first time since years back into his kayak in a serious capsizeâ€¦thank goodness the reef was far enough awayâ€¦it worked all right. 
Josh felt very comfortable out in the big stuff in his (myâ€¦) kayak, it looked very promising for me to keep on going with him. 
In the afternoon, it was to top up our food shopping, and Josh bought some softer and smaller dry bags to make packing easier. I was teaching him how to get rid of all those surplus and stiff packs and wrappingsâ€¦ziplocks bags it is! 
We discovered Johnâ€™s gym ball, and I couldnâ€™t help to test if a headstand on a gym ball could top a headstand on a double balance boardâ€¦I would say it couldâ€¦ ðŸ™‚
