Additional notes: 
This bad night out was all my own fault as I went out far too late initially. If youâ€™re hitting the bars of Chiang Mai I recommend to go out no later than 7pm, ideally start around sunset (6pm) to ensure you have enough drinking time. 
My plan was simple for the night, have some food at the Mad Dog, then head to Loi Kroh street for some beers, maybe check out the Muay Thai boxing, more bars, and then Spicy club later on. But it didnâ€™t all go to planâ€¦ 
I also lost my iPhone on this night too (100% my fault) and thatâ€™s probably what prompted me to head back to the hotel early. 
My following nights out in Chiang Mai were much better than this one, as I went out 6pm and had plenty of time for hitting the bars and made it to a few clubs too.
