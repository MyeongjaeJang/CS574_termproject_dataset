Collective of female gamers targets misogynists in CS:GO Bully Hunters will kill offenders (in the game). Text: Magnus Groth-Andersen Published on the 13th of Apr 2018 at 15 
Misogyny and harassment of female gamers is sadly something that's still around today, and while there are organisations and initiatives that have been created to help and support, a group of women has banded together to take matters into their own hands. 
Introducing Bully Hunters, a group of female gamers that aim to take out misogynists one at a time. They describe themselves as a "vigilante hit squad of elite female gamers," and through a series of Twitch-streams, where the first is already available , their plan is to kill players in-game who harass women. 
They've also put out a mission statement on YouTube , stating that "If you think harassment is just part of the game, we know who you are, we know what you play, and we are coming for you." 
What do you make of this sort of direct action? Will it transform the offenders? Related texts
