The Philippines is one of the most enjoyable countries to travel in. We backpacked for 5 weeks in this country and had a great time. Here is an impression. Like they say: It is more fun in the Philippines. They are absolutely right. 
Our route was: Manila, Cagayan de Oro, Camiguin Island, Surigao, Siargao Island, Sogod, Padre Burgos, Ormoc, Tacloban, Calbayog, Legazpi, Naga, Caramoan Peninsula and back to Manila. Teilen mit:
