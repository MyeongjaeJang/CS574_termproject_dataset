Fortnite on iOS made over $1 million USD in three days And that was in microtransactions alone. Text: Magnus Groth-Andersen Published on the 21st of Mar 2018 at 14 
While Fortnite: Battle Royale has yet to launch on iOS in a number of key markets, it's still set to be a major money maker for Epic Games, as the game (which is free-to-play) has a business model centered around microtransactions, and has already reached an impressive milestone. 
According to data from Sensor Tower , which is a company that monitors mobile applications, the game has already generated over $1.5 million USD in revenue, and has reached this in under three days. 
That's very impressive, but not near the success of big competitors like Pok√©mon Go, which managed to triple that figure in four days on the market. Either way, we're sure Epic Games won't be too disappointed, especially if this sum continues to grow. 
Do you think that Battle Royale on iOS can be a continued success? Related texts
