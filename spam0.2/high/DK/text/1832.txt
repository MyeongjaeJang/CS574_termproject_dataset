Didi Chuxing 
Ride-hailing company Uber has announced that it has acquired Jump Bikes, a New York-based firm that operates in 40 US cities. Jump Bikes is a free service operation which uses electric bikes. Jump and Uber have already been working together in San Francisco since the beginning of the year. In that city, it has thus been possible to use the Uber app to rent a Jump bike. The bikes can be left anywhere in the city and are located by GPS. 
Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi explained on his blog post that the company is looking to expand the modes of transport available via its app, and these will include bikes and subways. 
This is not the first time that ride-hailing companies have moved from four wheels to two. Earlier this year, China's Didi Chuxing made a move into the Chinese bike-sharing market. And in the United States, Lyft announced that it was taking an interest in Baltimore bikeshare stations as recently as last month.
