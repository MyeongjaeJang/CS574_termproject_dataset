This week's charts have now landed, and it'll be no surprise for many given the previous months of hype and testing periods that Microsoft and Rare's Sea of Thieves has sailed into the top spot on its debut week, meaning that it has triumphed over another three debuts in the top four. 
Just below Rare's pirate adventure is EA's co-operative game A Way Out, closely followed by Bandai Namco's stellar RPG Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom, and the return of Assassin's Creed Rogue in the form of a remaster, meaning that all these new games have been particularly popular with gamers. 
Below that Burnout Paradise Remastered has slipped to 5, while the usual suspects like FIFA 18 and Grand Theft Auto V share the rest of the success in the top 10 with Nintendo's mascot Mario and EA's UFC 3. For the full top 10, however, you can check below.
