Featuring interactive workshops, unique pop-ups, a music programme curated by YOYO’s Seb Chew and a special live performance of BBC theme tunes from the BBC Concert Orchestra. 
The festival will showcase a range of ‘test card’ menus from the leading line-up of restaurants, many of which are due to open permanent sites at Television Centre. Homeslice will be offering a slice of pizza and beer deal; Kricket will be serving its epic Bhel puri and Keralan fried chicken (KFC) whilst the crowd favourite Ari Gold will be on the menu in slider form at Patty & Bun. Bluebird Café will feature hero dishes including Nduja crusted yellow fin tuna with grilled onion and green sauce, whilst tacos and margaritas will be brought to West London by the city’s favourite taqueria, Bad Sports. The Allis, a cocktail concept by the Soho House Group will be open and offering a selection of fruity cocktail options too. 
Accompanying the diverse food and drink offerings will be a programme of DJ performances curated by YOYO’s Seb Chew, while the festival will also feature a series of live podcasts from The Pod and a live performance from the BBC Concert Orchestra on Thursday 12 April at 7:30pm.
