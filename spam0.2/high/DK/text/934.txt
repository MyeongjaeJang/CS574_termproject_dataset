Caesar returns in triumph to Rome and the people pour out of their homes to celebrate. Alarmed by the autocratâ€™s popularity, the educated Ã©lite conspire to bring him down. After his assassination, civil war erupts on the streets of the capital. ðŸŽ– 
Bridge Theatreâ€™s auditorium is transformed for Nicholas Hytnerâ€™s promenade staging of Shakespeareâ€™s political thriller. 
You can choose from two ways of experiencing the production: sit in-the-round and look onto the arena, or become part of the action and join the crowd of hundreds that stand amongst the street party greeting Caesarâ€™s triumphant return to Rome, the congress that witnesses his murder and the civil war that erupts in the wake of his assassination. 
Ben Whishaw and Michelle Fairley play Brutus and Cassius, leaders of the coup, David Calder plays Caesar and David Morrissey is Mark Antony, who brings Rome back under control after the conspiratorsâ€™ defeat.
