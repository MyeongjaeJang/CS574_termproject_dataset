just stella Trousers / AFTERHOMEWORK 
Model Stella Klein is sensuously captured by the lens of photography duo Yan&Céline in this Schön! online editorial. Fashion by Glen Mban sees Stella ‘s posturing rounded out by amply subtle silhouettes by AFTERHOMEWORK, Christian Dada and Christian Louboutin. Hair by Akemi Kishida and makeup by Océane Sitbon-Ghoula perfectly complement the serene scene. Dress & earring / Christian Dada
