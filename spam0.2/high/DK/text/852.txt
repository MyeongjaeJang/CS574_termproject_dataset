With the launch of its Battle Royale mode, Fortnite has risen to the top of the charts, struggling with PUBG, the former undisputed leader, and after many months and many records reached, the analyst Newzoo brings new data on the category and the titles that compose it. 
First, we can see that the Battle Royale genre as a whole continues to rise. We learn that the genre is played by 30.1 percent of core PC gamers and can almost be summed up in two games: PUBG and Fortnite. Indeed, the throne is strongly disputed between the two titles, although PUBG is losing its pace for the first time, a weakness exploited by Epic Games' title. 
For the month of February, PUBG recorded "only" 14.6% of players compared to 16.3% for their rival Fortnite. Ark: Survival Evolved meanwhile is consistent, but its performance is in a different league, not exceeding 3%. 
One can guess through this graph how much the genre owes to PUBG. Indeed, if one observes the curves before the arrival of Bluehole 's title, the Battle Royale genre interested less than 10% of the core PC gamers, before skyrocketing at the same pace as PUBG. 
It only remains to be seen how PUBG Corp will react to regain control which will be a challenging task considering Fortnite's momentum, perfectly supported by Epic Games. Do you think these numbers can grow further for the genre? Related texts
