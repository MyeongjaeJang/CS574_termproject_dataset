Natalia Reyes has been cast in the lead role for the upcoming cinematic reboot of Terminator, which is being helmed by James Cameron. According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/james-camerons-terminator-reboot-finds-star-colombian-discovery-1099118" title="The Hollywood Reporter" target="_blank">The Hollywood Reporter</a, Colombian actor Reyes - who starred in the Spanish TV series Cumbia Ninja and Lady, La Vendedora de Rosas - will play the role of Dani, a young woman from a working-class neighborhood in Mexico City who finds herself in the middle of the war between humans and machines. 
James Cameron and Skydance consider Reyes something of a "discovery", in the same vein as when Cameron cast a young Linda Hamilton in the 1984 original. Hamilton starred in that movie alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger, who famously played the Terminator, and both actors will return in the new film. Mackenzie Davis (Blade Runner 2049), Gabriel Luna (Ghost Rider in Agents of Shield), and Diego Boneto (Scream Queens) will also star. 
Production of Terminator starts this May, while the movie is slated for a worldwide release in November 2019. You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now ! Ã—
