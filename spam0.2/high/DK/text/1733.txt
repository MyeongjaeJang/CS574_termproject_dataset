Decreasing Danish winds herald cloudy spring weekend Ritzau/The Local File photo: Torben Christensen/Ritzau Scanpix Ritzau/The Local 13 April 2018 09:55 CEST+02:00 Strong winds at the beginning of this weekend will calm to bring about temperatures of up to 17 degrees Celsius. 
The weekend weather is also expected to remain mostly dry, according to Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) forecasts. 
“It will not be very cold, neither will it be very wet, but it does look as though clouds will generally dominate the weather over the weekend,” DMI meteorologist Anja Bodholdt said. 
An even to hard easterly wind on Friday will give a colder feel to conditions, particularly on the Baltic Sea coast, Bodholdt said. 
Friday’s temperature will be between 10-15°C. Byger trækker i dag op over den syd- og vestlige del af Danmark.

But winds will decrease during the night on Friday, and Saturday will begin with calm spring weather, the meteorologist said. 
Most of the country will be covered by cloud on Saturday, with isolated sunny spells and showers in southwestern parts. 
“The temperature will be between ten and 15 degrees, but onshore winds on the coast could make it feel colder,” Bodholdt said. 
Sunday will be a little clearer. 
“Sunday could begin with a little fog here and there and reach up to around 17 degrees, while people in West Jutland could be in for a localised shower or two,” the meteorologist forecast.
