Overwatch adding the option to avoid players Some dudes just don't get it. Text: Stefan Briesenick Published on the 26th of Mar 2018 at 13 
Overwatch's community has grown strong over the past couple of years, and with everyone's eyes on the game there comes all kinds of players with it as well. Some of them are, to put it politely, pretty arduous, and if you've been waiting for an option to avoid certain players, you're in luck. 
Jeff Kaplan has come to the rescue for these particular individuals, as in the latest developer update (which you can see below) the Overwatch director announced the 'avoid player' option, which is currently available for testing in the PTR (Public Test Realm) environment. 
The full feature will be heading to the live servers in the near future, and once this goes live you can mark up to two players as 'avoided' and the matchmaking should ensure they don't match with you for the next seven days. After that duration these players will automatically drop out of the system and you can place them back in again manually. It's also possible to undo the mark between matches, if you have a change of heart. 
By the way, this kind of feature was implemented within the game a few years ago, but eventually got pulled by Blizzard because players abused it. Have you encountered any trolls lately that you'd like to test this on? Related texts
