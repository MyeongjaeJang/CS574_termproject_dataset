Wherever power flows along a wire or data is transmitted along a bre optic cable, a HellermannTyton product is never far away. From humble beginnings 83 years ago in Germany, the company has become one of the leading global suppliers of products used to fasten, x, connect, insulate, protect and identify electrical and digital cabling. Paul Hellermann probably did not imagine just how big his 1935 Hamburg startup would grow. The company still sells rubber grommets and cable binding tools like the ones he invented to protect cable sheaths from damage. But the product portfolio is now considerably broader. HellermannTyton supplies thousands of items used to route, fasten, protect and mark the wiring in vehicles, machinery and buildings. Advertisement
