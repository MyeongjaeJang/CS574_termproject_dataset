Studio Wildcard describes ARK: Survival Evolved as a "massive prehistoric survival adventure experience", and it was fully launched back in August of last year (read our review for more on the game) 
Studio Wildcard used the opportunity during Epic Games' State of Unreal keynote at GDC 18 to announce that ARK: Survival Evolved is coming to Nintendo Switch this autumn both as a digital download and in physical form. Switch version is being developed in collaboration with Abstraction Games and will contain all the content and features of the original game. 
Studio Wildcard's co-creative director Jeremy Stieglitz stated that "the Switch's handheld mode provides a fantastic new capability for survivors who want to fully immerse themselves in the vast worlds of ARK. With this new version, Switch players can go directly from hunting and taming while sitting on the couch, to forming online tribes and searching out new conquests when on the bus, waiting in line, or wherever they happen to be." 
The developer also announced that the creators of ARK: Survival Evolved mobile game, War Drum Studios, have sent out the "first wave" of invitations to the closed beta for iOS players.
