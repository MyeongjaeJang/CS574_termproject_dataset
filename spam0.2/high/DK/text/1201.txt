You will find much more than the average handbag at Oh My Bag! Ramet selects her collection with great care. “Of course, quality is very important to me,” she begins. “So I only sell brands that I know deliver quality every time.” Quality is not the only requirement though – a handbag has to be special. That does not necessarily mean extravagant, but unique and eye-catching nonetheless. “I want people to find something here that they won’t find in a regular store. I get that a lot from my customers. Recently there was a woman who travelled more than 30 kilometres to visit my boutique.” Advertisement
