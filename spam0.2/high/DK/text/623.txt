Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon's Creative Director Dean Evans has worked at Ubisoft for over 12 years, but now he's taking a break from business, as in a recent interview with GameInformer the developer revealed his departure while also talking about his design philosophy regarding the future of gaming. 
Most recently Evans developed a game concept for the French publisher which got suspended in the end, but before that he helped to build up the Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, and Far Cry franchises. When Ubisoft offered him a new position the designer decided to step back and take vacation instead, saying he never really had that in the past. Good job Dean, take your time.
