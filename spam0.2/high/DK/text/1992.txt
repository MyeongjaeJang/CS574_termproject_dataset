By the end of 2019, Porsche plans on operating a network of 500 fast chargers at dealerships and along highways across the United States. 
By that time, the production car based on the Mission E electric vehicle concept will be for sale in showrooms. A second EV, based on the Mission E Cross Turismo concept, should be ready by 2020. EV variants of existing models like the Macan, Panamera and Cayenne are also under consideration. 
The chargers will be capable of charging a car's batteries to 80% of their capacity in under 20 minutes. 
According to Porsche, 80 to 90% of EV owners will charge their cars at home or at work. Nevertheless, an EV's range acts as a psychological barrier which Porsche wants to alleviate with this charger network.
