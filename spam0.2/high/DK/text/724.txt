After having spent a few years in development at Overkill/Starbreeze (makers of the Payday titles), Overkill's The Walking Dead is now locked in for release this fall on PC, PS4, and Xbox One. Overkill's The Walking Dead is a four-player cooperative first-person shooter. Each character will have their own abilities, a skill tree, and a personal story. Players will be able to choose a strategy, try and be stealthy about it or go in loud. 
Overkill, in collaboration with Robert Kirkman's Skybound Entertainment and publishing partner 505 Games unveil the work that has gone into creating the Georgetown map based on the district in Washington DC in the dev diary below, the first in a series. Related texts
