Walking into Guy-David Lambrechts’ men’s fashion shop in Antwerp is like being transported back to Victorian times. With its mosaic floor, dark mahogany furniture, 19th century portraits and stained glass, the whole building exudes timeless class only rivalled by the clothes worn by the mannequins inside. As one of Antwerp’s most soughtafter men’s fashion designers, Guy-David Lambrechts dresses people of all sizes in made-to-measure garments all over the world. But his creations are not only made to measure; in designing them, Lambrechts also deeply considers the personality of the wearer. Advertisement
