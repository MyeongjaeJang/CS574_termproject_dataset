With the launch of Sea of Thieves, Microsoft released a new controller inspired by Rare's new pirate game. The controller, in addition to a really eye-catching design with purple and green colours and fantastic pirate decorations, also includes an exclusive download code for the Ferryman Clothing Set DLC, which players can then use in the game. 
Apparently, this costume set is becoming really popular, because if you take a look on eBay , you'll discover that this content is now selling for $70.00, exactly the same cost as the controller itself.
