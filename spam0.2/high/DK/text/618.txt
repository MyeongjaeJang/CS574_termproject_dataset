Get The Darkness II free on PC Humble Store has a very bloody gift for us. Text: Eirik Hyldbakk Furu Published on the 27th of Mar 2018 at 11 
Over the last few weeks you might say that we've seen more than enough great games launch just in time for Easter, but how about an extra freebie on PC? 
Humble Store is offering the PC version of Digital Extremes' The Darkness II for free until 6PM BST / 7PM CEST on Wednesday. We found the game to be very entertaining six years ago and still do, so we definitely recommend that you take advantage of this great offer. Related texts
