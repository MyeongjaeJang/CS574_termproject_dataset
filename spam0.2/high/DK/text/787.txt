Solve puzzles, quests, brain-teasers and mini-games to rid the city of the wicked Black Cap Brotherhood robots. Gorgeous hand-drawn graphics and animations bring the robotâ€™s story to life, using unique comic bubbles and symbols to convey the plot. The Machinarium world is populated only by robots of various forms and functions. One of the most interesting places in this world is old, rusty and legendary city of Machinarium where the game takes place. Backgrounds and characters are 2D hand-drawn represented through carefully crafted animations.
