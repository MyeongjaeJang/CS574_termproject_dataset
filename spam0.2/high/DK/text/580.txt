Stefano Guzzini was invited to present research from his ongoing book project on 'Power in International Relations' to the postgraduate seminar in IR Theory at the London School of Economics. His paper showed the different domains of power analysis in the realist tradition and how their confusion has haunted much analysis until today. The following day, Stefano Guzzin led a Research Design Workshop with PhD students from London School of Economics and King's College, London. Guzzini provided extensive feedback for seven students at different stages of their dissertation who discussed each other's project, articles or chapters.
