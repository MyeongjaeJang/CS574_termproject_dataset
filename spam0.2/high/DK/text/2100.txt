SpecialEffect , the British charity that's behind the event One Special Day, has just launched some unique open-source software called EyeMine, which enables people with severe physical disabilities to play Minecraft with their eyes. The sofware can be downloaded for free by anyone with a Minecraft account, and is compatible with a number of eye trackers that can control a mouse pointer. The software is currently only available for Windows PC. 
SpecialEffect has had help from a number of people with physical disabilities during development and testing, and has managed to create a program with a number of ability levels. By using their gaze to select a square button on the monitor they can walk, fly and attack in the game. With more accurate eye control players can build, select items from the inventory, and chat with other players. 
"For us, EyeMine represents a watershed development. It's a flagship example of taking the experience we've gained through our one-to-one work with gamers with the most severe physical disabilities and translating it into a means of helping a huge number of people on a global scale," said SpecialEffect Founder and CEO Dr Mick Donegan.
