Released in Japan on March 21, Valkyria Chronicles 4 will be coming to the west this autumn, this according to Sega. While a specific release date has yet to be announced by the publisher, two different retailers have listed two contrasting release dates during the weekend. 
The US Amazon site lists Valkyria Chronicles 4 with a release date scheduled to October 16, while Best Buy went with a September 28 release date. Which one is it? Is either of them correct? We have no idea, but this could be an indication that an official announcement is on the way. 
Valkyria Chronicles 4 is being released on PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. Related texts
