Hearthstone developers discuss The Witchwood expansion Horror stories and the new cards star in a behind the scenes video. Text: David Kers   12 
The Witchwood, the latest expansion for Blizzard's digital card game Hearthstone, was released last week and in a new video, the developers take us through the process that went into the creation of the new card set. Game director Ben Brode talks about adding the Worgen to the game and senior game designer Dave Kosak explains how the team wanted to tell some horror stories. The central theme here is very much "spooky". 
In the video, some new cards are also discussed, including the Legendary card Hagatha the Witch, which was everything "you should be scared of in The Witchwood", as well as how another Legendary, Shudderwock, was "the most complicated card we have ever made". Check out the video below for more on the new cards. Related texts
