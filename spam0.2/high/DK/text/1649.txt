Andrew House thinks the PS4 still has a long life ahead He responded to the PS5 rumours in a recent interview. Text: Markus Hirsilä Published on the 12th of Apr 2018 at 13 
A few days ago former Sony Interactive Entertainment chief Andrew House was interviewed during a GamesBeat conference, and one of the questions of course revolved around his ideas about the rumoured PlayStation 5. He refused to talk specifics, but he predicted that the PS4 still has a long life ahead of it. 
House said: "I'm very bullish on longer life cycles for consoles. Consoles are so under-represented and under-penetrated in so many markets around the globe. There's so much potential. Let's not forget that China is still largely [untapped]." 
House also thinks that the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X will help to extend the life cycle of this console generation, as well as sensing that physical media isn't going anywhere anytime soon: 
"I don't have any firm knowledge on this, but my sense is that you will see the disc around in the industry for a while. If you're going to tap into some of these [developing] markets, then allowing for that more traditional physical purchase model as an option is probably no bad thing." 
Cloud-streaming of games is going to be a big thing in video games in the next console generation too, according to House, but it will be side by side with more traditional forms of video game content. "Other than the technical challenges, there's no reason why game streaming can't be present in games in the same way that we have seen in the music and film and television industries," he said.
