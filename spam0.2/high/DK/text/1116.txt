In the beating heart of East London, Ted Baker is bringing his latest Colour By Numbers collection to life with an immersive pop-up experience. 
Situated inside the bustling Old Street Station complex, which is home to a thriving community of pop-up shops, established retail businesses and lively cafes and bars. 
Complementing this energetic environment is a full schedule of events and activity including restorative yoga classes and enlightening discussion events with fashion influencers Freddie Harrell and Megan Ellaby, as well as partnerships with independent food and drink businesses, including local coffee house Shoreditch Grind. 
Celebrating simple silhouettes and considered colourways, Ted’s Colour By Numbers curated collection for women reworks timeless patterns in a directional approach unlike anything the brand has created before. 
Using contemporary art galleries as its starting point, the pop-up employs a clean, monochrome colour scheme with translucent opalescent panels laid out in a graphic zigzag pattern. This thoroughly modern use of materials and shapes creates a fresh, serene backdrop for the vibrant new Colour by Numbers collection, and as with an actual art gallery, allows the dynamic feel and quirky detail of each piece to shine and be appreciated in full. 
Wednesdays, Yoga with Chromayoga– Multi-sensory yoga experience combining light and colour therapy techniques– Blue (for boosting productivity) and Yellow (with twists to open posture) yoga sessions from 7:30am
