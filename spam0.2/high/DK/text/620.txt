Space ships are heading to World of Warships this week April is going to be full of fools in giant warships sailing through space. Text: Stefan Briesenick Published on the 27th of Mar 2018 at 09 
Wargaming.net unveiled a crazy new game mode called Space Warships, just in time for April Fool's. Starting March 29 players can battle with huge sci-fi spaceships in the infinite space between the worlds. In just two months the team designed nine mighty space vessels for this timed in-game event. 
Space Warships runs until April 11, and to participate players must have reached Level 12 and have obtained at least one ship from Tier VI or higher. Once the event goes live there will be a "special battle mission" before we can get our hands on a space cruiser. 
More details can be found below, with ship descriptions and some screens showing the Space Warships: 
FlyFire: an elegant design with excellent rocket armament and awesome stealth systems 
Galaxy: quantum-cumulative shells and an anti-drone disruptor field will surely come in handy 
Hellcarrier: control swarms of drones to conquer even the most distant corners of space! 
Paris: armor and speed combined with quick-firing guns and unique ion thrusters 
Zaya: as beautiful as a star butterfly, and as dangerous as a Tellurian serpent—that's all you need to know 
Norma: a special turbolaser battery with a unique reloading system, and ion rockets that obliterate all matter in their way 
Aurora: "No phantoms shall pass" is the main motto of the engineers who designed this powerful and majestic cruiser 
Alldestroyer: excellent all-rounder—thick armor, great guns and a large number of small laser turrets 
Blue Aster: a good choice if you need to disintegrate another disintegrator, so that it doesn't disintegrate your disintegrator Related texts
