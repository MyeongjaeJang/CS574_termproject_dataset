last weather day! 
The guys went out for another play at Sunset Bay, the elderly lady preferred to play the shore bunny and to save her energy for next week â€“ all low seas and northerly winds! We had to have four days off â€“ wa too long! Tomorrow is low wind and low seas around 2 m, weâ€™ll aim for Port Orban, 50 km, nothing in between to land safelyâ€¦! Iâ€™m confident Josh will be up for this challenge without another sea sickness attackâ€¦he performed great in the rough stuff today, as an experienced white water paddlerâ€¦probably better that Iâ€™d doâ€¦ ðŸ™‚ .end
