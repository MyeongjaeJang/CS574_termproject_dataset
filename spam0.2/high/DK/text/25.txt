The Turkish Embassy in Denmark, located in Østerbro near the border with Hellerup, was attacked last night by people throwing Molotov cocktails. 
The embassy building sustained slight fire damage and no-one was injured. Police believe that up to four perpetrators were involved. 
“We had a patrol in the area and the officers pretty much witnessed it. They saw at least two people flee the scene,” Henrik Moll, a spokesperson for Copenhagen Police, told TV2 News.
