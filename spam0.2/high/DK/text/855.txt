Indie developer CHainsawesome Games are hard at work on their upcoming asymmetrical 3-on-3 multiplayer game Aftercharge , in which a team of invisible robots faces a team of invincible guards. 
Now they've announced that not only is the game coming to Nintendo Switch, but it will offer cross-play between Switch and the previously announced PC and Xbox One platforms. 
"Having Aftercharge support cross-play with the three platforms at launch has always been super important for us, so we can't wait to see the three gaming worlds collide this summer," said Laurent Mercure, Communications Officer at Chainsawesome Games, via press release. " Aftercharge on the Switch not only makes the game playable on-the-go, but also opens the door to building a more unified gaming community without platform-based borders." 
The developer has plans for a playable alpha test in April and they'll also bring the latest build of the game to PAX East where a couple of new characters will be premiered.
