Hori Joy-Con with d-pad for Switch out in July But only in Japan. Text: Markus Hirsilä Published on the 22nd of Mar 2018 at 14 
Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu has revealed on Twitter , that peripheral company Hori will release a Joy-Con with a proper d-pad for the Nintendo Switch this July, but only in Japan. 
This new Joy-Con has no bluetooth functionality, so it's only usable in portable mode. The simple reason for this is of course that only that way the Joy-Con has a direct contact to your Switch. This Joy-Con will cost 2,400 yen without taxes, which is about £16 or €19. 
Let's hope that this gets a proper release in the West as well. We bet that there are a lot of 2D sidescrolling fans, who would love to play on the go with a proper d-pad, even if this Joy-Con is limited to this use. Famitsu You must be logged in to comment.
