Anthony Joshua ‘AJ’ Beats Parker To Take WBO Title 
by Busybuddies April 1, 2018 
Anthony Joshua (AJ) unified the WBA, IBF and WBO world heavyweight titles after he defeated Joseph Parker of New Zealand at a tense Principality Stadium in Cardiff, Wales. 
The 28-year old Nigerian-born British boxer, who previously held the WBA and IBF titles, was able to fend off the Parker’s impressive durability, movement and use of swift hands. 
Anthony Joshua was almost certain to take the fight especially after he landed a hard left uppercut on Parker in round eight as well as two stinging left hooks early in the 10th. 
Parker thereafter showed some fighting spirit in the 11th but it was too little to late as he was handed his first professional defeat based on a unanimous decision. 
Joshua won via the scorecards, which read 118-110 118-110 119-109 though Parker deserves some credit for taking Joshua to points win for the first time in his career. Related
