Sega revealed that a bunch of classic Sega Mega Drive and Sega Master System titles will be released on Nintendo Switch under the Sega Ages label. More than 15 games will eventually make their way to the console, 5 games were already revealed during Sega Fes, an event for Sega fans in Tokio: Sonic the Hedgehog, Phantasy Star, Thunder Force IV, Gain Ground and Alex Kidd. 
Studio M2, known for the re-release of the Sega 3D Classics Collection on the Nintendo 3DS and Sega Ages titles on the PlayStation 2, is responsible for the Sega Ages games on the Switch, which will all come with added features. 
The release of classic titles on de Switch, which other publishers like Capcom and SNK have also been doing, does, however, suggest that Nintendo hasn't got any immediate plans for a Virtual Console service on the Switch. 
The first Sega Ages games will be released this summer in Japan. You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now ! Ã—
