New The Banner Saga 3 trailer reacquaints us with Bolverk You may well remember him from the second game. Text: Sam Bishop Published on the 18th of Mar 2018 at 09 
The Banner Saga 3 is coming our way later this year, but for now we'll have to make do with trailers, including the most recent one that introduces us to one of the key characters in the game, called Bolverk. 
"While most giants are content with their lot in life, Bolverk starkly rejects his ancestry," the trailer tells us. In fact, he's one of the last remaining Varl giants, and just so happens to be mercenary leader of the Ravens too, although if you've played Banner Saga 2 you won't need reintroducing to him.
