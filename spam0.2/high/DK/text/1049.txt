Anyone setting foot inside Chocing Good’s factory in the Dutch city of Dordrecht, near Rotterdam, will have no reason to mistake the business’s core product. The nutty fragrance of dark chocolate is unmistakable and everywhere you look there are stacks upon stacks of molds that are used to make the confectionary. Owner Conny Augspurger showcases the whole system, where the melting of the chocolate is the only mechanical part of the course. Items that are to be recreated are put in a polycarbonate mold. The hardened molds are then filled with chocolate, put in a freezer and when cooled, the chocolaty goodness gets given a finishing touch with edible paint. Advertisement
