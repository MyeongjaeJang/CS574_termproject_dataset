Indie developer Sumo Digital, the studio behind Sonic & All-Stars Racing: Transformed and Little Big Planet 3, has announced that it's the first anniversary of their retro-inspired physics platformer Snake Pass, and to celebrate this they are releasing The Snake Pass: Arcade Mode Pack, a free update for PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, which turns Snake Pass into a time-based score attack game. 
Play through all the 15 levels of the story, unlock Arcade Mode for each level, and eat as much fruit as possible to earn huge scores, rack up massive multipliers and beat your friends to the gate before the time runs out. 
"We could not think of a better way of passing on our thanks to all of our fans, who have played Snake Pass over the last year", said Seb Liese, creator of Snake Pass. "The Arcade Mode Pack, introduces a new way to play, as you compete with friends across global leaderboards to see who can be the world's slickest slitherer!" 
In addition to the free update, the game itself will receive a 50% discount on Nintendo Switch eShop, Xbox One Store, and Steam from March 27th to April 10th! 
Happy birthday, Snake Pass!
