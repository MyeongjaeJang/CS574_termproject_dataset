Cliff Bleszinski is calling out his former employer, Epic Games, on Twitter, accusing them of trying to hire away his staff, and trying to squash other Battle Royale-inspired games, like Boss Key's new project, Radical Heights . 
In a series of tweets Bleszinski says: 
"Hey @epicgames, could you please stop trying to hire away my team? We just launched @Radical_Heights on UE4 and are really happy with how it's going." 
"There's room at this genre for more than a few games SMH." 
And in reply to another Twitter user he says this: "We have plenty of ways to make it our own but they may never see the light of day if they keep doing this" . 
Boss Key has had some trouble lately, just two weeks ago they announced that they were putting further development of Lawbreakers on hold, and in December the co-founder of Boss Key Productions, Arjan Brussee, left the company in favour of Epic Games. 
It's clear that Bleszinski needs a win, and he isn't keen on Epic "ruining" things for him by allegedly poaching his employees. What do you think of the situation?
