Mannequin Janice Dickinson is telling a jury that Invoice Cosby raped her after giving her a capsule he claimed would assist her with menstrual cramps. 
Dickinson is the fourth accuser to take the witness stand at Cosby’s intercourse assault retrial in suburban Philadelphia. She informed jurors Thursday she was “rendered immobile” by the capsule as Cosby acquired on prime of her in his Lake Tahoe, California, lodge room. 
Dickinson was 27 on the time and says she felt vaginal ache. After waking up the subsequent morning, she says she observed semen between her legs. 
Prosecutors are calling Dickinson and different accusers to the witness stand to point out the 80-year-old comic has a historical past of drugging and molesting girls. 
Cosby is charged with sexually assaulting a lady at his house in 2004. He says it was consensual. His first trial led to a hung jury.
