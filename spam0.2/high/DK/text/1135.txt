Fortnite gets v3.4 Content Update with Vending Machines But you don't need to update the game this week. Text: David Caballero Published on the 5th of Apr 2018 at 08 
Via a new official post, Epic Games has informed users of a couple of new features and schedule changes coming to Fortnite and its extremely popular Battle Royale multiplayer mode. 
The v3.4 Content Update doesn't mean a new title update, and that's the first change, as from now on "every other week we will drop new content without the need for an update". The idea is for developers to spend more time (a fortnight, no pun intended) on fixing glitches and deeper issues, but without halting the weekly content drops. 
The other main new feature is the vending machines in the Battle Royale mode, which spits out loot in exchange for materials.
