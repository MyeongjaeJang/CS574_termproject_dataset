The Switch has proven itself to be a popular console throughout the world, and now VG247 has reported that it has sold over four million units in Japan, as revealed by statistics on ResetEra for the week ending March 25. 
These figures were revealed by the firm Media Create, and indicate that the console is just as popular in Nintendo's homeland as it has been seemingly everywhere else. We've been loving it here at Gamereactor too, so we're pleased to see that it's hit this milestone.
