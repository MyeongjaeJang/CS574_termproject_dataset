Girls’ Frontline is an Anime-styled real time strategy game for mobile devices that sees you commanding an army of mechanical female soldiers in a post apocalyptic world that’s been decimated by World War III. 
In 2045 World War III broke out, causing untold devastation and plunging the world into chaos. With civilization in ruins, private military contractors emerged which used armies of T-Girls – anthropomorphic female soldiers based on real-life firearms from WWII to the modern day. In Girls’ Frontline you take control of one of these contractors (Grifon Military) and lead your armies into lawless areas, fight enemies and hopefully uncover the truth behind what started the war in the first place. 
Girls’ Frontline features fast paced real time warfare, with you managing your formation and tactics during the battles. As you progress there will be over 100 T-Dolls to unlock, each with a variety of customization and upgrade options, allowing you to build a fearsome squad of soldiers. The Beta will run from today at 20:00 PST and will finish on April 11th at 23:59, with spots only available to the first 5000 to join up. So sign up now to join the frontline!
