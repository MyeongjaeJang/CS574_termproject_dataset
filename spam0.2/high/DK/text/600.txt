Supply chain data unifier and aggregator GateHouse Logistics A/S today announces that its ghTrack ® data service has been awarded TMC’s coveted 2017 IoT Connected Transportation Award . 
For more than 20 years, TMC has been honoring technology companies with awards in various categories. These awards are regarded as some of the most prestigious and respected honors in the communications and technology sector worldwide. Winners represent prominent players in the market who consistently demonstrate the advancement of technologies. Each recipient is a verifiable leader in the marketplace. 
“Clearly, GateHouse Logistics is delighted that our ghTrack data unifying service has been awarded the prestigious 2017 IoT Connected Transportation Award,” said Jesper Bennike, CEO, GateHouse Logistics. ”The logistics industry is data hungry and in the years ahead will rely more heavily on IoT technologies for real-time freight data information. Our ghTrack service will be a central platform for all involved in the supply chain.” 
GateHouse Logistics’ ghTrack cloud-based DaaS/SaaS integrates IoT transportation position and sensor data from more than 400 different transportation tracking systems worldwide into a single API that may be easily integrated with business management solutions in order to provide real-time visibility across the supply chain. 
Shippers, manufacturers, carriers, logistics providers and 3PL/brokers that have struggled to gain real-time access to their inbound/outbound freight movements may now subscribe to a single IoT data stream to access millions of assets worldwide, be it from trucks, trailers, containers, ships, rail, or planes. 
GateHouse Logistics has taken data aggregation further than any other company in the industry, including addressing draconian European data privacy laws by developing a unique secure data distribution methodology that ensures that the data provider’s privacy is protected when not operating transport services for the data receiver. 
The clearly defined rules governing use of the ghTrack service allows transport providers and their subcontractors to know exactly what data and when their data is being shared. These rules and a range of thoughtful algorithms are built into the ghTrack data sharing engine to ensure data is only shared with a shipper at the appropriate time. 
GateHouse Logistics’ market position within the supply chain is, as a completely independent and neutral data unifier and aggregator, making ghTrack the ideal solution for IoT logistics visibility, allowing all parties to be protected in their sharing and receiving of IoT transportation data.
