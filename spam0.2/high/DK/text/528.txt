Here's two hours of Ni no Kuni II's late-game side content We explore some spoiler-free side missions. Text: Sam Bishop Published on the 26th of Mar 2018 at 09 
We've covered a ton of content from the opening few chapters of Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom already prior to release, from the battle with Longfang to the mission in Goldpaw, which is why last Friday we decided to do something a little different when we streamed the game, in that Sam used his own late-game save file. 
Have no fear though, because at no point does Sam ever engage with the main storyline in this stream, which you can watch below. Instead he delves into some of the side content, showing you the extra things you get to do in the game, the advanced combat skills he's acquired, skirmishes, Kingdom Mode, and a whole lot more, so if you've been itching to see more Ni no Kuni II but don't want anything spoiled, check this out.
