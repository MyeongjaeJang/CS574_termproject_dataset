The Swedish game studio Fatshark announced today that in a month, more than a million copies of the newly released Warhammer: Vermintide 2 have been sold, which is naturally a very strong accomplishment, particularly given the game has only seen release on PC thus dar. Gamereactor had a chat with Fatshark CEO, Martin Wahlund: 
Hi Martin, how does this feel? "It feels truly fantastic! Very inspiring and this gives us so much inspiration to work on loads of great upgrades." 
How much had the first game sold in the same amount of time? "Just about 320,000 copies." 
Does this mean that we will get Vermintide 3? "You never know... We still have loads of stuff we want to get into Vermintide 2." Related texts
