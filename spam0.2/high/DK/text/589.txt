From 2 April, U.S. customers will be able to get their hands on a BMW via a subscription model. Called Access by BMW, the new service, still in pilot, will be offered only at a specific dealership in Tennessee. 
The Bavarian manufacturer joins the ranks of other brands already offering subscription-based mobility in the U.S., notably Cadillac (Book), Volvo (Care by Volvo) and Porsche (Porsche Passport). 
BMW North America CEO Bernhard Kuhnt first hinted at the programme last January at the Detroit Auto Show. 
Earlier this month, Britta Seeger, Head of Global Sales at BMW's close rival Mercedes, also said that her company was contemplating a U.S. subscription programme. 
Access by BMW is not the manufacturer's first foray into new mobility models. In January, BMW's captive finance arm introduced a flexible lease allowing BMW and Mini owners in California, Oregon and Washington State to share their cars or use them for ride-sharing services.
