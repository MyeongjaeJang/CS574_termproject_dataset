THQ Nordic has just announced a remaster for Red Faction: Guerrilla cleverly dubbed Red Faction Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered. This new version, with improved graphics and higher resolutions, will offer the same experience as in the past, and even includes multiplayer modes. 
The launch date of the title has not yet been revealed beyond a rather vague "second quarter", but we expect more details on that soon. 
Red Faction Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered is expected on PC, PS4, and Xbox One before this summer, so time will only tell how that goes. Is this a favourite game of yours? You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now ! Ã—
