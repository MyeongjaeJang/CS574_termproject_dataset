It was a tough decision to leave out the early morningâ€™s easy wind and swell hours â€“ but the next safe landing from Coquille River is Port Orford, in 50 km distance, which we couldnâ€™t get to without hitting the strong headwinds in the afternoon. So John Schlesinger agreed to pick us up today, which was more than welcome to have a house and lovely hosts for the next four days of likely having off due to bad weather. Four days on a beach in a tent could be longâ€¦ Josh and I just had to pack our gear in the drizzling rain, to drag our kayaks an almost longer distance out over an exposed sand bank (I was sensing yesterday afternoon exactly that, and also that my tent would be rather close to the high tide markâ€¦one or two tiny waves might have sneaked under my tentâ€¦), and to paddle exactly 664 m across to the boat ramp in the harbor. My longest paddle on this trip! 
Wended up in Marthaâ€™s lovingly decorated house, all rooms with a collection of artwork of all kinds. I love my bathroom downstairs -like right from the beach! The afternoon was filled with logistics and phone calls, but we decided to go out play-paddling tomorrow morning from Sunset Bay, to get Josh even more chance to get used around the beautiful reef to the new kayak and paddle and â€“ and the swellâ€¦ ðŸ™‚ Usually, I like to stay dry on my days off, but this time I think it might be fun! Morning hours are not to bad winds, it will become nasty later in the afternoonâ€¦
