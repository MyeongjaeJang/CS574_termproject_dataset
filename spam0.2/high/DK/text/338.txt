Developer Hazelight and Josef Fares are now ready to launch their co-op only action-adventure, A Way Out . Publishing duties are being handled by none other than Electronic Arts, and so to mark the game's coming launch on PC, PS4 and Xbox One on March 23, we are now getting an official launch trailer. 
The game tells the story of two men who are escaping from prison, and as expected, it's not going to be a smooth ride. Our review of A Way Out is coming in the very near future. Check out the official launch trailer right here and tell us in the comments whether you and your co-op buddy are looking forward to taking a closer look at Hazelight's debut title. Related texts
