Legendary developer Will Wright returns with Proxi It's all about the subconscious.   16 
Will Wright is one of the most well-known developers of our time, but it's been a long time since we've heard from him. He was part of the development team who made Spore back in 2008, and now he's back, announcing his new game Proxi during Unity's keynote at GDC 2018. 
Proxi will be released sometime in the future for mobile platforms, and is set in a subconscious mind. Here players can interact with "their own memories", and apparently learn from both themselves and the memories of other players. Also, the game seems to learn from the player, as Wright describes; "While players will learn about themselves, "[the game] will learn about you. This is, in some sense, a game of self-discovery, a game where we uncover the hidden you." 
Proxi is currently being developed by Gallium Artists, but spearheaded by Wright. Does the concept sound intriguing? Related texts
