James McAvoy and Bill Hader in It: Chapter 2? Set to hit theatres next year. Text: Magnus Groth-Andersen Published on the 15th of Apr 2018 at 13 
Last year marked the premiere of the new It movie based on Stephen King's novel, and this remake was a massive success both critically and commercially. It is, however, only the first part, as it's been known for a while that a second chapter will show the kids now as adults, battling the terrifying Pennywise again. So, which actors are involved? 
Well, rumors have already circulated that Jessica Chastain might be cast as the adult Beverly, but now Variety reports that she might be joined by James McAvoy and Bill Hader, who are rumored to play Bill and Richie respectively. 
None of the actors have commented on the rumours - the film, entitled Chapter 2, is set to open on September 6, next year. You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now ! Ã—
