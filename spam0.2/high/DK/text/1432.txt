About Video: Normally, a meal would seem like such an ordinary affair in our life. But can you imagine that with the equivalent of a simple plate of food, you could help empower a destitute child with quality education? Sadhguru urges one and all to skip a meal every Wednesday and donate the amount that you would have spent on the meal to Isha Vidhya. With your support, Isha Vidhya can build and run English Matriculation Schools all over rural Tamil Nadu.
