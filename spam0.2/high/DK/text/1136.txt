IOI and Warner join forces on Hitman: Definitive Edition The game will hit retail in a month and a half. Text: David Caballero Published on the 4th of Apr 2018 at 17 
After IO Interactive parted ways with Square Enix a year ago and confirmed a new Hitman was in the works, it looked like all was said and done with regards to the brilliant, episodic Hitman from 2016. However, that isn't quite the case, as the Danish studio has just announced a new partnership that'll see the complete version of the game released physically. The new publisher will be Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, and the agreement means that the game will hit shelves for PS4 and Xbox One on May 18. 
As a nod to two decades of IO Interactive, the new version will add new Agent 47 costumes based on classics such as Kane & Linch, Freedom Fighters, and Mini Ninjas. The disc will include the complete first season (you can read our review here ) alongside all of the post-launch DLC and updates, some of which you'll need to download (depending on your platform, the file size ranges from 12-24 GB).
