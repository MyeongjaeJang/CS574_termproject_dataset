“Our most important goal with Recor Home, our new furniture concept, is to give customers an experience instead of just a showroom where it’s just seat after seat, cupboard after cupboard. That’s why we invest in shop-in-shops where our own interior designers create a whole living environment with our furniture, inspiring people to really think about how they want to furnish their own house. “To get people that far, we think of all the details: from matching carpets to the colours of leather and fabrics, the decoration, the structure of the walls; all that to create a homely feel. With our augmented reality app, you can imagine your living room with the furniture of your choice.” Advertisement
