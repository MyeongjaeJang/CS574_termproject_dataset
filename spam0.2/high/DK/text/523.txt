Legendary fighting game franchise Street Fighter has already dabbled with the world of films, and now Deadline is reporting that a TV series adaptation is coming, with a deal closed already that'll see Joey Ansah, Jacqueline Quella, and Mark Wooding as executive producers. 
These three are the same team behind the live-action series Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist, and this new project will draw on the World Warrior narrative from the games, focusing on Chun-Li, Ken, Ryu, and Guile, all of which will be fighting M. Bison, according to Deadline's report. They will all compete in Bison's World Warrior competition, and this is where their paths will cross. 
"Street Fighter is a global tour de force franchise, having garnered immense worldwide commercial success and built a vast devoted fanbase that has only grown through its 30 year legacy. We are thrilled to be teaming up with Joey, Jacqueline and Mark, who are already so deeply connected to this brand, to bring this adored story to television audiences everywhere," said Mark Gordon, eOne's President and Chief Content Officer for Film, Television and Digital. "A particular strength of Street Fighter is the wide range of ethnically diverse characters and powerful women featured in the game. It will allow us to build an inclusive and engaging TV universe."
