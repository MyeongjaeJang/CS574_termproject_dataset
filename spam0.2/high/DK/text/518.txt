Report: CDPR launching 2 AAA story-driven games before 2021 There's Cyberpunk 2077 and... something else. Text: Stefan Briesenick Published on the 26th of Mar 2018 at 14 
Polish game developer CD Projekt RED recently unveiled a report about the state of the company, dealing with the various parts of their business, and while many were looking for details on their next AAA game Cyberpunk 2077, there was little to be found, although the release frame was scheduled until 2021 at latest. 
On the other hand they did talk about another story-driven AAA RPG several times, which apparently should release as well as Cyberpunk 2077 in the coming years. It's important to note that this isn't the first time we've heard about this yet-unannounced project though, because in 2015 the company revealed its existence to shareholders in a financial report. 
Obviously this unknown game doesn't have to take place in the world of The Witcher, but it still might be the case. Would you like to visit Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher universe again, or experience something totally new?
