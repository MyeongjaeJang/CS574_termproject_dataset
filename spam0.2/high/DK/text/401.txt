On today's GR Live we're exploring Ni no Kuni II Sam is guiding us through some of the side content. Text: Sam Bishop Published on the 23rd of Mar 2018 at 12 
Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom has so far received very good reviews from critics (including us, as you can read here ), and so what better time than today to play the game for two hours on our livestream and show exactly why we love the game so much. 
Sam's here to do just that, and just to let you know how things are going to go down, he will be playing side content from the late game for two hours in an effort to show you the world, the mechanics, and some of the more advanced content, since we've seen a lot of the opening sections already in pre-release and preview material. 
Join us on our live page from 15:00 GMT (16:00 CET) to see Sam in action, and bear in mind that he is the one who reviewed the game too, so you're more than welcome to ask him questions about the game as he's playing. Related texts
