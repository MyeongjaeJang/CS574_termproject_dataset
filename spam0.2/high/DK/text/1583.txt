BMW finally launches its user-friendly solution for charging the high-voltage batteries of electrified vehicles, called BMW Wireless Charging. It provides a cable-free supply of energy from the electricity grid to the car’s battery. The system consists of an inductive charging station (the GroundPad), which can be installed either in the user’s garage or outside in the ground, and a receiving part built into the car’s underfloor section (the CarPad). Power is transferred via an electromagnetic field and the process can be initiated as soon as the car parks over the GroundPad, without the driver having to intervene. BMW is the first carmaker to offer a system for inductive charging of a high-voltage battery. BMW Wireless Charging is available now as an option for the BMW 530e iPerformance.
