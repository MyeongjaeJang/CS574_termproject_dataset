15 minutes of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze The game is coming to the Switch, featuring Funky Kong. Text: David Caballero & Markus Hirsil√§ Published on the 12th of Apr 2018 at 14 
Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze was one of the best platformers on the Wii U (you can read our review from back in 2014 to see why), and now the game is making its way to the Nintendo Switch on May 4, as a lot of older games have done and will do in the future. 
Gamereactor Spain has captured footage from the Switch version of Donkey Kong running at 1080p and 60 frames-per-second. A fair warning is in order though: the game has not become any easier. For this reason we're introduced to Funky Kong, and it may seem like cheating, but it feels great.
