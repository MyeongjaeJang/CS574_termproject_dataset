Star Wars Battlefront II gets Ewoks and microtransactions The battle of Endor arrives just as we get to pay for new skins next week. Text: Eirik Hyldbakk Furu Published on the 13th of Apr 2018 at 17 
Last month, EA and DICE detailed Star Wars Battlefront II 's new progression system and announced that the microtransactions would return "sometime in April". Now we know just when we'll get to pay for cosmetic items, and how they're going to entice us to open our wallets. 
The developers have revealed that we'll get to use real money to buy new skins for playable characters on April 18 and that they're adding more than 50 new appearances as part of the update. Some of these skins include new Endor-themed looks for Han Solo and Leia Organa that can be purchased for crystals or in-game credits. Why? Because we'll get to experience the battle in all its glory as well, as we're getting a new limited time mode next week. 
Ewok Hunt is pretty much what you think it is. One team plays as Ewoks who can use spears, Wisties, and other skills we know from the movies and TV series, while the other team starts as the more well-equipped Stormtroopers. There's an interesting twist though, as each defeated stormtrooper spawns as an Ewok. This continues until every last Stormtrooper has become a lot smaller and hairier, or the empire's troops have survived long enough for extraction team to arrive. Just imagine being the last Stormtrooper against the hordes of Ewoks. Do you like the sound of that? Related texts
