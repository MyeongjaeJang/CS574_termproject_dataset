Picture copyright HoC Theresa Might went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn within the Home of Commons. This is what occurred. 
Voters throughout England go to the polls on three Might in native elections – and this Prime Minister’s Questions gave us a sneak preview of the kind of marketing campaign they will anticipate. It appears to be like prefer it will not be fairly. 
Jeremy Corbyn kicked off by difficult Theresa Might to say if the collapse of Tory-run Northamptonshire County Council was a results of Conservative “incompetence” regionally or nationally. 
It was a type of carefully-crafted PMQs posers that’s meant to place the PM in an not possible place and had Labour MPs baying for a solution. 
Mrs Might merely ignored it and as an alternative declared “Conservative councils value you much less”. 
Mr Corbyn had one other go, highlighting the boasts of Northampton’s Tory chief who had as soon as stated his authority had pioneered the “straightforward council” mannequin, the place as many providers as attainable are outsourced to the personal sector. 
“Does the prime minister consider that the slash-and-burn mannequin for native authorities can be a good one?,” requested Mr Corbyn. 
The PM pointed to a report by an impartial inspector who had stated the council’s issues weren’t all the way down to underfunding. 
Mr Corbyn accused the federal government of “prioritising tax cuts for the tremendous wealthy and massive enterprise” over funding for social care, libraries and bin collections. 
The point out of bins allowed Mrs Might to get in a swipe at a Labour-run Birmingham council’s bin strike. 
She then revealed what she thought was her trump card – judging from the sing-song voice she adopted as she drew her reply out – feedback by Labour’s shadow native authorities secretary Andrew Gwynne, who she claimed needed to cease voters’ potential to dam giant native tax rises whereas additionally backing a land worth tax and a “new resort tax”. 
The Labour chief stated Mr Gwynne did not suppose councils “must be a automobile for privatisation”. He then quoted the Tory chief of Surrey County Council, who stated of council funding “the federal government can not stand idly by whereas Rome burns”. 
Mrs Might switched to a political assault on Labour’s “arduous left”, studying out an inventory of Labour council leaders she claimed had been pressured out. 
This despatched the Commons quantity up – prompting Speaker Bercow to inform MPs to emulate the “Zen-like” calm of Ken Clarke, the daddy of the Home. 
“All of us admire Zen,” noticed Mr Corbyn. 
There have been additional offended exchanges about native authorities finance – and additional makes an attempt by the PM to needle Mr Corbyn about allegations of anti-Semitism in his occasion and the alleged persecution of “moderates”. 
Mr Corbyn threw in a quote from retail guru Mary Portas, a one-time Tory adviser, criticising the federal government. 
However Mrs Might obtained the ultimate phrase, as she at all times does at PMQs, and used it to trumpet the most recent unemployment figures, which she stated have been one of the best since 1975. What else got here up? 
Iain Blackford highlighted hyperlinks between Cambridge Analytica – the agency on the centre of a row over the alleged misuse of private knowledge from Fb customers to affect the US election – and senior figures within the Conservative Occasion. 
“Can I level out that the dad or mum firm of Cambridge Analytica – Strategic Communications Laboratories – has been run by a boss of Oxford Conservative Affiliation,” stated the SNP’s chief at Westminster. 
He added that “hyperlinks to the Conservative Occasion… go on and on”. 
Mrs Might informed MPs: “So far as I am conscious the federal government has no present contracts with Cambridge Analytica or with the SCL group.” 
PM quizzed over Cambridge Analytica hyperlinks 
All of it obtained a bit Carry On for a second, as Tory MP Tom Pursglove requested the PM about plastic espresso cup waste. 
“Maybe if she is round afterwards. I’d be capable to give one to her,” he requested Mrs Might, who appeared to benefit from the double entendre. The Verdicts 
Here’s what Day by day Politics presenter Andrew Neil product of it: 
And right here is Laura Kuenssberg’s verdict: 
What the BBC’s Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D’Arcy product of it: 
Ho-hum. One other scrappy rating draw within the Vauxhall Convention. The PM appeared stunned that Jeremy Corbyn selected to assault on council cuts – and his opening query on the woes of (Conservative managed) Northamptonshire County Council, now successfully bankrupt and really useful for abolition, left her discomforted. 
However as Mr Corbyn pivoted from Northants to Surrey and Leicestershire, Theresa Might recovered herself and began citing examples of quitting Labour council leaders and Labour activists switching to her occasion. Possibly the truth that she had such apparent traces of retaliation accessible to her defined her shock. 
Maybe Mr Corbyn’s handiest second got here when he pointed to the impression of rising enterprise charges – a topic that genuinely worries many Conservatives – however he didn’t press that assault very far. In some ways this was a prototypical Might-Corbyn trade – him: “cuts are unhealthy…” Her: “Labour can be worse.” Parliamentary artistry it is not. 
Maybe essentially the most politically fascinating side of this session was the exchanges on fisheries, The federal government is aware of it’s in a troublesome place over the transitional deal it has struck with the EU. Fishing communities which hoped to see Britain pull out of the Widespread Fisheries Coverage on Brexit Day have been dissatisfied – and infuriated. 
Scottish Conservative MPs, lots of whom would lose their seats if their fisher-folk turned in opposition to them, are deeply anxious and have already expressed their disappointment. There have been discouraged from doing so once more, at present. However the intervention from Brexiteer ex-minister Mark Francois demonstrated that it isn’t simply constituency curiosity that drives backbench Tory disquiet; there are many Tories who’re very dissatisfied on ideological grounds – and are placing down markers in opposition to a longer-term compromise of fishing rights after the transition. 
The PM got here ready with a carefully-worded reply on this subject, however she is aware of it is not going to go away, and that she faces an actual dilemma, as a result of the electoral value of failure on this subject might be a reverse of these very important Tory positive factors in Scotland. 
The SNP’s Drew Hendry cashed in on Tory discomfort, however his Chief, Ian Blackford, raised the Cambridge Analytica saga, detailing the hyperlinks between the corporate and Conservative Occasion figures. The PM didn’t take pleasure in that – and it might have been Mr Blackford’s handiest second at PMQs since assuming the SNP’s Westminster management. What pundits are saying on Twitter
