Did Phil Spencer confirm backward compatibility for next Xbox? In some ways, he already did back in 2016. Text: Magnus Groth-Andersen Published on the 13th of Apr 2018 at 15 
Under Phil Spencer's reign, backward compatibility has almost become a staple of the Xbox console's identity, and therefore many are expecting it to make a return on future hardware. That's just not just the fans though, Spencer himself has now stated that Microsoft has learned a lot from introducing backward compatibility, and that has impacted "future plans". 
Spencer wrote the following on Twitter : 
"I'm always learning, it's key for me. I've learned a ton from the response to X from gamers and studios, trust me that this learning is impacting our future plans." 
This, of course, mirrors the sentiments expressed by Spencer as Microsoft introduced Project Scorpio and declared the end of traditional console cycles at E3 2016. You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now ! Ã—
