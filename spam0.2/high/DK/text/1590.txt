Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice lands on Xbox One Ninja Theory's adventure gets a new audience. Text: Sam Bishop   15 
We already knew that Ninja Theory's Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice was coming to Xbox One this month, and now it's here, and can be enjoyed by a whole new audience of gamers using not only the Xbox One, but also the expanded power of the Xbox One X as well. 
For those who don't know, Hellblade gathered critical acclaim last year for its approach to dealing with mental health, and the touching story it told as we followed Senua through her quest. If you want even more reason to play it, though, there's a brand new trailer below as well.
