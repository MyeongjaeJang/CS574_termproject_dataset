“You may think you already know English Gin but we urge you to look again. In an era where the majority of gins are produced using industrial processes unrecognisable to early distillers, we believe that the ‘True English Gin’ style is worth championing, preserving and protecting”, Christopher Hayman, fourth generation master distiller. In a time where most gin producers have focused on what is new, the current Hayman family members remain stead-fastly focused on championing the ‘True English Gin’ style developed by their parents, grandparents, great-grandparents and great-great grandparents. In 1863, James Hayman’s great-great grandfather launched his first London distillery. His ‘London Dry’ style became a runaway success, and a 150 year family passion for ‘True English Gin’ was born.
