Microsoft and Capcom have finally released the long-awaited Xbox One X patch for Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, and that means that players with Microsoft's powerful console can now experience the survival horror game in 4K and 60 FPS, along with HDR support, so the horror can be even more real. 
The patch also improves the details on the faces of the characters in the game by using "Screen-Space Subsurface Scattering". The update is available on Xbox One X and weighs 445 MB, and if you're sceptical you can check out the game on Xbox One X in comparison with the Xbox One S in the video below.
