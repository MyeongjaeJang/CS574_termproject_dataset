Learn about the mythology, music and voices in God of War The complete soundtrack is now on Spotify. Text: David Kers   11 
God of War is releasing this Friday (April 20) for PlayStation 4 and to get us warmed up for the occasion Sony has released a couple of videos detailing different aspects of the game's development. 
In the first video music producer Peter Scaturro guides us through the process of creating a new score which reflects the Norse setting of the game. In the second video composer Bear McCreary delves a little deeper into the creation of the score (which you can hear over on Spotify ). 
"I took my memories of that classic God of War soundtrack - the deep choirs, pounding drums, and shrieking brass - and reinvented them for a Norse age", says McCreary. "I wrote new themes, and introduced to the music exotic instrumentation and languages from various Northern European folk traditions." 
In the third video creative director Cory Barlog discusses the influence of Norse mythology on the game and the "human lessons" these stories try to tell us. Finally, in the last video, we're introduced to the Brazilian voice actor, Ricardo Juarez, who became the voice of Kratos in Brazil.
