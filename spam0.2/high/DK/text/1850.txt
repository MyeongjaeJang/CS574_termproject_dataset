Xiaomi Mi 6X aka Mi A2 is expected to be launched on April 25. But ahead of its formal announcement, detailed specifications and features have now been spotted through leaked firmware. The smartphone recently passed through China’s TENAA and is so far rumoured to come with an 18:9 display and a dual rear camera setup. It is now also reported that the Mi A1 successor will not include a 3.5mm headphone jack. 
Folks at XDA Developers have obtained some firmware files that are claimed to be related to the Xiaomi Mi 6X. The firmware files reveal that the Mi 6X will come with a Snapdragon 660 SoC with a clock speed of up to 2GHz. Also, the build properties of the handset point out that there will be a microSD card slot for expanding the built-in storage. It is reported that the handset will feature an LCD panel, instead of an OLED panel. The display panel is already expected to be 5.99-inch in size and come in an full-HD+ (1080×2160 pixels) resolution. Further, there will be an IR blaster on the smartphone to enable universal remote control features. 
Apart from the basics, the Mi 6X is spotted to include a dual rear camera setup with a 12-megapixel Sony IMX486 sensor with an f/1.8 aperture and 20-megapixel Sony IMX376 sensor with an f/1.8 aperture. On the front, the handset has a 20-megapixel Sony IMX376 sensor with an f/2.2 aperture and a front-facing flash. It is also said to support 4K video recording at 30fps frame rate. The front camera will include a Portrait Mode, though the rear camera will not have optical zoom, as noted from the firmware files. 
The firmware files additionally confirm that the Mi 6X will run MIUI 9 based on Android 8.1 Oreo. There will also be an AI lens feature to enhance image results. Of course, in its Mi A2 avatar, we can expect it to run stock Android. 
If we look at the details surfaced on the TENAA listing, the Mi 6X will come in three configurations with 4GB RAM/ 32GB storage, 6GB RAM/ 64GB storage, and 6GB RAM/ 128GB storage. It is also expected to pack a 2910mAh battery and measure 158.88×75.54×7.3mm. Besides, the early images of the Mi 6X confirmed that the new Xiaomi smartphone will not carry a notch, which is quite common in many mid-range Android devices nowadays.
