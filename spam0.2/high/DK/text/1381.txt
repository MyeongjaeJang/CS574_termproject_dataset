You control time and not characters in The Gardens Between We talked to The Voxel Agents' Matthew Clark at PAX East. Text: Mike Holmes   16 
One of the games we stopped by to look at during PAX East was The Gardens Between, a puzzle game that has a rather unique twist. 
"You don't actually control the characters at all, you just control time," developer Matthew Clark told us in Boston. "So you just move time backwards and forwards, and that's basically how you solve puzzles." 
"It follows the story of two best friends, they're next door neighbours," Clark explained of the story. "They've run away from home and during a storm they're transported into this surreal strange world. It's a bit Alice in Wonderlandish, and it's like very surreal, you're never really sure if they're actually there or whether it's just a bit of a dream."
