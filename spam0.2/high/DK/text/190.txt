Here's a fan-made Labo Man character for Super Smash Bros. It couldn't be weirder than we Wii Fit Trainer, right? Text: Magnus Groth-Andersen Published on the 21st of Mar 2018 at 10 
Way back when, Nintendo introduced quite a bizarre character to Super Smash Bros for Wii U, the Wii Fit Trainer. This was not only amusing, but also a way to promote different Nintendo products through the magic of Smash Bros, and if one fan gets their way, that very same thing should happen in the upcoming Super Smash Bros. for Switch. 
YouTube user Javed L. Steritt, has revealed quite the ingenious way to promote Labo through the upcoming game, and that's via the character Labo Man. As envisioned by Steritt, LaboMan is a speedy little devil with a range of attacks based off of the Labo equipment set to release next month, and Steritt released a few pieces of art as well as a nifty little demonstration .
