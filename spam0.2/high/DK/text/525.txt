Arcade Punch-Out!! to release on the Nintendo Switch It's the very first time it'll leave arcade, and will even include vertical screen option. Text: David Caballero Published on the 26th of Mar 2018 at 11 
Even though the NES, SNES, and even the Wii got great iterations of the arcade boxing game Punch-Out!!, none of them got the original arcade game, which is considered the very best version; a cult classic in fact. The Switch is about to change all that though, as a new Japanese announcement reveals that this is getting an imminent release on the Nintendo Switch, under the so-called ACA series, ports handled by Hamster that include Neo-Geo and other Arcade Archive classics, releasing digitally on the Nintendo eShop. 
The 1983 original, which was designed by Genyo Takeda , had the peculiarity that it was played on a vertical format screen, something that has been kept as an option for this version, as you can tilt your Nintendo Switch in handheld mode to keep its spirit alive, as unveiled by Famitsu . 
The action is actually displayed on two square screens (one for the scoreboard and the other one for the ring), so players can decide whether they want to arrange them next to each other or in the original vertical layout.
