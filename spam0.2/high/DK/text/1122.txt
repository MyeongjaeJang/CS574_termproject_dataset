After several leaks and rumours, Activision has finally officially announced Spyro: Reignited Trilogy, an HD collection that includes the first three chapters of the saga starring the iconic purple dragon. This collection, developed by Toys for Bob, includes Spyro: The Dragon, Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage! and Spyro: Year of the Dragon, all in high definition, for a total of over 100 graphically updated levels with improved controls. 
The launch, as suggested by the most recent retailer leak, has now been confirmed as September 21, but it will not be an exclusive for PlayStation 4 as some initially speculated. Spyro: Reignited Trilogy will actually arrive on both PS4 and Xbox One. 
Also, on the occasion of its twentieth anniversary, starting on Monday, April 9, Crash Bandicoot: NSane Trilogy players in Europe, Australia and Latin America on PlayStation 4 will be able to insert the iconic code (↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → square) on their controller in Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped's title screen to watch the Spyro: Reignited Trilogy trailer. 
Finally, in a move that will no doubt please diehard fans, Tom Kenny, who voiced Spyro in Ripto's Rage! and Year of the Dragon, will return in Spyro: Reignited Trilogy. Related texts
