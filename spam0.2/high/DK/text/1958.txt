Ninja Theory struck a chord with many people when it released Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice on PC and PS4 last year, and so it was only a matter of time before the studio looked to expand its audience and release the critically-acclaimed game on Xbox One. That happened last week, and now it's time for us to take a peek at the game and see how it looks in 4K on Xbox One X. 
So join us on GR Live at 3pm BST / 4pm CEST to see us play through a two-hour section of this thought-provoking title, and see whether it's a journey you'd like to take now that Hellblade has made the jump to Xbox One. Related texts
