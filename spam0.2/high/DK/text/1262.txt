God of War will be among us in just over two weeks and fans are looking forward to Kratos's next adventure, this time set against a backdrop of Norse mythology. Although there's plenty of hype surrounding Santa Monica Studio's game, there are also some who didn't appreciate the changes made by the studio compared to the previous chapters of the franchise, even threatening to cancel their pre-orders. 
Recently game director Cory Barlog replied to these criticisms and, through Kotaku , he advised disgruntled players to try God of War before judging it, because he says much has been kept secret in order not to spoil surprises for players: 
"I know there are a lot of people who are out there saying, 'It's totally different. They're changing a lot of things. Hashtag Not My God Of War. Hashtag Cancel My Pre-Order,'" Barlog said. "But I think a lot of people have to play it." 
He then added: "We've been very restrictive of the information and what we're showing visually, and part of that is my paranoia. I want people to experience this game as a whole. Everybody who made this game - or a good portion of this team - has been a part of God of War from the very beginning. Nothing has changed cynically or under pressure or just willy-nilly. All of us put a lot of heart and soul into this game, and the DNA of what this franchise is still pumps through the blood of this game." 
We have to wait until April 20th to find out how God of War shapes up, when it lands on PS4. Related texts
