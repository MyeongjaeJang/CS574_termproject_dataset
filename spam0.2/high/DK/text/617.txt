Tera 's open beta on console took place earlier this month, and it seems like Bluehole Studio and En Masse Entertainment were very happy with the results as they've announced that the game is ready to launch on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. 
We're told that Tera will make its way to PS4 and Xbox One on April 3. Can't wait that long? Then you can buy the free-to-play game's Founder Pack for $29.99 to get some extra goodies and access to it today. This announcement came with this short trailer that shows a few glimpses of how the game will look on console. 
Do you think Tera will be a hit on PS4 and Xbox One as well? Related texts
