Space Hulk: Deathwing gets PS4 launch date It'll release in two months on PS4 and PC, while the Xbox version is seemingly canceled. Text: David Caballero   08 
Publisher BadLand Games has just announced that Streum On Studio's tense FPS from late 2016, Space Hulk: Deathwing , will get an Enhanced Edition on May 22, 2018. This new edition will mean its debut on consoles, but the only platforms mentioned in the announcement were PlayStation 4 and PC, and it seems as though the Xbox One version was canceled sometime since the last time publisher Focus Home Interactive publically discussed the game (which looks like E3 last year). 
Based on Warhammer 40,000 universe, the new edition includes all sorts of extras and upgrades, among them a new class of Chaplain, new weapons, different enemies, and special missions. The Enhanced Edition will be a free upgrade for existing owners of the game on PC. Related texts
