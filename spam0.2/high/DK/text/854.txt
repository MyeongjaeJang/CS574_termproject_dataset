Frontier Developments has released the Planet Coaster Studios Pack for their theme park simulation, which adds three new rides: Big Screen Tour, electric buses that work as transport as well as a tracked ride; Re-Motion, a tracked simulation ride with video screens; and Horror Heights, a drop-down tower. 
Besides the rides the Studios Pack introduces hotels, that can boost the number of guests, as well as path tunneling, a tool that lets players create tunnels and paths through hills, mountains and caves much easier. 
The Planet Coaster Studios Pack is available for £7,99 / €10.99 on PC. Check out the trailer and some screenshots below. Related texts
