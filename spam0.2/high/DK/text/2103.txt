CircusFest celebrates the future of circus: daring and diverse, punky and poetic. ðŸŽªðŸŽŸ 
From the spectacular to the intimate, the festival showcases the point where circus collides with theatre, dance, live art, film and even virtual reality. 
Always innovating and evolving, circus has come a long way since its beginnings. 2018 marks the 250th anniversary of the invention of modern circus, by entertainment entrepreneur Philip Astley. His show was a hit, and a new art form was created. 
Founded in 2009, CircusFest is Londonâ€™s biennial international festival of contemporary circus taking place at the Roundhouse and partner venues across London.
