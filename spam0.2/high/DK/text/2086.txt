Dark Souls: Remastered on Switch hit by delay The portable port will instead dodge and roll onto Nintendo's console this summer. Text: Mike Holmes   15 
The Switch version of Dark Souls: Remastered has been officially delayed, with Bandai Namco reaching out today with the news that From Software's pleasingly punishing action-RPG will instead be gracing Nintendo's hybrid console sometime this summer. 
No reason was given for the delay, nor were we offered a new release date (it's still heading to PS4 and Xbox One on May 25), although it was confirmed that the release of the Solaire of Astora amiibo has also been pushed back and it will land around the same time as the game. 
For those of you looking forward to lighting fires and dodge-rolling around hideous creatures on Nintendo Switch, all we have to soothe you is some over-the-shoulder footage of the game running on the hybrid console. Check it out below. Related texts
