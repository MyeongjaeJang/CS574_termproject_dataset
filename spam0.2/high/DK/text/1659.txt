Fortnite gets a portable fortress Here comes Port-A-Fort. Text: Markus Hirsil√§ Published on the 12th of Apr 2018 at 09 
Epic Games' Fortnite has proven to be a runaway success, even passing its closest competitor PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds in many places, but the game is constantly being improved and expanded, and perhaps something game-changing has just arrived now. 
Fortnite's Battle Royale mode has just received a new grenade called the Port-A-Fort, which is just what it sounds like: a portable grenade that produces a fortress instead of an explosion. This is of course a quick way to make yourself a defensive position against other players, and seemingly negates the challenge of quickly building yourself a fort once things get heated. 
Do you enjoy building things in Fortnite, or do you just prefer showing your dominance over other players by shooting them? Related texts
