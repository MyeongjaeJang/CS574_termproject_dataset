Ubisoft continues to work hard on its tactical shooter Rainbow Six: Siege, and now we have the patch notes coming to the PTR, as revealed on Reddit , which you'll be pleased to know tones new operator Lion down a little bit. 
Lion's scan, for instance, will no longer be effective in case of immobility, and on top of that his charges have been reduced from 3 to 2 and the reloading time has been lengthened from 10 to 20 seconds, so hopefully this should change how often he is used right now. 
Another important point has also been corrected: the Weapon Sight Misalignment. This problem consisted of a viewfinder defect that will soon be a thing of the past, as shown by Ubisoft in a demonstration video . 
There are the usual amount of bug fixes too, as you'd expect. Have you had issues with Lion? Related texts
