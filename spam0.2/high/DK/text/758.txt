Tiny Metal is an Advance Wars-inspired turn-based strategy war game which was released on PC, PS4, and Switch in December last year, and now developer Area 35 has announced that they will be unveiling a highly-anticipated free multiplayer update to Tiny Metal at PAX East on April 5-8. 
The new mode which is coming as part of this update will be shown to press only, ahead of its planned release in May 2018. We currently don't know anything else about the update though, other than that it's coming, but we will keep you updated as soon as news start to trickle out of PAX East.
