Akwa United have moved into second place behind leaders Kano Pillars on the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) table following their 2-1 home win over 10-man Heartland in a rescheduled Matchday 10 clash on Wednesday evening. 
Francis Momoh gave the visitors a 20th minute lead before goals from Ifeanyi Ifeanyi and Haggai Katoh either side of halftime overturned the defeat in Akwa Unitedâ€™s favour. 
Heartland finished the game with 10 men after Nnamdi Egbujor was sent off in the 63rd minute to all but end hopes of getting a result. 
The win takes Akwa United (22 points) to second spot while Heartland stay in the relegation zone (18th spot) with 13 points. Related
