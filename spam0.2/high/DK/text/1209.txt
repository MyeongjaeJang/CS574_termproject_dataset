Chemours' new distribution centre in DeLisle, Missisippi is more than five times the size of an NFL football field and the 300,000 sq. ft. facility is used for storage and distribution of titanium dioxide. And it is the most recent addition to the DSV - Chemours cooperation. No small feat 
The DSV project team defined goals and success criteria, developed a project management plan and broke it into smaller tasks to ensure that all stages of the project were successfully completed on time. The plan included evaluation of the facility layout, custom fitting of the interior in the newly built facility, IT system implementation and, finally, inventory relocation from the three former warehouses into the new facility.
