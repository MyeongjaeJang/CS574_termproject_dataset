Diesel 
A petrol engine that is as fuel efficient as a diesel but costs less? It is possible, Volkswagen claims, thanks to the new micro-hybrid powertrain of the Golf. It is based on the new 1.5 TSI petrol unit, which already had the capability to shut down two of its four cylinders at low loads to safe fuel. When combined with the DSG, the new micro hybrid can actually shut down its engine entirely and disconnect the transmission while coasting, saving up to 0.4/l100 km. 
VW has yet another trick up its sleeve: the 1.5 TSI ACT BlueMotion, as it is called, makes use of the Miller combustion process combined with a variable turbo charger. All technical tricks combined, VW reckons a 10% enhanced fuel efficiency over comparable petrol engines. The VW Golf's combined CO 2 emissions are rated at 110 g/km, its maker states, but that's measured according to the old NEDC method. The correlated (WLTP-derived) NEDC value will probably be a few grams higher. 
The highly-efficient TSI will find its way to other VW products soon. In the future, it will also be combined with 48V and high-voltage batteries to create mild and full hybrid powertrains, respectively. Even CNG belongs to the possibilities, making the new TSI a promising new engine on many levels. 
That being said, diesel is not dead yet, according to Volkswagen. At the eve of this years Geneva Motor Show, the brand's CEO Matthias Mueller stated diesel would see a renaissance in the not-too-distant future because people who drove diesels would realise it was a very comfortable drive concept (click here to read the article).
