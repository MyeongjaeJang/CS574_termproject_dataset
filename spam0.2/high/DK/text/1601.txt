We dive into Extinction for two hours Our mighty hero meets even mightier Ravenii. Text: Sam Bishop   10 
Yesterday we published our review of Iron Galaxy Studios' Extinction, which sees you take on colossal giants as you try to stop them stomping citizens into the ground, and yesterday we also took to the livestream to try the game out for a few hours as well. 
If you missed our escapades on the stream though, don't worry, as you can watch us battle the beasts in the replay video below, where DÃ³ri becomes the hero we always knew he could be. Have you had a chance to try the game out yet? Related texts
