Fortnite's servers are down today An interruption that could be longer than the previous ones. Text: Islem Sharouda Published on the 29th of Mar 2018 at 11 
Fortnite has been in the spotlight recently, whether that's from its record sales numbers or streaming events , the most notable of which is obviously the Ninja stream with Drake, but today's news is something a little less fun. 
Through the game's Twitter account developer Epic Games has warned players that Fortnite's servers will be down for maintenance today, March 29, to introduce the v3.4 patch into the game: 
"We are targeting a 4am ET (8 GMT) release on March 29 for the v3.4 update NOTE: There will be extended downtime for this update." 
It should be noted that an extended downtime has been mentioned, which suggests that this maintenance may last longer than usual, although we know that we'll be getting a new weapon in the form of a Guided Missile, a video of which you can see below.
