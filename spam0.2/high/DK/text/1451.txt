What sort of world does the new American right envision? Guest researcher Jean-Francios Drolet contributes to the WoR-project Print 
Jean-Francois Drolet, from the University of Queen Mary, London, has joined the WoR-project team at DIIS as a guest researcher. In Copenhagen for most of April, Jean-Francios will be contributing to the weekly WoR-seminars with his deep knowledge of conservative traditions of thought in the US, France and Britain. During his stay, he will also present a paper on “America First: Trump and American Paleoconservatism”. 
Of interest to a broader audience, Jean-Francios will be back at DIIS to present his take on the new American right and its visions of international order at a public seminar on May 17.
