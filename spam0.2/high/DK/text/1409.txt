Brazil Countering the effects of pollution that car emissions bring to our atmosphere is a key part of vehicle management, especially in regions such as Latin America where electric vehicles are still quite expensive to acquire. One group addressing the issue is multinational vehicle leasing and fleet management company ALD Automotive. Under its CO2 compensation program which started in 2012, the company is planting thousands of tree saplings in the Brazilian state Sao Paulo, home to the largest metropolitan region in Latin America. This year, the company has reached 200,000 trees.
