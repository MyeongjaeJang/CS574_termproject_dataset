The Elder Scrolls Online: Summerset set for early summer See what we did there? Text: Markus Hirsil√§ Published on the 22nd of Mar 2018 at 15 
The Elder Scrolls Online was released back in 2014, and it has been expanded ever since. And the game just keeps on expanding. 
On May 21, for PC and Mac, and on June 5 for PS4 and Xbox One, the latest expansion The Elder Scrolls Online: Summerset is coming. Players get to explore the home of the High Elves in the Isle of Summerset. It is time to "reunite with old friends, and unravel a shadowy conspiracy that threatens all of Tamriel". 
New features include for example: 
A new zone, Summerset Isle A main story quest line, concluding the narrative that began in the ESO base game and continued through Clockwork City Join the Psijic Order, and explore their island home of Artaeum Learn a Psijic Order combat Skill Line Master a new Jewelry Crafting Skill Line Face the challenges of Cloudrest: a new 12-player Trial Take on new group PvE challenges 
Pre-purchase is available already, and by doing so you will get Queen's Bounty Pack, and immediate access to the Nightmare Senche Mount. You will also get a bonus copy of the Morrowind Chapter, but only via digital pre-purchase. 
If you just can't wait, you can already start by playing Summerset prologue quest and "help Vanus Galerion investigate a report of a mysterious prophecy". This can be done by getting the Mage's Message Stone for free in the in-game Crown Store. By completing this prologue quest, you will get the Wyrd Elemental Plume memento. Some hoops to jump through then, but that just comes with the territory.
