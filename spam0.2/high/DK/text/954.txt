‘Buhari is a failure, don’t vote him in 2019’ Obasanjo tells Nigerians By 0 SHARE 
Former President Olusegun Obasanjohas once again berated the Buhari-led administration, warning Nigerians ‘not to reinforce failure by re-electing ineffective and incompetent government come 2019.’ 
The former president who sent an explosive letter to President Buhari in January advising him not to run for a second term in office, blasted the government again when he spoke while receiving the Chima Anyaso led New Nigeria group at the Olusegun Obasanjo presidential library in Abeokuta, Ogun state yesterday Monday, April 2nd. Speaking, the former president said”Never you reinforce failure. Let failure be failure. And if you do not see what you should see, you will then be a victim of what you don’t like because it’s only when you see what you should see and you do what you should do that you put away what you do not like. Those of you who are into business know that by now you could have been better if we have an effective government. The truth is this – when you have an ineffective and incompetent government, we are all victims and don’t let anybody deceive you.” he said The former president added that it was uncharitable for the present government to keep speaking about challenges three years into their four-year term. He also advised Nigerians to ignore the apology and reform claims made by the opposition party, PDP. ”Stop giving excuses; we met challenges. If there were no challenges, then we wouldn’t need you to come. You came in because you know there were challenges… stop giving us excuse that you have many challenges, that is why you haven’t achieved results. I have publicly said and I mean it, that as a party, neither PDP nor APC can get us there as they have been. Never mind about reforms and apology and all that.”.
