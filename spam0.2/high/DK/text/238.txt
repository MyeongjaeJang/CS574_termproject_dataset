What`s lacking in the advancement of autonomous car usage is clear legislation, vehicle leasing expert Kent Bjertrup told Global Fleet during an interview . “In some cases, it is unclear as to who or what is responsible when a self-driving car is in an accident. Is it the automaker, the autonomous software, the driver who may be in the car, or something else,” said Bjertrup who is the LatAm regional director for international fleet management company ALD Automotive. Other challenges that need to be addressed is finding ways to reduce the chance of someone hacking into the car’s system and other control issues such as which of four cars will go first at a busy intersection, and creating a standard system in which all OEMs will be synchronized with each other. These and other questions have been on the minds of many this week following a fatal accident involving a self-driving car in Tempe, Arizona in the United States. It is reported to be the first ever accident of its kind in the country.
