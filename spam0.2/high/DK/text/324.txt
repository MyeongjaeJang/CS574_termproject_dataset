Via their blog developer Mojo Bones has announced that Impact Winter , released in May last year on PC (check out our review , even if it should be said that the game has been updated plenty since), is coming to PS4 and Xbox One on April 5. Impact Winter is a different sort of survival experience, with a lot of focus on narrative and team management as you try and survive until rescue arrives. 
"We are both intrigued and excited to know what you, our new console audience will make of the game, and eagerly wait to hear and see your impressions." Related texts
