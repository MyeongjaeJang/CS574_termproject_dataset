Ubisoft & Danny Wallace look at Far Cry-esque religious groups Including those in East Grinstead. Text: Sam Bishop Published on the 25th of Mar 2018 at 16 
Far Cry 5 is all about a secret religious organisation, one centered around the mysterious figure known as 'The Father', and now Ubisoft has released a new video that's all about their own adventures with comedian Danny Wallace to look at the religious groups of East Grinstead. 
You can watch the video down below in which Wallace seeks to uncover what's so special about the town and why it has attracted these religious groups, and while he doesn't always get the desired answers, it's still a good way to prepare yourself for the upcoming release of Far Cry 5 on March 27.
