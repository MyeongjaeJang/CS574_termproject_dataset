The use of electric vehicles (EV) and hybrid cars are on the rise in Brazil, but at a very slow pace, vehicle fleet management expert Maria Baldin told Global fleet. “In addition to the cars still being quite expensive, recharging infrastructure is practically non-existent in the country,” said Baldin who is the general manager in Brazil for multinational car fleet management company ALD Automotive. Despite this, ALD is set on being a pioneer in the business. Besides keeping abreast with the latest technologies, we are currently carrying out tests to use these vehicles in collaboration with Chinese EV manufacturer BYD , the executive said. It is just a matter of time until EVs start to make an impact in Brazil and the rest of Latin America.
