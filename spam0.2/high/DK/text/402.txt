Yesterday we reported that developer Behaviour Interactive had reached an agreement with their publisher Starbreeze Studios to regain full control of multiplayer hit Dead by Daylight . Today they've released a roadmap of what's ahead in the coming year for the game and it seems that the team which has swelled from 30 people to 75 with the success of the game has a lot in store for us. 
Here are some bullet points of some of the things Behaviour has planned: 
4 new survivors 4 new maps A new progression system allowing players to unlock non-licensed survivors and killers by playing actively New paid cosmetic items that won't impact the gameplay with most of them unlockable by playing too, whether you play a lot or more casually. A new ranking system for a more meaningful, more inclusive and more rewarding progress. A new deployment process to trial new features and content on PC first, using PTB, meaning we can push it to all platforms as soon as it feels ready, rather than as soon as we can. An anti-cheat reinforcement to help make Dead by Daylight a better place for all players. A tutorial mode to improve new players' onboarding and allow anyone to brush up their skills before going into ranked games. Better tools to handle toxicity Dedicated mid-chapter patches to make sure the content is as clean as possible, to look at some of the balancing element, but also to add quality of life improvements and polish when needed
