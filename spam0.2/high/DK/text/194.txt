Video game based on Narcos announced Heading to PC and console next year. Text: Jonas Mäki Published on the 20th of Mar 2018 at 18 
Popular movies and TV series becoming video games are of course commonplace, still, we didn't expect Netflix's slow-paced crime drama Narcos to be taking that step. Yet that's exactly what's happening, as publisher Curve Digital now has announced. Kuju will be doing the development and the studio boss Brynley Gibson had the following to say: 
"We're looking forward to creating a game that matches the fantastic storyline and gritty action of the Netflix series. We're tremendously excited and have some amazing gameplay elements in the works that will please both fans of the show and gamers." 
So far, media haven't been shown the game, which is planned to launch during spring 2019 for PC, PlayStation 4, Switch and Xbox One. Pablo smiling about yet another good business opportunity - video games. You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now ! ×
