Centipede Mini Arcade Cabinet revealed by Replicade Funstock's pre-orders are open right now. Text: Sam Bishop Published on the 25th of Mar 2018 at 11 
Retro gaming fans listen up, as Funstock has revealed the Mini Arcade Cabinet from Replicade, which as you may be able to tell from the name is a miniature wooden cabinet that recreates the classic title Centipede but with the nostalgic arcade experience... except a lot smaller. 
The cabinet stands at 12 inches tall, but it's fully playable and the iconic control systems have all be reproduced in 1:6 scale. As if this wasn't good enough, the cabinet itself is decorated in Centipede art straight from Atari, and features a 3.5inch LCD screen (4:3 aspect ratio), custom made trakball and buttons, as well as a USB-rechargeable battery. 
This is just the start for manufacturer Replicade though, as they're planning to bring more classic arcade titles back in cabinet form, so keep your eyes peeled for future announcements. You can pre-order the Centipede Mini Arcade Cabinet right here for £129.99 if you're interested though, which should make the wait for the next cabinet announcement that bit easier.
