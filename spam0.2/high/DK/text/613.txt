news Netflix to make live-action Carmen Sandiego movie The voice of the new Carmen Sandiego animated series will play the titular character in the live-action feature. Text: Suzanne Berget Published on the 27th of Mar 2018 at 14 
Last year Netflix announced that they were making an animated series about the criminal mastermind and elusive nemesis of the ACME Detective Agency, Carmen Sandiego, where Gina Rodriguez (Jane the Virgin, Annihilation) will be the voice of the titular character. Originally born in 1985 Carmen Sandiego has seen multiple video game releases, but it's been a while since the last one. Perhaps, the Netflix revival will usher in her comeback there as well. 
Now Deadline can reveal that Netflix is also planning on making a live-action movie about the character, with Gina Rodriguez playing the lead. The movie is to be a standalone Carmen adventure, and has no director or writer as of yet. Gina Rodriguez herself will produce the movie, alongside Kevin Misher and Caroline Fraser through her production company, I Can and I Will productions.
