Call of Duty: WWII gets Dunkirk map in War Machine DLC Here's a video showing what's to come next week to PlayStation 4. Text: David Caballero Published on the 5th of Apr 2018 at 14 
Below you can watch the new trailer for War Machine, the second DLC drop for Call of Duty: WWII, the highly successful shooter by Sledgehammer Games and published by Activision. 
The main new feature is the trio of new maps included in the pack: Dunkirk, Egypt, and a rocket facility in Germany. It also adds Operation Husky as new War Mode mission, for which Sledgehammer asked Raven Software for some help on. 
Last but not least (indeed, it's the most important news for some), the Nazi Zombies mode is getting a new chapter, and it's called Shadowed Throne. 
The content lands on PS4 first as usual, on April 10. Then it'll also come to PC and Xbox One a month or so later. Related texts
