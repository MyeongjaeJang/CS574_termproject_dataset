Hazelight Studios, the Josef Fares led studio responsible for the co-op only adventure A Way Out has announced on Twitter that the recently released game has sold more than one million copies in just over two weeks on the market. 
"We just found out that #AWayOut has sold over 1 million copies, in just over two weeks! Words cannot describe how much this means to us. Thank you to all of you for your support!" 
Josef Fares, who retweeted the announcement, added that this means that there are two million players out there, seeing as the game is only playable in co-op and each sold game allows for a second player to play the game without having bought the game.
