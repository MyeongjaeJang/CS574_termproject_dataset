“Van de korrel tot de borrel,” laughs owner Jean-Paul Batenburg. Roughly translated, this means ‘from the grain to the drink’, highlighting the company’s strong involvement in all aspects of production. “It’s our signature. To us, the most important thing is quality, so we don’t use artificial ingredients like flavourings or dried fruit. Instead, there are three people peeling 100 kilogrammes of fruit twice a month and our botanicals are carefully selected from various suppliers around the world.” Only the best available is good enough. Of course, the story does not stop there. The Maltwine is also homemade, in a process perfected by the master distillers of Onder de Boompjes. Advertisement
