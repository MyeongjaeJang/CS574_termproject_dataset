Far Cry 5 sells faster on Steam than Assassin's Creed: Origins A lot faster. Text: Jonas MÃ¤ki   12 
Assassin's Creed Origins was a huge hit for Ubisoft and a return to glory for their series, selling twice as much as its predecessor Assassin's Creed: Syndicate did during its lifetime. It's still going strong, in fact, and is being bolstered by more and more additional content. 
Impressive, but not as impressive as Far Cry 5, it would appear, as the fifth instalment was released two weeks ago and has sold a lot faster than Assassin's Creed Origins on Steam. According to SteamSpy , the former has currently sold 741,547, while the latter is at roughly the same amount (743,601), although it needed five months and several sales to reach that. 
We rather enjoyed Far Cry 5, as you can tell from our review , so we think it's a deserved accomplishment. Would you agree? Related texts
