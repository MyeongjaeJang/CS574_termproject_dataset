Future God of War games will be based on Norse mythology "We want to stay in the Norse universe."   16 
The upcoming God of War is taking a massive risk by introducing fundamental changes to the series formula and by ditching Greek mythology and instead basing the game on the Norse mythology. While first impressions are positive, it seems Sony Santa Monica are pretty certain of the success of this thematic change, which is why future titles will also be based on Norse mythology. 
This was revealed by Santa Monica's Aaron Kaufman during an interview with PlayStation Lifestyle , where he said: "This God of War is Chapter 2 of Kratos. We know right now, we want to stay in the Norse universe, we want to explore this relationship between a father and a son." 
This short statement also seems to hint that Atreus will play a role in this new era of God of War. Do you think sticking with Norse mythology is wise? Related texts
