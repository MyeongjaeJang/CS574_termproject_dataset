Rumour: PlayStation 5 unlikely to release next year Plans can change fast though. Text: Jonas Mäki   12 
There have been a ton of rumours lately regarding the PlayStation 5, with some sources even claiming it might launch this year. Others say 2019 is more likely, while some say 2020, but Jason Schreier from Kotaku - who's known to have good sources in the gaming industry - has just posted a piece saying that he has talked to "dozens of game developers" (some even working for Sony) and only two of those said they knew something about PlayStation 5 and Sony's plans. 
Both sources allegedly claimed the new 'console' is unlikely to be released next year, but add that plans can change fast if a competitor like Microsoft makes a surprise move, and one of them said: "On a multi-year project, a lot can happen to shift schedules both forward and backward. At some point, Sony's probably looked at every possible date. It's all about what they think is the best sweet spot in terms of hardware." 
Schreier points out that the very same developers hadn't heard anything about Xbox Two either, which likely means that it's still a way off. Schreier sums it up by writing: "There is information about the PlayStation 5 floating around at both first- and third-party companies, but it's far more limited than it would be if the console's release was imminent." 
That means we'll likely get to enjoy the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for quite some time and don't have to think about new consoles for perhaps up to two years. Is that what you want to hear? You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now ! ×
