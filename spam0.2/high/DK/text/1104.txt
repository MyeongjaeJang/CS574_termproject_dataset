Uber 
It will only be a matter of weeks before Uber, Lyft and Waymo will start testing self-driving cars on Californian roads without an operator being on board. The West-coast state has passed a bill that allows fully automated vehicles to be driven with the driver seat empty or even without a steering wheel. This paves the way to driverless robo-taxis and indeed very cheap transport. 
As a safety precaution, Californian law requires the driverless cars to be monitored remotely at all times, at least during the test phase, in which passengers can try out a self-driving car for free. Should a problem occur, the operator has to be able to intervene. That remote operator must also be able to communicate with the police as well as the people aboard the vehicle in the event of an accident.
