Compact in size and surprisingly large in storage capacity, Secrid wallets fit every pocket, and are available in an array of elegant styles and colours. Merging fashion, industrial design, functionality, and form, they allow for the ideal daily accessory. With such a slick design and a patented mechanism that allows for sliding out cards in one simple motion, it is no surprise that production rapidly increased from 10,000 wallets in 2012 to one million in 2017. From the start, Secrid has designed in a way that ensures local production is possible. Founders Ren√© van Geer and Marianne van Sasse van Ysselt admit that many people thought they were crazy when they initially discussed working with the manufacturer Made In Holland Leather, which has become a key link in the 200-member Secrid production chain.
