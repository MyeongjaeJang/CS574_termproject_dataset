Louis Smolka’s MMA career started on the fast track by winning the Pacific Xtreme Combat title just one year after going pro. 

He caught the attention of the UFC and was shortly be signed to them. From there he had a total of ten fights in the Octagon against top flyweight contenders such as Ray Borg, Ben Nguyen and Tim Elliot, collecting two performance of the night bonuses and one fight of the night bonus. 

In his last four fight with the UFC, he found himself in the hazardous area of free agency, suffering consecutive losses in the midst of contract negotiations. The promotion opted not to resign Smolka, but he believes a couple wins at the regional level could get him back on one of the bigger stages in MMA. 

In his commitment to getting back his career on track, he has uprooted his life, moving from Hawaii to Irvine, California and has focused on a new diet, sans partying and joined a new gym at Team Oyama. 

He has announced his first fight back will be against Ralph Acosta at Gladiator Challenge on Saturday, April 21 in Palm Springs at Agua Caliente Resort and said “I’m trying to be the guy I said I was three years ago when I got in the UFC and do things seriously. I’m trying to just be who I am in the gym when I fight and we’ll see if it works”.
