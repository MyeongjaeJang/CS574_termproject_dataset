Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice coming to Xbox One in April With some visual enhancements for Xbox One X owners. Text: Eirik Hyldbakk Furu Published on the 26th of Mar 2018 at 12 
Earlier this month, we noticed that Taiwan's rating board had rated Ninja Theory's Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice for the Xbox One, but the studio didn't want to confirm anything when we reached out for a comment. Now we know that they kept quiet because they were preparing for the official reveal. 
Ninja Theory has announced that Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice will make its way to Xbox One on April 11, and that Xbox One X owners will get to choose between three different visual enhancement options. 'Enhanced Visuals' will offer extra FX and visual quality; 'High Framerate' will obviously let you enjoy the game at 60 frames per second, and 'High Resolution' will run the game with dynamic resolutions up to 4K. There's even some incentive to buy or pre-order the game before April 18, as this will earn you a 10% discount from the regular price of Â£24.99.
