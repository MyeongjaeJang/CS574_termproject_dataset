Raging Justice getting brawl mode Side-scrolling beat 'em up looks to knock out players with a nostalgic right hook. Text: Mike Holmes Published on the 17th of Apr 2018 at 14 
We caught up with developer Nic Makin in Boston, and there he talked us through his studio's upcoming classically-inspired side-scrolling beat 'em up, Raging Justice. 
As you can see in the screens included with the interview below, the game has a very particular art style and the studio is referencing some real classic titles through its visuals, which is something that we discussed during our talk at PAX East 2018. Similarly, the beat 'em up design, particularly the co-op gameplay that has friendly fire switched on by default, also harkens back to the side-scrolling brawlers of yesteryear. 
We also discussed the recent announcements surrounding the game, with a new character reveal as well as the announcement of a different way to play the game: "We've got the standard story mode," Makin explained, "but we've also added a brawl mode where you have one life. Waves of enemies come - see how long you can last." 
Raging Justice is heading to PC, PS4, Switch, and Xbox One on May 8. Related texts
