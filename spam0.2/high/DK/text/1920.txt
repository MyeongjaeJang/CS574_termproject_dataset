Thor 3's director is still working on the Akira film "I haven't really started to get my head around it yet." Text: Petter Hegevall Published on the 15th of Apr 2018 at 17 
We've known for a while that Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi was working on a live-action version of Akira, and while we've not heard about this version for over a year now, a new interview Waititi did with Dazed Digital reveals that it hasn't been scrapped. 
"I haven't really started to get my head around it yet," he said. "What I wanted to do was an adaptation of the books, 'cos a lot of people are like, 'Don't touch that film!' and I'm like, 'I'm not remaking the film, I want to go back to the book.' A lot of the people freaking out haven't even read the books, and there are six gigantic books to go through. It's so rich. But (the anime) Akira is one of my favourite films; my mum took me to see it when I was 13 and it changed my life." 
If you don't know, the Akira manga was created by Katsuhiro Otomo and takes place in a future version of Tokyo - Neo-Tokyo - in 2019, following the leader of a bike gang trying to save his best friends.
