Xbox Game Pass losing nine titles from its catalogue this month There's a discount on them right now though. Text: Magnus Groth-Andersen Published on the 21st of Mar 2018 at 14 
While Xbox Game Pass just gained one hell of a game in Sea of Thieves, it's also set to lose a few soon, as Microsoft has announced that Kyub, Roundabout, A World of Keflings, Comix Zone, Hexic 2, Jetpac Refuelled, Ms. Splosion Man, Stacking, and The Maw are all getting the boot. 
These games will leave the service on March 31, and they've been available since the summer of 2017. Currently, though, Game Pass users will get a 20% discount on a direct purchase on each of the nine titles, so that's a little something if you still really want to play them. 
There's currently no firm structure in place to predict what leaves the service when, so who knows what could be next. Will you miss these games though? Related texts
