Today on GR Live we're playing Tera on console The MMORPG has made its way to PS4 and Xbox One.   11 
Tera has been doing the business on PC for years, and now Bluehole Studio's MMORPG is spreading its proverbial wings and taking aim at the console crowd. It's a free-to-play game so the barrier to entry is pretty low, but of course these games ask for something more precious than money: your time. And that's why we're going to play the MMO today, so you can see it in action and decide whether or not it's a game that you'd like to spend your spare time playing. So head over to GR Live at 3pm BST / 4pm CEST to see Sophia play through the early game, and let us know if it's one that you're going to check out now that it's out on PS4 and Xbox One. Related texts
