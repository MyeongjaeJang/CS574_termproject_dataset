“Signed by 25 lawmakers, the petition – which calls for banning the ambassador’s return to Jordan – was delivered to parliament’s general-secretariat,” Al-Saud said. 
When asked by Anadolu whether the petition’s signatories wanted to sever all diplomatic relations with Israel, he replied: “Yes, that’s what we want.” 

Last Wednesday the Jordan government announced its agreemen t to receive Amir Weissbrod, the new Israeli ambassador nominated by the Israeli government. 
The Israeli embassy in Amman was closed in July 2017 after one of its guards killed two Jordanians in an apartment belonging to the embassy. 
Last month Anadolu said Israel agreed to compensate the victims’ families and proscecute the security guard , paving the way for the embassy’s reopening and the return of the ambassador. 
In the wake of last summer’s killings in Amman, Jordan demanded that Israel replace its then ambassador, Einat Schlein. Share this:
