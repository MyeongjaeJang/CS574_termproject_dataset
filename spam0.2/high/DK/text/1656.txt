Is Capcom teasing a new character for Street Fighter V? A curious image has emerged on Twitter. Text: Markus Hirsil√§ Published on the 12th of Apr 2018 at 11 
Capcom has released a teasing photo on Twitter that appears to be teasing something, talking about a "test subject" who has "proven to be a suitable clone," as you can see in the image below, and this may even be a DLC character coming to the game tomorrow. 
The folks over at Shoryuken think that all this points to Falke, but of course we don't know anything for sure yet, although we hope an official announcement will be made soon to stop us guessing. 
What do you think the tease is? Related texts
