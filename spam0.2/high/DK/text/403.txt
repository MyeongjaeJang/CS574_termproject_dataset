Daybreak just got in touch to tell us that H1Z1 players who are enjoying the in-beta Auto Royale mode have a couple of new additions to entertain themselves with. As part of the first big update for the game since it left early access a few weeks ago, the Auto Royale mode will now have a duo playlist, where two players (instead of four) can jump in a car and tackle 59 other pairs. Daybreak also added a guided rocket launcher, which should make things a bit more explosive. Head this way for the full patch notes. Related texts
