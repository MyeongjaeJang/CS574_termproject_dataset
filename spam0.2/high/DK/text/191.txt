Survival horror game Agony has been delayed After a March 30 release date, we don't know when we'll get it. Text: Magnus Groth-Andersen Published on the 21st of Mar 2018 at 09 
While only a mere nine days away from release, the ambitious survival horror game Agony from Madmind Studios has been delayed. The game was supposed to release on March 30 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, but has now been delayed indefinitely to allow for more polish time. 
The announcement of the delay was made on the game's Kickstarter page , and while no new date has been announced, Madmind promises that it's all about that extra layer of polish: 
"With Agony being released across PS4, PC and Xbox we are facing last steps including polishing to support every player- no matter which platform - with the best possible experience. We wish this could have been done faster but ask for your patience to ensure you get the experience you deserver[sic] when Agony is released."
