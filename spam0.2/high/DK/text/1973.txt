Valkyria Chronicles is coming to Nintendo Switch, with the announcement made by Sega during Sega Fes 2018, which took place in Japan just this weekend. 
The RPG, which originally released on PlayStation 3 in 2008, will be released this autumn in Japan on the Nintendo eShop and it will include all of the downloadable content available for the game. The game's European release date is yet to be announced. 
Valkyria Chronicles takes players to a fictional region, based on Europe during the early years of World War 2, where players take control of the Gallian Militia in a battle against the East Europan Imperial Alliance. 
Sega also announced news regarding the newest game in the series, Valkyria Chronicles 4. The Nintendo Switch version of the game has been delayed, and now it will miss the summer window and launch in Japan in the autumn. Related texts
