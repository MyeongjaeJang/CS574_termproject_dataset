Epic Games: Cross-play between PS4 / Xbox One ''inevitable'' CEO Tim Sweeney calls it the "next logical step". Text: Stefan Briesenick Published on the 26th of Mar 2018 at 09 
During last week's GDC (Game Developers Conference) Epic Games' CEO Tim Sweeney talked about cross-play between Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One console - a hot debate that has resurfaced many times in recent years - and portrayed an optimistic future for both sets of fans. 
"I think it's inevitable now," he says. "Games have become social experiences in the same way that Facebook or Twitter have, and these experiences only really make sense if gamers can communicate with all of their friends." Sweeney referring to that "one remaining barrier" as "the next logical step" to succeed in business is something gamers will no doubt appreciate too. 
As we already know, Microsoft and Sony do support cross-play between console and PC in various ways, but when it comes to cross-console-play between these two ecosystems, things don't look as good. In recent years Microsoft hasn't hidden their willingness to talk with Sony about that matter, who on the other hand focuses on their own business and maintaining their momentum.
