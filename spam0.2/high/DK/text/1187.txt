Rasmussen will meet with heads of government in all three countries – Germany, Spain and Portugal – to discuss the EU without the United Kingdom. 
“The friendship and partnership between Denmark and Germany is in a class of its own. It is essential for Denmark, Danish industry and Danish jobs. 
“Germany is also a natural focal point for Europe. That’s why we must ensure that Danish perspectives are relevant for the new German government and that our priorities are understood, not least in relation to the future of the EU,” the PM said via a press statement. 
Rasmussen will meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Thursday before travelling to Lisbon, where he will be hosted by Portuguese premier António Costa. He will meet with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain in Madrid next Friday. 
“Denmark will lose an important ally when the United Kingdom leaves its chair at the EU. That’s why we must adapt, reach out and develop the partnerships we have with EU countries who share our interests,” Rasmussen said. 
“For example, Spain and Portugal are both, like us, strong advocates of free trade and open markets, and it is this agenda we – particularly at the current time – must promote in the EU and globally,” he added.
