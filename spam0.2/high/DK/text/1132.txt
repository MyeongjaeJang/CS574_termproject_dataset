Today on GR Live we're playing Owlboy on Switch We're taking another look as the game approaches its release on PS4 and X1. Text: Mike Holmes Published on the 5th of Apr 2018 at 10 
We were rather taken with Owlboy when it launched at the tail end of 2016 (you can read our review here to find out why), and the game has subsequently landed on Nintendo Switch where it proved an excellent fit. It's that version of the game that we're going to be playing today on GR Live at 3pm BST / 4pm CEST , ahead of the coming launch of the game on PS4 and Xbox One. 
So join David as he gets stuck into D-Pad Studio's excellent platformer, and let us know if you're thinking of picking this one up when it finally makes its way to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Related texts
