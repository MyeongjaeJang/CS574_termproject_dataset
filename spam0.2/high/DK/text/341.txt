Over one million pirates take to the Sea of Thieves in 48 hours Rare's open-sea adventure is proving popular, but not everything is going swimmingly. Text: Jonas MÃ¤ki Published on the 22nd of Mar 2018 at 09 
Have you tried to play Sea of Thieves but found yourself unable, or have you faced problems with missing rewards or items? You're not alone. There have been a lot of players roaming Rare's digital seas and in a developer update , Rare has shared its view of the game launch so far. The problem comes from over one million different accounts playing the game during the first 48 hours. 
Rare's studio head Craig Duncan says that "at one point our service engineers told me we had 5,000 people coming in per minute. That's just massive compared to what we prepared for". They are now working to increase the server capacity and Duncan added: 
"We do appreciate all the patience, we do appreciate the support. Believe me, it is as frustrating for us as it is for anyone that's experiencing an issue. We wanna get to an end state where everyone has a good time all the time every time they play." 
Have you encountered any Sea of Thieves problems so far, and did you expect this many people to play the game?
