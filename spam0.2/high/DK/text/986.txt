Compared to Q4 2017, Tesla has increased the production output of its Model 3 by 40 percent in Q1 2018, to nearly 10,000 units. The smallest Tesla now represents nearly 30 percent a third of the brand's total production. This ratio is expected to quickly grow to over 50 percent, Tesla reckons. 
"We were able to double the weekly Model 3 production rate during the quarter by rapidly addressing production and supply chain bottlenecks, including several short factory shutdowns to upgrade equipment", the official statement reads. 
"In the past seven days, Tesla produced 2,020 Model 3 vehicles. In the next seven days, we expect to produce 2,000 Model S and X vehicles and 2,000 Model 3 vehicles. It is a testament to the ability of the Tesla production team that Model 3 volume now exceeds Model S and Model X combined. What took our team five years for S/X, took only nine months for Model 3."
