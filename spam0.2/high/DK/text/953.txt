Before I went back to work (6 1/2 months ago!), I had started sewing a tiny patchwork quilt. It had gone a bit wrong and ended up spending some time in storage. I dug it out to unpick the broken bit and repin it in the hope of getting a bit done over Easter. When I got it back out, I realised I’d already done that at some point (should I worry that I can’t remember????) and it just needed some sewing to finish. 
So… guess what I did tonight? I still can’t sew though, but it’s acceptable for a first attempt. Well, I think so anyway! The original plan was to crochet around the outside, but the best way I think of to do that is to sew a blanket stitch around. And that isn’t happening tonight! Share this:
