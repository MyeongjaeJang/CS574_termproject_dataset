“Of course, I already knew it was happening, but when I saw it with my own eyes, I couldn’t believe it,” says Heine of the time she witnessed an employee take out seemingly fine looking fruit to the back of the supermarket in 2015. The fruit was not rotten, but it no longer looked perfect. “When I asked if I could take it with me to make new products, I was referred to the store manager, who was very positive about the idea. From that moment on, we started to collect the fruit every week.” Along with a friend, Joep Weerts, Heine started to make jams and chutneys, using and combining the leftover fruits. Advertisement
