Many of us have been dreaming of new versions of Shenmue and Shenmue 2 for modern consoles and PC for a long time, and we've heard rumours of it actually happening since 2012. Now it's finally happening. 
Sega has confirmed that the remastered collection that simply enough is called Shenmue I & II will launch on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One later this year. They've done this with a trailer that shows off some upgraded textures, improved screen resolution and an updated user interface. We're also told that we'll get to choose between modern and classic controls, as well as English or Japanese voices. The collection will cost $29.99 when it arrives, which seems like a very nice price for the beloved games. Now we just have to see if this means that Shenmue 3 will be delayed to 2019, or if we'll get to go straight into the third game after playing this collection. Related texts
