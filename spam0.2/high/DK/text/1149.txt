The German fan and electric drive manufacturer Ziehl-Abegg puts the spotlight on bionics: This time a marine mammal is the idea behind a new fan development. “My colleagues have clearly underlined their position at the forefront of bionics and as leaders in fan technology,” emphasises Peter Fenkl, chief executive officer at Ziehl-Abegg SE. The innovative fan ZAbluefin increases efficiency by up to 15 per cent.
