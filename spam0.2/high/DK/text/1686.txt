God of War's video review is here for you to watch It's a great adventure for a number of reasons. Text: Sam Bishop   16 
As we explained in our written review that dropped today, God of War on PS4 is a great return for Kratos, even though it has taken some of what the series has been known for and changed it a little bit, even giving him a son and a beard to carry with him on his journey now. 
If you don't want to read that though (we can't imagine Kratos has time for reading either to be honest) you can always watch our video review, which gives you the ins and outs of why Kratos' latest journey is such a great one, so be sure to check that out if you're interested in the game. 
Is this a game you're excited to get your hands on? Related texts
