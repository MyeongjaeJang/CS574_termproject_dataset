Dell markets new laptop by promoting use of PUBG plug-ins It's a bold tactic that has been accused of encouraging cheating. Text: Petter Hegevall Published on the 15th of Apr 2018 at 14 
PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is obviously a hugely popular game, and with popularity comes cheaters, as noted by PC PowerPlay . Chinese gamers are among the most prevalent cheaters, and while the developers are trying to minimise the blatant cheating in-game, other companies seem to be taking advantage of this in their sales pitch. 
When marketing their new gaming laptops containing Intel's new Core i9-processing chip, Dell told gamers in China that it would be able to run way more 'plug-ins'... which are also known as cheats. PC PowerPlay spoke to Dell spokeperson Sally Zhang, and this is the gist of Dell's pitch: 
"She spoke of how Chinese gamers are the most innovative and dominant in the world by using "plugins" to, for example, run faster than other players, or blow up ten cars at a time, and that these top gamers can really use 8th-Gen power to "run more plugins to win more at Chicken Dinner", and that the top players run the most 'plugins' so that's where 8th-gen Dell power gives them the gamer's edge. Behind her a video proudly shows various cheats in PUBG in action (they really like the one with the massively oversized gun and show that a lot), with the new Dell gaming laptops shown every few seconds while Sally told us that gamers should buy a Dell because they're better at running many plugins. Wow." 
This is a bold strategy to say the least. What do you make of it? Related texts
