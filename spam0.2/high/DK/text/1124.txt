There's a new way to buy your digital PC games. Razer today announced the global launch of its new digital platform for PC games, called Razer Game Store , which is now available worldwide after a beta test period. Using the store players can purchase games which will then be offered via Uplay and Steam. 
In addition, for each purchase made, the platform rewards its customers with loyalty credits called zSilver, earned through purchases made with a credit card. It will also be possible to purchase games using a currency called zGold, which guarantees zSilver and more significant rewards. In addition, when players make their purchases through Razer Game Store, they will have access to exclusive offers, Razer Game Store vouchers, discounted RazerStore peripherals and other benefits. 
At launch, the store will only be available in the United States, the UK, Germany, and France, with content, pricing, payment methods, and localised customer support. As for the rest of Europe, they will have an English version of the store with prices in euros. For non-European countries, however, the site will always be in English with USD prices. 
Among the companies that sell their games on Razer's platform, we noticed Ubisoft, Bethesda, Bandai Namco, Deep Silver, Rockstar and many others. At the launch of the platform, Razer announced a partnership with Ubisoft, thanks to which the players will be able to buy titles like Assassin's Creed Origins and South Park: The Fractured but Whole with discounts up to 75%, but for more information you can check this link . 
In addition, Razer's customers will also have access to offers on four games every week, called Razer Exclusives. For the first round of this promotion the company is offering Far Cry 5, Assassin's Creed Origins, Ni no Kuni II: Revenant Kingdom, and Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus with discounts up to 50%, but their purchase also includes a coupon for Razer Game Store up to $15, double zSilver, and a $10 voucher on Razer devices purchased on the store. 
Finally, those who are among the fastest to register will be able to get one of 10,000 Steam keys for indie gem Furi.
