Cooking can be a hard skill to pick up on, but it is well worth it! The following article will give you some helpful tips on how you can go about cooking amazing quality meals. 
Give pre-cut, raw potatoes a cold water bath for a half-hour prior to frying for crispier French fries. The fibers of raw cut potatoes that have been soaked in cold water prior to hitting the deep fryer, are stronger and can handle the heat better without breakage. 
When cooking with skewers, be aware of some important facts. Not all metal skewers are created equal; traditional round metal skewers are not the best option to keep food in place when grilling. Choosing skewers with a different shape can be the secret to keeping your food from the bottom of your grill. 
Do you know how long your meat should be grilled? A meat thermometer can give you a precise temperature, reassuring you that the meat is fully cooked. If you have thick meat, more than a inch and a half, close the grill to make cooking time shorter. 
When possible, complete all of the prep work in advance. Try to have the prep work completed before cooking; this is important. When you need to create a meal within a certain amount of time it can be stressful. Try to complete your preparations, so you can avoid scrambling later on. 
By doing this, you will find that you will have fresh fruit for a much longer time. In addition, you’ll get to enjoy out-of-season fruits when no one else can! 
In order to get the most out of your selection of spices, you should store them out of the light and heat. By storing them in excessive light and heat, their shelf life will decrease. Your spices will have a longer shelf life and retain their good taste if stored in a dark, cool spot. You’ll taste the difference in your dishes. 
Take the time and steps necessary to accurately measure any oil used for cooking. This will help you lower the fat in your foods while cooking. Doing this will make it easy for you to keep track of exactly how much oil is being used. Thin Strips 
When you want to cook a roast, but you don’t have much time, consider cooking a bone-in roast. The bone transfers the heat from your oven to the center of the roast, helping it cook far more quickly. When the joint is cooked, carefully cut the meat from the bones and serve. 
Freezing meat will make it more solid, and easier to cut into thin strips. Certain dishes require thin strips of beef, chicken or pork. The meat holds a tighter form when the it is partially frozen making the strips clean cut with out any stretching of the meat. However, always thaw your food before cooking it. 
Keep your herbs and spices in a cool, dark place where they will stay fresh. Storing herbs and spices in a warm location will cause them to lose their flavor. 
When you season a piece of meat, try it out before you start to cook it all. A lot of dishes require you to season the meat with care. After seasoning the meat, do not cook all of it. Cook a small portion first to sample. Once you see how it tastes, you can determine to either cook the remaining meat or adjust the amount of seasoning. 
Any time you are faced with a large amount of leftover turkey, don’t be tempted to throw it in the garbage. Instead, cut it into slices, store it in an airtight container, and place it directly in the freezer. The turkey will be more fresh after a couple of weeks when doing this. It is great in a sandwich or a salad. 
If you want crispier and crunchier French fries, then soak the potatoes in a bowl of cold water for a period of at least half an hour before use. Letting sliced potatoes soak up additional cold fluids reinforces the fibers in the vegetable, so that when you deep fry them, they can better withstand the heat without breaking down completely. 
Put your fresh herbs together in a bunch and use kitchen shears to cut them all at once. This is preferable to chopping the herbs because they will be less moisture laden, making them lighter and fluffier. 
Do you have a difficult time deciding how long you should grill your meat? The best way to figure this out is by using a meat thermometer (a digital one will work best). This will ensure that the inside of your meat is cooked properly. If your meat is thicker than 1.5 inches, consider closing the grill lid to reduce grilling time. 
Allow the food to sit for a little while before serving. Many home cooks do not realize how important it is to let the meal rest. Many of us prefer to simply serve a dish right out of the oven. Eating it so quickly after cooking doesn’t give the juices or flavors enough time to sink down into the meats, or whatever you may be preparing. The flavors intensify if you let the meal “rest” for a few minutes. 
Try different liquids in recipes calling for water or milk to add some new flavors to your meals. For instance, you can use broth, stock, juice or a bit of wine to replace the water in a recipe. Rather than using milk, think about yogurt, buttermilk or sour cream. By using different liquid ingredients in your side dishes, you can increase their flavor and nutritional value. 
It is always recommended that you use a fair amount of salt, when you are boiling water for a pasta dish. This will help season the pasta as it cooks. If you try to salt the pasta after it is already cooked it will not hold the seasoning as well. 
If you’re feeling stressed at the idea of making dinner for the family, consider doing much of the prep work the evening before cooking. You could pre-cut the vegetables, pre-mix the sauce, or even prepare the meat marinade prior to heading off to bed. You will be much less stressed and more ready to cook the next day. 
Buy good-quality knives and other cutting tools for your kitchen. You can save time not having to sharpen or deal with dull knives and sharper knives are safer to use. More accidents and cuts happen due to dull utensils than properly sharpened ones. 
Blot your ground beef with a paper towel before you brown it. This will help to minimize the moisture found on your beef. If you leave it there, the meat will not cook properly. Sizzling will occur. Instead of being seared as it should, the meat may very well steam. 
Do not bake a cake too long or to short of a time. Box times are more of guidelines than the actual time a cake should be baked. This is due to various factors that can make a difference, such as elevation. You can insert a toothpick or even an uncooked, long spaghetti noodle to check the cake to see if it is ready. If the toothpick has no batter on it, then the cake has finished baking. If it does have batter on it, then put the cake back in the oven. 
One great cooking tip is just be flexible and creative; do your own thing. Sometimes its okay to deviate from following a recipe step-by-step. You can add a little of one thing, or take out something else, to suit your tastes and enhance the recipe. Then you can consider yourself a real cook! 
You can make a simple dish much better with seasonings and herbs. For dishes with complex flavors, dried herbs will work. However, stronger, better overall taste is produced by using fresh herbs. Consider planting your own herbs to guarantee a fresh and steady supply. 
Make an impression with your next sandwich by taking your time and spreading your condiments evenly over the entire surface of the bread. A lot of times people rush and only put mayonnaise in the center of the bread. When it is spread out evenly, each bite of the sandwich will be delicious and full of flavor. 
Enhance your culinary experience by doing some preparation in advance. Many ingredients can be prepared a few days before you actually cook the meal for which they’re needed. For certain meals, it is imperative to engage in longer preparation times to yield the best flavors. You may never go back to cooking the old fashioned way once you see how much time advanced prep saves. 
A charcoal grill should be prepared and the charcoal lit ahead of the time you plan to cook. Plan to start preparing the grilling surface about half an hour before you place food on it. They will be perfect when they are ash covered and giving off medium heat. This is the best temperature for grilling. 
Brine is a method that is great when cooking. You can soak meat in a brine before cooking to get great flavors out of poultry. 
Take the temperature of cooking meats with a thermometer. Meat must reach a minimum temperature to be safe. This temperature varies for each kind of meat. If your meats are not cooked to the proper temperature, bacteria can stay alive within the meat and make you and your family sick if they are consumed. 
Here is a fresh take on oysters. You can prepare oysters in other ways than just raw with some drizzled lemon juice. Take opened oysters in shells and place them on broiler pans; cover them with a bit of cream. Sprinkle with freshly grated pepper and Parmesan cheese, and broil until bubbling. You can also prepare oysters by sauteing them. Cover them in some flour and fry them in very hot butter for about two minutes until they appear golden. When you bake oysters do it in their shells. First, place the oysters in an oven-safe dish and top with butter and breadcrumbs. Allow the oysters to bake for between four and five minutes at 425 degrees. Once the butter starts bubbling along with the juice from the oyster, remove from oven and serve them with toasted sliced bread. Fresh Herbs 
To avoid a greasy mess, don’t reheat meals that contain a lot of oil in a microwave. Instead, reheat the meals by baking them in an oven. The heat of the microwave can cause the oil to separate from your other ingredients, since it heats quicker. However, baking in a slow and consistent manner can reheat the entire dish, which can keep the ingredients and flavors cohesive. 
Even a basic dish needs some big flavor, so try to add fresh herbs in your dishes whenever possible. Dried ingredients, like herbs, are acceptable if you are making a complex dish of many flavors. Fresh herbs are preferable because of the more intense flavors that they add to the food. A successful method in ensuring a constant supply of fresh herbs available is to have a tiny herb garden. 
To use up odds and ends of veggies and meats lingering in your fridge before shopping day, throw together a tasty wok of fried rice. Use cool rice from the day before or cook fresh rice with less water that you would normally use. Fry both the meat and vegetables with some oil, then put in the rice. Finish things up by choosing a seasoning, including spices like ginger and garlic, and ordinary condiments like soy sauce. 
There are many varieties of potatoes, but they are not created equal. Waxy potatoes are great for boiling and potato salad but do not work as well for baked potatoes, mashed potatoes or french fries. If you plan on making these types of recipes, you should use Russets potatoes as they are made specifically for these. 
Many people tend to get stressed out when they have to cook for a family gathering, especially if there are going to be a lot of people attending. Instead of leaving things for the eleventh hour, try to have everything ready to go in advance. Your prep work might involve cutting up vegetables, measuring ingredients, and marinading meats. 
Even with no prior skill, cooking techniques can be improved with just a few simple tips and ideas. Armed with these great ideas, the only thing left is to get to kitchen and start cooking! Your cooking inspiration will show through in the amazing dishes you prepare. Bon apetit! 
When you are aware that you have a busy day coming up, prepare some of the dinner ingredients the night before. You can serve a hot, satisfying meal quicker and with less stress if you have it prepared when cooking time rolls around. Mix up a casserole and store it in the fridge, or chop up all the ingredients needed for a stir-fry, for example.
