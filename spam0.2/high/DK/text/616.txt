New Gundam Breaker gets release date It will be the first Gundam game to be released on PC. Text: Suzanne Berget Published on the 27th of Mar 2018 at 12 
Last time we heard anything about New Gundam Breaker was in January when Bandai Namco announced that the game would be coming to Europe sometime during 2018. Now the publisher has revealed exactly when the game will arrive on PS4 and, for the first time ever, PC, and that day will be June 22, 2018, the day after it's released in Japan. 
This game will be a bit different than the Gundam games we're used to seeing here in Europe, but the basic gameplay revolves around beating up incoming hostile Gunplas and using parts to construct your own Gundam. For a little more insight into the game, check out the new trailer below.
