Hearthstone players looking forward to the next content drop don't have long to wait after Blizzard revealed that The Witchwood DLC is launching on April 12. Those who log in to the game during a "limited" period after launch will get three card packs and a random class legendary card, a treat which will no doubt bring plenty of players back to the game even if it's just to play a few hands. 
Then there's the small matter of the pre-purchase offer, which will set you back $50 / Â£45 but get you a 50 card pack bundle as well as another bonus 20 card packs. To find out what those card packs might contain, you can join game director Ben Brode and Sean "Day[9]" Plott as they reveal the last of the cards here on April 9 at 7pm BST / 8pm CEST. Related texts
