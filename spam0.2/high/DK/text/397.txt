Report: Fortnite overtakes PUBG in revenue Epic Games sees record-breaking performance in February. Text: David Caballero Published on the 23rd of Mar 2018 at 14 
It seems that, despite the push on Xbox One platforms for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Epic Games' Fortnite has kept its amazing momentum to surpass the former's revenue last month, making it one of the top-grossing games of the year so far, capitalising on its success in terms of streaming viewership. 
According to the analysis provided by SuperData , the passing of PUBG in terms of viewership was indeed directly proportional to success in the market. Based on the report, and comparing January and February's last weeks, Epic's game went from 6.1 million to 14.0 million viewers on Twitch, whereas Bluehole's PUBG went from 8.5 million to 8.7 million. At the same time, total revenue on all platforms peaked at 126 million US dollars for Fortnite, while it reached 103 million for PUBG. 
The study states that accessibility, availability, and the freemium model are the key pillars to Epic's success in the still new but soon-to-be-packed Battle Royale genre. Which is the better game though? Related texts
