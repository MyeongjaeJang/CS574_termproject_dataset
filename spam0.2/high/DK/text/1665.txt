Patong Bangla Road Nightlife â€“ Phuket 2016 â€“ VLOG 54 
A video of a night out at Bangla Road, Patong. This is the first of 2 parts and the footage from this video ends around 11pm. 
For most of this video I parked myself at the Crazy Horse Circus bar, this was mainly due to seeing the girl at the start jiggling around dancing on a fitness board. I couldnâ€™t resist taking a closer look ðŸ˜‰ 
Iâ€™ve chopped up the video a bit due to an overload of getting stuck in that bar with the Thai girls dancing. 
Some of the parts included in this vid are: 
0:02 Crazy Horse Circus bar, with show pole dancers 4:45 A walk along Patong Beach Road 7:11 Crazy Horse Circus bar, with girls on the fitness boards 10:48 Bangla Road sights 11:47 Bangla Road side alley and walk around 
Bangla Road is the centre of nightlife for the popular holiday destination of Phuket. 
Itâ€™s a great place for bar hopping, with many regular bars, beer bars, gogo bars, live music bars and nightclubs all on one street!
