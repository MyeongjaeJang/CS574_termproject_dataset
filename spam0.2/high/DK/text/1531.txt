The key to keeping your automobile fleet safe is technology and data collection, vehicle fleet management expert Joao Andrade told Global Fleet in an interview . This is especially important in countries like Brazil where only about 38% of its roads are in good condition. On average, approximately 44,000 people die every year from car accidents in the country. “To help assure safety, fleet managers must focus on using telematics to track the behavior of their drivers, providing on-line driver training programs, adequately maintaining their cars, and creating future action plans,” said Andrade who is the general manager for Brazilian vehicle leasing and car rental company Localiza. Currently, the company manages nearly 200,000 vehicles throughout South America for both daily car rentals and long-term leasing contracts. The vast majority of its vehicles are in Brazil.
