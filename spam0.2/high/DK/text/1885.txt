Pacific Breeze is a popular Angeles City hotel. The hotel is looking slightly dated, but it’s in an excellent location with a good gym and swimming pool. 
The rooms are very clean and despite being very close to the action they’re quiet at night. Room rates start from around $42 a night which is competitive for the area. 
Reserve your room as far in advance as possible as they often get fully booked here.
