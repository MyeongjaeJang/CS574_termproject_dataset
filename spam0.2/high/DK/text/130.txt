The art of forgiveness: afternoon workshop 
April Sat 7 | 13:30 – 16:45 | with Gen Daö 
It is impossible to go through our life without feeling harmed or insulted by others. If we develop a deep self-confidence and a compassionate mind towards others we will be able to remain at peace in these situations. We will then have the ability to let go of painful attitudes such as resentment and anger. 
On this afternoon workshop, Gen Kelsang Daö will explain practical methods for developing this strong, courageous mind, as well as the art of forgiving ourself. This will help us to enjoy more harmonious relationships, a kinder attitude towards ourself, and find peace. 
Workshop fee: 250kr | student 150kr | members 30kr
