Cyberpunk 2077 is obviously a major undertaking for CD Projekt Red, and coming off a major success with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, the studio has been gradually expanding for a long time. Now they're making a slightly bolder move by acquiring an entire studio to help work on the ambitious title. 
CD Projekt RED has revealed that they've acquired the Wroclaw-based studio Strange New Things and are renaming it to CD Projekt Wroclaw. The studio is comprised of 18 employees, and they mainly consist of ex-Techland developers, who helped make Dying Light. 
"Wrocław is one of the biggest and most technologically advanced cities in Poland and a playing field for serious creative talent. I think the scope of our current and future projects, as well as the overall package we're bringing in, will pull in people who were hesitant to move to Warsaw or Cracow," says Adam Kiciński, President and Joint CEO of CD PROJEKT Capital Group. "The founding dev team of CDPR Wrocław is already pretty stellar, but I still can't wait to see what talents we'll discover in new people along the way."
