The 'acrobatic ninja battle' game for up to eight players online coming our way from Soleil and Bandai Namco is getting a new open beta. This was revealed through a video from producer Niino Noriaki, where he thanks the fans for the feedback and says that a new round of beta testing will start in late July to early August. 
He also revealed some new gameplay details and told fans that they can look forward to playing two new characters: Sarada and Mitsuki. 
Sarada can heal her teammates while attacking enemies with Uchiha Shuriken Jutsu Spring Storm. Mitsuki's Sage Mode allows him to raise all of his abilities, but leaves him unable to use Ninjutsu at the same time. 
In addition, there will be a new master, namely Boruto, who will teach the players everything about Ninjutsu and other secret techniques, and a new stage, Hidden Leaf Village, which is easy to master and therefore suitable for beginners. Related texts
