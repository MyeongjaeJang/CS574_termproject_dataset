Just Dance 2018 adds Mario + Rabbids version of Beyoncé video It's a meta crossover jamboree! Text: Magnus Groth-Andersen Published on the 14th of Apr 2018 at 07 
Just like all major additions to the popular dance series, Just Dance 2018 gives you dance moves to mimic, and these cues are delivered alongside the original music video. Now though, you'll be able to pick up a very different version of the video attached to Beyoncé's Naughty Girl hit from 2003. 
Nintendo has released an alternate version of the video for the Nintendo Switch version of the game, starring Rabbid Peach from Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle . It is, as expected, quite hilarious, and below you can catch the full video in all its glory. Related texts
