Destiny 2's next expansion gets a name and a release date Warmind is coming next month. Text: Eirik Hyldbakk Furu & Markus Hirsil√§   16 
Despite having a fair few controversies since its launch, Destiny 2 is still going quite strong, and now Bungie has revealed official details about what to expect from the next expansion, although unfortunately there isn't that much to tell. 
The second expansion is called Warmind and will come with the next big update on May 8. More information will be made available on April 24, so for now we need to settle for knowing that "it will send you to new places to meet new heroes and battle new enemies". 
Bungie also states that they continue to listen community feedback, so "updates like Weapon Randomisation, Weapon Slot Changes, Gear Collections, and Records will be delivered to all players".
