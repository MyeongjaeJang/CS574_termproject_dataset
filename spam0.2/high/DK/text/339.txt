Easter means all kinds of traditions (depending on where you live, of course), and one of them we're seeing more and more of is discounts for video games. With that in mind, Playstation Blog has announced that the PS Store's Easter Sale has started. 
Discounted games include the likes of Assassin's Creed Origins (-40%), Nier: Automata (-50%), FIFA 18 (-57%) and Grand Theft Auto V (-57%), and naturally we're talking about digital sales here. These offers seem to be valid up until April 5th or April 12th, depending on the game. So make sure to check out all the different offers and let us know down below which ones you go for.
