What could EclairCity for Nintendo Switch be? Nintendo registered the name in late 2017. 1 comment 
It's Friday and you might as well let your imagination run free with the question: what could "EclairCity" possibly be? It's a title name registered by Nintendo of America for the company's console (the Switch), but what type of game could it be? 
Your guess is as good as ours, and we invite you to leave a comment below. The finding belongs to Pixelpar on Twitter , where they deduct a game based on this title or codename will be released at least via the eShop. 
Soon after, a follower responded on the same thread by saying: "Eclair is Kirby Star Allies project name. Maybe the full name is 'EclairCity' like how TorteCity was the project name of Kirby Planet Robobot?". Pixelpar adds that "EclairCity was certified the day after Kirby Star Allies has a separate rating", so perhaps this is all indeed related to the latest Kirby game in some way, or not at all. 
But what do you make of it (on a Friday)? 1 comment ActionJackson on the 24th of March 2018 at 00:25. Its a level in a Kirby game or some other equally uninteresting Nintendo Switch level in a equally uninteresting game or Nintendo could of bought the shops and the surrounding metropolis of Cadburys but I thought that was Birmingham to be honest, It could be a Labo set where you eat a packet of eclairs and instead of putting the wrappers in the bin (with youre Labo) you construct a city made of wrappers and Nintendo charge you Â£75.00 for the sweet wrappers and the bags Brilliant!!!!
