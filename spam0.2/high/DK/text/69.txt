Join us and get funky at Insomnia62 19/03/2018 
Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze for Nintendo Switch will be playable for the first time in the UK at Insomnia62 , the country’s biggest gaming festival, taking place 30th March to 2nd April at the NEC Birmingham. 
You’ll be able to give the game’s new Funky Mode a go too! It’s a chill new mode that allows you to play as Funky Kong, who’s able to double jump, hover, perform infinite rolls and even perform underwater corkscrews! Thanks to his sturdy surfboard, even spikes can't slow him down! Subscribe to on YouTube 
That’s not all though, other top Nintendo Switch titles will be playable, including Super Mario Odyssey , Mario Kart 8 Deluxe , Splatoon 2 , ARMS , Pokkén Tournament DX , EA SPORTS™ FIFA 18 , Rocket League® and Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition . 
We’ll also be hosting daily tournaments for Splatoon 2, ARMS, Pokkén Tournament DX and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe! To take part, simply sign up at the event on the day. It’s first come, first served so be sure to get to the Nintendo stand as early as possible. The finals will be played on the Nintendo stage with fun prizes up for grabs! 
Worried about missing   Championship? Fear not! We'll be showcasing the semi-finals and final at Insomnia62, as well as the Off the Hook virtual concert!
