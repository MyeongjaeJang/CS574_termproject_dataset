A monthly gathering serving up a feast for the mind and body. Sonic Feast is the second edition, showcasing the correlation between Taste and Sound with inspiring speakers and a multisensory sit down dinner specially composed to highlight the immersive power these two senses hold when brought together. 🍴 🎶 
The soundtrack to the event will be provided by Edwin Hind, well-known as part of Anglo-German duo Picnic at the Whitehouse, part of the emerging Berlin underground techno scene (1985 – 1990) and the lead singer/songwriter of Liverpool indie Synth pop outfit “Virgin Dance” who gained fame through an acclaimed John Peel Session on BBC Radio 1.
