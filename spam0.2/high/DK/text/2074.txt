Check out the announcement trailer for MapleStory 2 It's finally coming to regions outside of South Korea! Text: Suzanne Berget Published on the 17th of Apr 2018 at 14 
The long-awaited sequel to the adorable MapleStory (2005) is finally coming to regions outside of South Korea, where it has been available since 2015. 
As you can tell from the announcement trailer the sequel looks a little different from its 2D side-scrolling predecessor, opting instead for a blockish 3D world reminiscent of Minecraft . According to Nexon, the game takes place in the same world as the first game, the Maple World, and despite being a sequel, is more of a prequel. 
But even if we have an announcement trailer, we don't have a release date yet. What we do have, though, is the launch date for a closed beta, which you can sign up for now. The closed beta will start on May 9 and go on to May 16. For more information check out the trailer below: Related texts
