Big news regarding No Man's Sky this morning. First of all, it has been confirmed that the game is coming to Xbox One later this year and a retail edition of the game will be distributed by 505 Games. Secondly, and more importantly for existing players, Hello Games revealed that the next update, their biggest to date, called NEXT will arrive this summer (presumably the Xbox One version will drop around the same time). The reason for this announcement, which was made without actual details on what NEXT contains, was that it was about to leak. We reported yesterday on some rumblings . 
Here's what Sean Murray, Hello Games' founder, had to say on the matter via press release: 
"We are calling this No Man's Sky NEXT because it is an important next step in a journey for No Man's Sky , for Hello Games and for our devoted community." said Sean Murray, founder at Hello Games. "Each update for No Man's Sky has been more successful than the last; this was especially true of our last update Atlas Rises. It emboldens the team to push ourselves further. This journey is far from over, and it's exciting to be working again on something you know will surprise people."
