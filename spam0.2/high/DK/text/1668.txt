Sam Fisher has a nice little Easter Egg in Wildlands Warning - spoilers ahead. Text: Jonas MÃ¤ki   15 
We recently reported that Splinter Cell's Sam Fisher has landed in Ghost Recon: Wildlands , gracing us with a new mission, and we've recently found a rather funny Easter Egg that nods to another franchise (although be warned, if you want to see it for yourself you should look away now). 
In a bit of dialogue, which can be viewed over here , alongside some screenshots below, Fisher pays homage to another sneaky figure: Solid Snake. This if of course a nice little nod to the series, considering the future is in doubt after Hideo Kojima's departure from Konami. 
Could Sam Fisher beat Solid Snake in a fight though? Related texts
