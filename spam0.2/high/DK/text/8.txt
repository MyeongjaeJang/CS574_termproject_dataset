Subway Surfers , the graffiti-themed runner by Kiloo and Sybo Games, has been downloaded an astonishing one billion times on Google Play. With 400 million downloads last year alone (they don't specify, so we're assuming that's counting iOS downloads too) the free-to-play game continues to grow in popularity.
