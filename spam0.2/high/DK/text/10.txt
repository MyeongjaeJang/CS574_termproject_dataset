Ubisoft has given the PR drum for Far Cry 5 one last hit, this time via a new live-action trailer for the game that landed this week, giving us even more incentive to dive into Hope County, Montana, and tackle the cultish threat that's growing bolder with every unpunished crime committed. 
We went to Paris a couple of weeks ago to take one last look at the game ahead of its coming release on PC, PS4, and Xbox One on March 27, and we'll find out in the coming days whether or not it lives up to our lofty expectations. Check out the trailer below. Related texts
