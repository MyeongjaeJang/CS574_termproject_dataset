Gamereactor was on site in PAX East 2018 in Boston, and among the many games we saw and interviews we conducted, we also saw some cosplayers, a bunch of which did a little dance battle for all to see. 
You can watch the full video down below, featuring a lot of Spider-Mans (Spider-Men?) and even the cuddly Pikachu. Which costume is your favourite? Related texts
