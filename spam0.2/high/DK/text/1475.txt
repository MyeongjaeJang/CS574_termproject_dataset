Everybody has been trying to go green and healthy for over a decade. So it is no surprise that salad bars a popping up across the metro. We dropped by Craft Salad at the SM Aura Food on Four in BGC before watching Ready Player One at the IMAX. Craft Salad was opened in 2015 and offers a variety of salad specialties, hearty soups, rice bowls, and sandwiches. Craft Salad also lets you build your own salad from a range of fresh ingredients. We recommend the Vegan Salad with Quinoa.
