A new Castlevania game is coming... ... but only for iOS devices and only in Japan. Text: Suzanne Berget Published on the 17th of Apr 2018 at 12 
All Castlevania fans rejoice, a new game is coming! Oh wait, maybe don't rejoice fully just yet, as it looks like the game is currently only destined for iOS devices. In Japan. And has no release date. But there's a closed beta test, which you can sign up for here , if you have a iOS device (and can read Japanese). 
The announcement comes from Konami's official website (translated by the fine folks over at Gematsu ). According to the website the game takes place in a future where Dracula has been completely destroyed and peace reigns. But someone is intent on disturbing that peace, sending the main character, Genya Arikado, on a long and dangerous journey, fraught with enemies and mysteries. 
The game features exciting fights for up to four players, real-time global co-op, 4v4 competitive mode, beautiful graphics and music from previous Castlevania-games. 
Considering the game features real-time global co-op it would be safe to assume the game will be making it's way to other regions at some point. Is this a game you'd be interested in playing? You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now ! Ã—
