You & Liljas Library: Photo Contest   15:22:29 
As you know (and if you didnt you do now) I have been running a contest to celebrate Liljas Librarys 20-year anniversary. The winner will get a copy of the US   signed by me and Vincent Chong (I can add a personal note as well if youd like me to). The ending of the contest has been delayed a few times due to the fact that the book itself has been delayed but now I have set a date for when I will draw a winner and that is Sunday April 15. To enter I want you to send in a photo of yourself and Liljas Library. Liljas Library you might ask? Yes, take a photo of yourself and Liljas Library in some form. It could be you in front of the computer (where you can see Liljas Library), it could be a photo of you and my book, it could be a photo of you and your tattoo of Marv (if anyone has one), or any other form of Liljas Library. Draw Marv and pose with him, read the site on your phone and take a photo of yourself doing it your imagination is the limit. The rule is that Liljas Library and you need to be in the photo (and not just a toe or a finger, your face at least). Thats it. Not to hard, right? I will then draw the photo I like the best (what I like is for me to know and you to find out) as the winner. If you have already sent a photo and think: "darn I should have been more creative", then just send another one. As mentioned the prize is a copy of Shining in the Dark: Celebrating Twenty Years of Liljas Library . So start sending in your photos, either by email to info[a]liljas-library.com or post them on facebook , twitter or Instagram . I will then pull them from there and post them on the site. Check out your competition here . I hope to SEE you soon! / Lilja
