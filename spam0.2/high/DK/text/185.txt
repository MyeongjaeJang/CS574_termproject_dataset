GR Live today features Assassin's Creed Rogue Remastered We'll be playing the enhanced version for two hours. Text: Sam Bishop Published on the 21st of Mar 2018 at 12 
Assassin's Creed Rogue isn't exactly one of the most famous entries in the franchise, and that's perhaps why we've just received Assassin's Creed Rogue Remastered on PS4 and Xbox One, to bring Shay Patrick Cormac's adventure back into the public eye and give it a new lease of life. 
What better time for us to revisit this adventure than on today's livestream, then, and you can join us from 15:00 GMT (16:00 CET) on our live page for a few hours to see how this stands up to the original, or just experience the whole thing for the first time.
