Top / H&M Collar / KENZO 
Akira Honda’s photography takes us to a colour collage in this Schön! online editorial. Fashion by Ami Sasahara sees model Yuko Tamai in bold colours and playful silhouettes from brands such as JUNYA WATANABE and Comme des Garçons. Kato uses a straight bob cut and baby pink lip to create a final sense of fun for this shoot. Sweater / H&M
