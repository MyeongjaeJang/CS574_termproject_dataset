Making knitted hats since she was 15, Belgian Ellen Kegels took the knitting wear game to a whole new level and launched her own knitwear label LN|KNITS seven years ago. Expanding her collection and championing a type of fashion that shuns mass production, Kegels instead opts to have an honest and fair brand, with the soft wool of Peruvian baby alpacas as a base fabric. Her collection is for those looking for comfort, style, and uniqueness, all packed neatly together. Making knitted hats well through her college years, at one point Kegels would make six hats a day.
