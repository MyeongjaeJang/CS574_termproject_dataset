W e can all save a few drops of water each day. Simply turning the faucet off when we brush our teeth will save 6 litres every minute. We can also repair dripping faucets, which can waste 15 litres of water every day. That’s about 5,500 litres a year! af GROHE   
Water is the essential element that makes our bathroom rituals so special. So personal. So enjoyable.That’s why GROHE is proud to help everyone experience the pure joy of water. 
But drinkable wateris also becoming increasingly rare. That’s why GROHE has a burning passion to save every drop we can. It’s a passion that has already, throughout several decades, created numerous sustainable solutions. And each solution has intensified our passion, spurring us on to the next level of finding water and energy saving technologies. It is no surprise, then, that GROHE considers sustainability to be one of its core brand values, alongside technology, quality and design. Filer
