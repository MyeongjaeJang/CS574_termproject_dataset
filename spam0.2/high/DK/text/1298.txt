A VLOG from June 2016 taken at Nana Plaza and the surrounding street Soi 4 late after midnight. This video is the second part from the night after VLOG 77. 
This video features the so called Nana Plaza â€šLadyboy walk of deathâ€˜ and also some ladyboy trouble in front of the Soi 4 Nana McDonaldâ€™s. 
The parts of this video are: 
0:00 Nana Plaza 8:08 Ladyboy Walk of Deat.h 10:00 Soi 4 Nana late at night 11:19 Ladyboy freelancer trouble 13:13 Taxi rejecting passengers 
Nana Plaza 
On this night it was quite late but the bars were still doing an ok trade with a mixture of regular customers and tourists around. 
The Ladyboy Walk of D.eath 
This corner on the 1st floor of Nana Plaza can be hard to get through the ladyboys. They try to coax you into their bars especially later at night. 
If you are intoxicated then can be very hard to get through as our 2 friends found out in this video ðŸ™‚ 
Ladyboy trouble in front of McDonaldâ€™s 
I thought it was going to kick off for a minute with a couple of freelancer ladyboys. You have to remember that some are just like men in that they love a good late night scrap before heading home! 
Taxis 
If you ever had a problem in lower Sukhumvit getting a taxi, you are not alone in that the locals have similar problems too. 
No need to react about it, just get one of the many following taxis and one will take you for a metered rate. 
The pole dancer outro to this video was shot at the â€šcrazy horse circus barâ€˜ on Bangla Road in Patong, Thailand.
