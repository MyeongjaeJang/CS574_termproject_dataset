170 g white chocolate chips 
2 tbsp mini fudge chunks 
2 tbsp peanut butter 
30 g peanuts, chopped roughly 
Method: 
Pre-heat your oven to 175 C 
Beat butter, muscovadosugar, cane sugar and seeds from the vanilla pod till you have a light and airy mixture. 
Add the egg and beat until it is well incorporated. Pour in the peanut butter. 
Add the flour and salt and beat till the dough is just mixed together. Donâ€™t over beat the dough. 
Fold in the chocolate chips, fudge chunks and roughly chopped peanuts. 
Pour the dough into a baking pan lined with baking paper. The pan I used is about 15cm x 15cm. 
Bake the blondie for 30-40 minutes, or until the blondie is golden. 
Leave the blondie to cool on a rack. 
Store in the fridge.
