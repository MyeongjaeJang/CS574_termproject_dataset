The Alliance Alive available in western countries Almost a year after its release in Japan. Text: Islem Sharouda Published on the 1st of Apr 2018 at 15 
The Alliance Alive was released in June 2017 in Japan, and has now come to the west for the very first time. The Americans will be entitled to physical versions, whilst we in Europe will have to make do with a digital version. 
A demo for the game has been available on the eShop of the 3DS since last February, and two editions have appeared this week. First there's a classic edition, but the collector's edition contains an artbook, the OST of the game, and a keychain, all of which was unveiled in the launch video released by Atlus.
