Play PUBG for free next week on Xbox One With all the modes included. Text: Jonas MÃ¤ki   13 
Starting next Thursday (April 19), PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds will be available as a free trial on Xbox One, as announced on Xbox Wire , which means everyone with Xbox Live Gold can participate and enjoy it until Sunday (April 22). 
Everything you unlock and all your Battle Points will be kept if you decide to buy the game at a later point, and it's also worth noting that this is the full game with no exceptions, so all modes will be there for you to try out. If you've been debating whether the Xbox version is any good, then, there's no reason not to try it now, right? Related texts
