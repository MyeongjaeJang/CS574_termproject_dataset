Do you remember Lumines? The rhythm-based music puzzler from Tetsuya Mizuguchi's Q Entertainment that was one of the great early titles for Sony's PSP? It's gotten a few sequels and spin-offs over the years, but now Mizuguchi returns to it with his new outfit Enhance Games, to bring us Lumines Remastered. The classic puzzle game is set to land on PC, PS4, Switch and Xbox One this May. 
There will be over 40 skins to play, and the game will make use of the HD Rumble in the Joy-Cons, something that will make you feel the music and beats better presumably. The PC, PS4, and Xbox One versions offer 4K resolution and there will be online leaderboards to allow players to test their skills. Related texts
