The dynamic team around A01 founders Maria Planegger and Andreas Schmitzer uses a unique and sometimes experimental design language to create high-end extraordinary architecture, which not only stands out visually but also ticks all the required boxes in terms of functionality. A building is not just a building. It is a way to express personality, to identify and create a sense of belonging, or to serve a specific purpose to perfection. There are many so reasons why architecture has always played a major role in our society and for the two founders of A01 architects, Maria Planegger and Andreas Schmitzer, it is therefore absolute key to creatively merge individuality with function.
