Tendering The key to attracting more electric, hybrid, and natural gas operated vehicles in Bogota is creating public policies that promote clean mobility. This is according to motor vehicles association Ademos president Oliverio Garcia who was responding to a claim by mayor Enrique Peñalosa, local broadcaster RCN radio said. According to the mayor, there is a lack of companies offering these types of vehicles for the city’s TransMilenio bus system. Garcia desagrees, however. “When tendering for the buses, real incentives must be put into place to encourage the use of electric, hybrid, and natural gas vehicles," he says.
