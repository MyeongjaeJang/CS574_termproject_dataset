GDC 2018 breaks attendance record Developer focused week in San Francisco attracts more than 28,000 attendees.   31st of Mar 2018 at 14 
The Game Developers Conference in San Francisco drew a record 28,000 attendees this as the week-long activities concluded last Friday. Over 750 sessions and 550 exhibitors make up what's over the years grown to become a major fixture on the gaming calendar every year. 
GDC also encompasses VRDC and numerous indie spotlights, as well as The Game Developers Choice Awards and Independent Games Festival (IGF). 
"True to its name, the Game Developers Conference is an event for everyone in the games industry, from the aspiring game makers in the indie showcases, to the legendary creators in the classic games postmortems, and everyone in-between. It also helps spotlight the best games of the year, the most promising indie teams, the most advanced technology, and the most pressing social issues as reflected by the industry as a whole," said Katie Stern, general manager of the Game Developers Conference via press release. "Games can be a vehicle for art, but they're also the product of the hard work of game creators from around the world, and GDC will continue to work to showcase the best talent and to help support those on the verge of creating something special that pushes the medium forward. We hope that GDC 2018 has given that developer the push they needed." 
Next year's GDC has been set for March 18-22 and will once more take place at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Photo courtesy of GDC. You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now ! Ã—
