Jake Gyllenhaal is not going to be Batman The Batfleck baton has not been passed just yet. 1 comment 
Benn Affleck has now filles the shoes of the Batman for a few films, but there are rumours of a new Caped Crusader coming our way. Rumour has it that it could be Jake Gyllenhaal replacing the Batfleck, a guy best known for his roles in movies like Prince of Persia and Brokeback Mountain, but during an interview with CNA Lifestyle he denied that. 
Specifically, Gyllenhaal was asked if he is going to be the next Batman, but the answer was definitive: "Wow, that's a very difficult question. The answer to that question is 'no'." Who should it be instead? 1 comment ActionJackson on the 15th of April 2018 at 15:19. Jake is way way to cool to be Batman (im a massive Batman fan) i just dont know who I can see being the next Batman, Affleck is going through another one of his 'im actually a total douchebag folks' phases he gets to big for his boots then he realises it and is cool again, I dont dislike Afflecks Batman I mean we haven't seen him in his own movie yet have we??? Get Affleck, WB, DC and Zack Snyder together WB to absolutely kiss ass to Snyder and say 'look Zack as you can tell we haven't got a clue what were doing now we really apologise for getting Josh in to sabotage JL now er dod you think you could come back and do what Superman does and save the world???/ When will WB and the rest of the world understand the DCUs superheroes are damaged, dark and battered not brightly coloured mass marketed Walt Disney which have to have every member of every franchise in practically every minute of there films, DC in the movie world has truly lost its way and WB (warner bros) are the only ones to blame Zack Snyder had an almost perfect vision for DC and now we more thank likely will never see this come to fruition
