The next Halo game aiming for 4K and 60FPS Job listing points to Halo 6 development. Text: Suzanne Berget Published on the 17th of Apr 2018 at 09 
It has been relatively quiet on the Halo front for a while now, and that means that long-time fans are getting a little antsy as we wait for more news on the future of Master Chief. 
Is there another Halo game in the works? The answer is: yes! Although Halo 6 hasn't been officially revealed, it's clear that 343 Industries are, in fact, working on it. 
That is, of course, if this job listing (which went up a few days ago) is anything to go by. In the listing 343 Industries says that it is looking for a lead graphics developer who will work on future Halo titles and push the visual bar to inconceivable levels: 
"As the Graphics Lead, you will be leading, managing, and contributing directly on the award-winning graphics team, collaborating closely with the art teams and pushing the visual bar to inconceivable levels on future FPS Halo titles. The ideal candidate will have a passion for game graphics and for directing a team, love getting their hands dirty working directly with the content teams while coding incredible systems. You will drive graphical innovation and produce amazing systems and visuals for our entire future FPS Halo experiences. If stunning 60 Hz 4k graphics gets you excited, this is the right job for you."
