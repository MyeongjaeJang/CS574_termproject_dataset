The licenses are a recognition of a long and good development process in which NRS, Aker ASA and Aker Solutions have developed a semi-submersible offshore fish farm designed for harsh areas 
The facility will provide significantly increased area utilisation of Norwegian sea waters when positioned farther away from the coast, where in addition it will have a small environmental footprint. www.norwayroyalsalmon.com 
An extensive effort has been put in place to develop this concept. At the same time, there has been an open, positive and constructive dialogue with the Directorate of Fisheries to adjust the concept within a framework that were acceptable to the parties. 
The original concept should have been established in the open sea and required four units and 15 licenses. In the revised concept it is proposed to use a site at the mouth of a fjord with two units and 7.68 associated development licenses. 
Because the project has been scaled down to about half of the original project size and the capital requirements have been significantly reduced, Aker has chosen not to move further into the pilot and realisation phase. Aker Solutions will continue as a technology and collaboration partner in the project. 
The facility will be significantly more exposed than todayâ€™s locations. Meanwhile, other environmental conditions on such sites are very attractive for salmon, with good water exchange that will ensure good fish welfare, growth and environmental sustainability. 
NRS is working towards a goal of putting the first fish in the sea during the summer of 2020. The industrial ambition is to combine knowledge from the fish farming industry with offshore expertise to develop the aquaculture industry of the future and secure sustainable future growth for the Norwegian aquaculture industry.
