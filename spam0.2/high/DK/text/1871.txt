GoG will be getting Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire and Battletech in their digital store, both DRM-free and with exclusive offers, as if you pre-order or buy Pillars of Eternity 2 using GoG until May 15 (it's releasing on the platform at May 8), you will also get Wasteland 2 Director's Cut Digital Classic Edition for free. As for Battletech, if you pre-order or buy the game until May 8 (it's coming on April 24), you'll also be getting Shadowrun for free. 
That's not only two stellar games in their own right, but also some free games, and who can say no to free games, right? You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now ! Ã—
