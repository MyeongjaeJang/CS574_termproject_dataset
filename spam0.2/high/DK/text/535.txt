Pokémon Go adds research and Mew New Field Research mechanic will lead players to discover Mew. Text: Bengt Lemne   
The folks at Niantic Labs continue to evolve and expand Pokémon Go in spite of the initial hype having subsided. The latest new addition is a mechanic called Field Research, where the players will aid Professor Willow in his research and potentially discover Mew, the Mythical Psychic-Type Pokémon. Interestingly, this research will also allow players to learn more about Mew in the process, so it's not júst a case of having to jump through hoops in order to gain a chance of catching Mew. 
This new mechanic will be introduced later this week. Related texts
