Hitman's Sapienza episode free as part of Spring Update And it's free to keep if you download it in the next couple of weeks.   17 
Hitman was released two years ago as an episodic game, where consumers could choose to buy the entire package or each episode individually as they were gradually released. The very first episode has been free for a while, and now the second one has followed suit. 
The Hitman Spring Pack is available on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One for free, and it contains the game's second (and probably best) location, Sapienza, the World of Tomorrow mission, challenges, location mastery assignments, escalation contracts, elusive targets, and much more. 
The content is free until April 3, and if you grab it before then it's free to keep. Plus, if you already own the first episode, all your experience will automatically carry over. Is this the best news you've heard all day? Related texts
