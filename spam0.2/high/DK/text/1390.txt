I år vil der i ugen før selve hovedmessen, som afholdes den 2 – 3. november, blive afviklet en “BlizzCon Opening Week”, hvor de fleste af finaledeltagerne i de forskellige spil skal findes. Det er StarCraft II World Championship Series, Heroes of the Storm® Global Championship Finals samt World of Warcraft® Arena World Championship Finals, der skal kæmpes i / om i ugen før selve BLizzCons to hoveddage. 
Er du interesseret i være med i år, skal du være hurtig når billetsalget åbner. Det sker på to dage: Den 10 og 12 maj (dansk tid). Billeterne til showet bliver normalt udsolgt på et par timer, så det er om at være hurtig. 
Blizzard har endnu ikke fortalt hvilket stort band de i år vil få til at lukke og slukke showet. Blizzard har for vane at byde på en overraskelse eller to mht. spilannonceringer. I kunne det være oplagt med enten et nyt Warcraft eller måske mere nyt i Diablo-regi. 
PARIS, France — April 9, 2018 — Team up with your friends and family and get ready for a journey to Southern California for BlizzCon® 2018, Blizzard Entertainment’s epic celebration of games and esports and the communities that bring them to life. Tickets to the main event, taking place at the Anaheim Convention Center on November 2 and 3, will go on sale on two dates: Thursday, May 10 and Saturday, May 12.
