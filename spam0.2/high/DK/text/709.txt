DALLAS legend Patrick Duffy looked dramatically different from his Bobby Ewing days as he showed off his slick silver mane during a TV appearance. The 69-year-old was known for his floppy black mane while starring in the iconic CBS drama. However, he looked a tad different when he appeared on a German entertainment show called Welcome To Carmen Nebel with David Hasselhoff on Saturday night. He also performed with French singer Mireille Mathieu, who he had a hit song with in 1983 called Together We’re Strong. Patrick is known for playing the youngest son of Miss Ellie and the nicest brother of J.R. Ewing in Dallas from 1978 to 1985 and from 1986 to 1991. He later reprised his role when the soap was rebooted on TNT from 2012 to 2014. Patrick recently said he always knew he wanted to be an actor. He said: “From high school on I wanted to act, that was all I wanted to do. I wasn’t employed for years but I have been very fortunate and successful.” Patrick was married to wife Carlyn for 41 years before her death last year and the couple have two sons and four grandchildren.
