Klei Entertainment has confirmed that its survival game Don't Starve is heading to the Switch next week. The Nintendo Switch Edition is set to hit the eShop on April 12, complete with the Shipwrecked and Reign of Giants expansions. It'll cost around $20 or regional equivalent. As is the way with these things, the announcement came alongside a trailer, which you can watch below. 
Don't Starve isn't the only game by Klei heading to Nintendo Switch. Just last month the studio revealed Mark of the Ninja Remastered, which is heading to the platform before the end of 2018. Related texts
