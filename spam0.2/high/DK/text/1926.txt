Critical Role to voice Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire cast A little treat for fans of tabletop RPGs. Text: Markus Hirsil√§ Published on the 15th of Apr 2018 at 08 
Obsidian Entertainment has announced a partnership between Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire's publisher Versus Evil and Critical Role (who, if you don't know, are described as the "the biggest group in live-stream tabletop role-playing"). 
In the upcoming Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire, players can choose the voices from Critical Role's cast from their first Dungeons & Dragons campaign, Vox Machina, as character voices for their created party members in the game. Also, special "Vox Machina player portraits will be available as a free DLC when Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire launches on May 8th". 
"I was such a fan of the original Pillars game, and thoroughly enjoying being a part of the vibrant world the team created," says voice actor and Critical Role DM, Matthew Mercer. "With the wonderful folks of Obsidian now bringing the entire cast of Critical Role to bring even more of the world of Eora to life, it's sparked this incredible opportunity to bring our Critical Role characters of Vox Machina into their world via custom art and voice sets. A truly surreal milestone for this D&D nerd." 
Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire is releasing on May 8 on PC, PS4, Nintendo Switch, and on Xbox One. Related texts
