ID@Xbox has generated more than one billion dollars A figure that even Doctor Evil can get behind! Text: Jonas Mäki Published on the 20th of Mar 2018 at 19 
Microsoft's popular program for self-publishing indie games on Xbox One, ID@Xbox, has reached a very impressive milestone that clearly shows why Microsoft continues to support the concept. Since it launched back in 2013, the platform has now generated revenue that totals more than one billion dollars (US). 
So far, 477 studios have released over 800 games, and that is about to grow with over 50 games that are being shown at GDC. 17 of those are newly announced games for the Xbox One. These are impressive numbers for Microsoft and we probably shouldn't expect ID@Xbox to disappear anytime soon with results like these. You must be logged in to comment.
