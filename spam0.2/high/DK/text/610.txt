Paradox Interactive and Harebrained Schemes (Shadowrun Returns), have announced that BattleTech, the turn-based tactical mech game, is heading to PC and Mac on April 24. 
The game lets you play as the commander of a mercenary company who must manage a number of Mechwarriors and their various operations as they try to aid a deposed ruler out on the edge of civilised space. 
"The entire team at Harebrained Schemes has been eagerly awaiting the day we deliver BattleTech to long time fans and introduce the joy of tactical 'Mech combat and deadly interstellar politics to new ones," said Jordan Weisman, CEO of Harebrained Schemes and creator of the MechWarrior and BattleTech universe. "We're massively thankful to our Kickstarter backers and fans of the MechWarrior legacy. Without their patience, dedication and support, this modern turn-based BattleTech wouldn't soon be launching on PC and Mac."
