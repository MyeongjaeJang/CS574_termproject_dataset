Steins;Gate came out all the way back in 2009, but during last week's GDC (Game Developers Conference) publisher Spike Chunsoft announced Steins;Gate Elite for PC (Steam), PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch, a remaster of the original game containing anime sequences from the adaptation of this title. 
If you plan to play Steins;Gate: Elite on the Nintendo Switch you'll get a special 8-bit version of the game with matching illustrations and chiptune sound, whereas PS4 owners receive a HD remake of Steins;Gate Linear Bounded Phenogram, which is a collection of ten additional stories written by Zero Escape author Kotaru Uchikoshi among other writers. 
Steins;Gate: Elite will launch physically and digitally this year, and more info can be found on the Steam shop . If that's not enough though, check out the trailer and screenshots down below. 
Will you be replaying Steins;Gate as part of this remaster, or experiencing it for the first time? Related texts
