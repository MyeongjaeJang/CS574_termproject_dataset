Nicolas Cage thinks he'd make a great Joker Or perhaps even Doctor Doom. Text: Petter Hegevall Published on the 15th of Apr 2018 at 11 
The beloved Nicolas Cage - who played Ghost Rider - has become a bit of a meme on the internet in recent years, but it seems as if he has plans to rejoin the world of comic books heroes and villains, as in a recent interview with JoBlo he talked about perhaps playing Batman's arch-nemesis, among others. 
"I mean, I think my comic book days are kind of... I'm on to other things, but I always thought I'd make a great Joker and I always thought that I would've been a good villain in one of the Marvel movies like Doctor Doom," he said. "But, Doctor Doom you have to wear that mask, but I thought the story leading up to Doctor Doom could've been interesting. At this point if I was to go back into the format it would probably have to be as a villain." 
Could Cage be a good Joker? You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now ! Ã—
