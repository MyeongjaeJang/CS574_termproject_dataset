Thanks to Kanada-Ya for treating us to their new branch in Upper Street, north London. It was time to get slurping on their delicious Tonkotsu ramen bowls. 🍜 😛 
The restaurant is located along trendy Upper Street surrounded by bars, pubs and other places to eat. 
We tasted one of their homemade noodles cooked specifically to our taste! (You can choose from soft to hard!) The sides included tuffle edamame, karaage chicken, rice balls and of course a Japanese beer and hot sake to drink! 
A ramen bar is a great addition to the area and the casual vibe makes it an ideal spot for lunch or dinner. We can’t wait to go back and try more ramen! Look out for the secret sauce made by Mr Kanada himself! A post shared by Kanada-Ya London (@kanada_ya_ldn) on Apr 5, 2018 at 8:45am PDT
