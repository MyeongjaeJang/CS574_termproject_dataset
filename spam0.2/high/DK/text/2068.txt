Previous Next The Political and Economic Crisis in Iran, and its Social Dimensions 
This sec­tion intends to bring read­ers to an under­stand­ing of the cur­rent polit­i­cal and social real­i­ty sur­round­ing Iran­ian his­to­ry, pol­i­tics and iden­ti­ty while also focus­ing on the Iran­ian inter­nal state of affairs and the rela­tions with its neigh­bors. 
The eco­nom­ic struc­ture of Iran is an impor­tant denom­i­na­tor for its behav­ior as a state. Eco­nom­i­cal­ly, Iran is one of the rich­est coun­tries in the Mid­dle East and South Asian region. One of the most impor­tant fea­tures of Iran’s polit­i­cal econ­o­my is the p rima­cy of pol­i­tics over econ­o­my . [1] In oth­er words, Iran’s econ­o­my after the ’79 rev­o­lu­tion has always depend­ed on the polit­i­cal atmos­phere and polit­i­cal cul­ture that over­rule the soci­ety under the doc­trine of self-suf­fi­cien­cy and self-reliance. 
As a num­ber of stud­ies have argued, one of the main obser­va­tions in indus­tri­al­ized economies is the impor­tance of the mid­dle class for devel­op­ment. [2] Accord­ing to these stud­ies, the his­tor­i­cal role for the mid­dle class in the social and polit­i­cal tran­si­tion as a motor for ear­ly indus­tri­al­iza­tion in devel­op­ing coun­tries, leads to the argu­ment that in the case of Iran, a capa­ble mid­dle class should have been trig­ger­ing reform and a demo­c­ra­t­ic future after the ’79 rev­o­lu­tion. The Iran­ian mid­dle class has failed until today to do so. A more inclu­sive polit­i­cal sys­tem requires a mid­dle class of peo­ple whose eco­nom­ic posi­tion is inde­pen­dent of those in pow­er. [3] This arti­cle will shine a light on the role of the state in the econ­o­my and what this means for the posi­tion of the mid­dle class. 
Iran as a Ren­tier State 
After the ’79 rev­o­lu­tion, the rev­o­lu­tion­ar­ies’ inher­it­ed an econ­o­my that in less than a cen­tu­ry trans­formed from an agri­cul­ture-based sys­tem, which was led by a trib­al dynasty, to a mod­ern oil pro­duc­ing enti­ty. Coun­tries with wealth derived from fos­sil fuels and cer­tain min­er­als often fail to grow at the same pace as coun­tries which lack nat­ur­al resources. This phe­nom­e­non, known as the Nat­ur­al Resource Curse [4] is used to describe how coun­tries rich in min­er­al resources were unable to use that wealth to boost their economies and how, counter-intu­itive­ly, these coun­tries tend to have less eco­nom­ic growth, less democ­ra­cy, and worse devel­op­ment out­comes than coun­tries with few­er nat­ur­al resources. In addi­tion, the ren­tier state the­o­ry which claims that any state that derives sub­stan­tial part of its rev­enue from for­eign sources and under the form of rent reflects the Iran­ian econ­o­my, which is high­ly depen­dent on oil dom­i­na­tion as for Iran, oil and gas rev­enues are the main source of for­eign exchange earn­ings and fis­cal rev­enues. [5] [6] 
As oil ren­tier states such as Iran can rely on sub­stan­tial income of, exter­nal rents , there is a less­er need to tax the pop­u­la­tion. One of the social back­lash­es of this phe­nom­e­non is that the lead­er­ship is hard­ly account­able to their pop­u­la­tion as the flow of resource rents allows the state a cer­tain degree of auton­o­my vis-a-vis its pop­u­la­tion, there­by indif­fer­ent against social and polit­i­cal pres­sures, accord­ing to the prin­ci­pal “ No tax­a­tion, no rep­re­sen­ta­tion ”. [8] [9] In resource poor or less resource abun­dant soci­eties, free mar­ket prin­ci­ples leads to the over­all cre­ation of eco­nom­ic, gov­er­nance and judi­cia­ry insti­tu­tions. This in turn pro­vides more rep­re­sen­ta­tion to the pop­u­la­tion in the run­ning of the affairs of the econ­o­my and state. The incen­tive how­ev­er for the gov­ern­ments of ren­tier states to open up their econ­o­my to the free mar­ket prin­ci­ples is rather unlike­ly. In addi­tion to that, the idea of an increas­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tive pop­u­la­tion chal­leng­ing the prin­ci­ples of author­i­tar­i­an­ism and the inher­ent­ly decrease of the cen­tral authority’s pow­er, is in many cas­es sim­ply not an option. The con­di­tions and pre­vail­ing inter­ests tend to lead to the imple­men­ta­tion of mil­i­tary rule and author­i­tar­i­an solu­tions to con­flicts. [10] 
The Islam­ic Repub­lic of Iran: A Hybrid Polit­i­cal Sys­tem 
Although there are numer­ous indi­ca­tions that point to author­i­tar­i­an­ism, the Iran­ian case is more com­plex than that. It is argued that the Iran­ian Con­sti­tu­tion is a curi­ous hybrid of theo­crat­ic, author­i­tar­i­an and demo­c­ra­t­ic ele­ments. [11] It is a con­sti­tu­tion­al, theo­crat­ic repub­lic in which Shi’a Mus­lim cler­gy and polit­i­cal lead­ers vet­ted by the cler­gy dom­i­nate the key pow­er struc­tures, the supreme leader. Polit­i­cal schol­ars have cat­e­go­rized the Islam­ic Repub­lic of Iran as an “elec­toral-author­i­tar­i­an” regime of a new sort. [12] The polit­i­cal sys­tem is com­posed of a com­plex net­work of elect­ed and non-elect­ed insti­tu­tions that con­trol each oth­er along the deci­sion-mak­ing process. The gov­ern­ment has a leg­is­la­ture and a pres­i­dent, both select­ed by Iran­ian vot­ers, but it also has a supreme leader, whose title makes clear that he has more pow­er than the pres­i­dent and is not demo­c­ra­t­i­cal­ly elect­ed. His pow­er affects the whole polit­i­cal sys­tem. So it can be argued that Iran fits the pic­ture only part­ly of how resources became a curse for the over­all devel­op­ment. Although the regime invest­ed the rev­enue from oil heav­i­ly in arms and weapons to strength­en the regime’s- inter­nal as well as transna­tion­al- pow­er base instead of fund­ing the man­i­fes­ta­tions of domes­tic devel­op­ment such as job cre­ation and edu­ca­tion, it became at the same time more effec­tive in keep­ing the oppo­si­tion at bay and more influ­en­tial in world pol­i­tics and less sus­cep­ti­ble to inter­na­tion­al pres­sure by estab­lish­ing demo­c­ra­t­ic insti­tu­tions. Log­i­cal­ly, this is the sphere where the mid­dle class comes in the pic­ture as they can hold parts of the polit­i­cal struc­ture account­able. [13] 
Mid­dle class in Iran 

In recent his­to­ry we can rough­ly divide the tra­di­tion­al pre-rev­o­lu­tion­ary mid­dle class under the Pahlavi monar­chy, com­posed of pet­ty bour­geoisie made up of small farm­ers, small pro­duc­ers, and a sig­nif­i­cant­ly dif­fer­ent make up of the mod­ern, post-rev­o­lu­tion mid­dle class. Although the Islam­ic Rev­o­lu­tion of ’79 was a broad­ly car­ried pop­u­lar revolt of dif­fer­ent polit­i­cal and social groups demand­ing the res­ig­na­tion of the Shah, the Shi’a reli­gious estab­lish­ment direct­ly after­wards took con­trol of the rev­o­lu­tion and crushed its for­mer oppo­si­tion allies while intro­duc­ing deep changes with­in Iran­ian soci­ety. The Islam­ic gov­ern­ment from the begin­ning start­ed to sup­port the low­er class­es play­ing on the idea, sup­port­ed by both reli­gious and sec­u­lar lead­ers of the Islam­ic Rev­o­lu­tion- that the deposed Pahlavi monar­chy delib­er­ate­ly had neglect­ed agri­cul­ture and rur­al eco­nom­ic devel­op­ment in its efforts to cre­ate in Iran an imi­ta­tion of a Euro­pean urban, indus­tri­al­ized soci­ety. As a result a new Iran­ian mid­dle class was shaped which was polit­i­cal­ly expe­di­ent as well as ide­o­log­i­cal. The Iran- Iraq war (1980–1988) and a new socio-eco­nom­ic real­i­ty led to rur­al exo­dus towards the cities and cre­at­ed an oppor­tu­ni­ty for the gov­ern­ment to enforce its social jus­tice prin­ci­ples by recon­struct­ing a theo­crat­ic Shi­ite Per­sian-cen­tric nation [14] , tying the new­ly emerg­ing social group to the gov­ern­ment by sub­si­dies and price reduc­tions. [15] At the same time, Iran wit­nessed the emer­gence of anoth­er polit­i­cal pil­lar in the mer­chant class, who were a pow­er­ful ally in the ear­li­er years of the Islam­ic repub­lic because they account­ed for some of the most influ­en­tial and wealthy com­po­nents of soci­ety. The influ­ence of the mer­chant class has over­time trans­formed in a grow­ing edu­cat­ed work­ing class ‘ elite’ , which is much more vocal of its polit­i­cal and eco­nom­ic griev­ances. [16] 
Dis­ap­point­ment of the Mid­dle class 

Since the 1979 rev­o­lu­tion, the Iran­ian soci­ety and its econ­o­my have been beset by a cost­ly eight-year war, unremit­ting inter­na­tion­al pres­sure and iso­la­tion, as well as ide­o­log­i­cal con­flict. The rev­o­lu­tion­ar­ies clashed over what con­sti­tut­ed an Islam­ic econ­o­my— and whether growth or social jus­tice should be the top pri­or­i­ty. In the last decen­nia, Iran’s socio-eco­nom­ic struc­ture wit­nessed dras­tic changes. In the begin­ning of the eight­ies, one of the main con­se­quences of the Iran-Iraq war was the eco­nom­ic adap­ta­tion pro­gram which com­plete­ly trans­formed the basis of soci­ety, set into motion by the Raf­san­jani admin­is­tra­tion (1989–1997) and which con­cen­trat­ed on the devel­op­ment of small and medi­um indus­tries and the inte­gra­tion of the Iran­ian econ­o­my in the glob­al econ­o­my. The obsta­cles and impli­ca­tions for the inter­nal mar­ket when in com­pe­ti­tion with the Chi­nese, cheap means of pro­duc­tion were seri­ous. A large part of the Iran­ian indus­try, espe­cial­ly con­sumer goods, was unable to com­pete with Chi­nese import. [17] 
An increas­ing glob­al­iza­tion, inter­na­tion­al eco­nom­ic cri­sis and inter­na­tion­al sanc­tions imposed on Iran, due to its for­eign poli­cies, in com­bi­na­tion with an ini­tial increase, fol­lowed by glob­al plum­met­ing, of oil prices has led to the for­ma­tion of oli­garchs, oper­at­ing in finan­cial and indus­tri­al domains on not only the inter­nal mar­kets, but who have addi­tion­al region­al ambi­tions as well. The Iran­ian econ­o­my became the stage of the pre­dictable ren­tier state prac­tices illus­trat­ed by a sol­id net­work of insti­tu­tion­al­ized cor­rup­tion which -through a vast net­work of polit­i­cal and reli­gious con­nec­tions was able to monop­o­lize the eco­nom­i­cal focal points. This net­work was main­ly com­prised through pow­er­ful groups in the gov­ern­ment, (para) mil­i­tary orga­ni­za­tions as well as pri­vate busi­ness­es. [18] 
Con­clu­sion 
It was the low­er mid­dle class that took the largest hit. Above-men­tioned devel­op­ments had a seri­ous impact on the vari­ety of eco­nom­ic sec­tors and more­over, had dras­tic social impli­ca­tions for the cleav­ages between the urban sphere and the rur­al one, between class­es and gen­ders, lead­ing to an increased inequal­i­ty as well as social dis­crim­i­na­tion. The pover­ty and mis­ery of the mass­es left the mid­dle class with its hands tied in tak­ing up the delib­er­at­ing role that the mid­dle class­es can play in giv­ing lever­age to the voic­es of the low­er and work­ing class. The recent upris­ings in var­i­ous parts of Iran are a man­i­fes­ta­tion of the eco­nom­ic mis­man­age­ment, the pre­dictable ren­tier state prac­tices and due to the insti­tu­tion­al­ized cor­rup­tion, there is no one to turn to for account­abil­i­ty. The ero­sion of the mid­dle class, divid­ing soci­ety even more on socio- eco­nom­ic cleav­ages, has shat­tered the ambi­tions of the work­ing and low­er- mid­dle class, hop­ing for social mobil­i­ty, while deal­ing with a decreas­ing stan­dard of life due to ris­ing unem­ploy­ment and rapid­ly dete­ri­o­rat­ing liv­ing con­di­tions. Although the hybrid char­ac­ter of Iran’s polit­i­cal sys­tem allows for some space for Ira­ni­ans to maneu­ver, the pop­u­la­tion, and espe­cial­ly the high­er mid­dle class is cau­tious to put its accom­plish­ments at risk. It is an increas­ing larg­er part of low­er class that will even­tu­al­ly pay the price for that. Iran’s rul­ing elite, that has been count­ing on the low­er class as its main con­stituen­cy, sees its legit­i­ma­cy fade. The Iran­ian regime will have to address some of above-men­tioned griev­ances and ques­tion the stran­gle­hold of the secu­ri­ty state, there­fore address­ing the root cause of Iran’s chron­ic unrest.
