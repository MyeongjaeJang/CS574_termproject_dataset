Justice League made less than any other DCEU movie Box office takings not as high as predicted. Text: Markus Hirsilä Published on the 25th of Mar 2018 at 09 
DC Comics movie Justice League gathered together a band of DC superheroes in one film: Batman, Cyborg, The Flash, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Superman. We saw them in action back in November 2017 off the back of a production process that was long, and that endured more than its fair shares of troubles. Maybe those troubles were the reason why the film wasn't as commercially successful as expected. 
According to Collider , Justice League made $657,924,295 worldwide, which is over $100 million less than 2013's Man of Steel. That movie has also been considered a disappointment for Warner Bros. 
So far the most successful DCEU movies are as follows: 
1. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice - $873,634,919 2. Wonder Woman - $821,847,012 4. Man of Steel - $668,045,518 5. Justice League - $657,924,295 
It must be said that Justice League wasn't a bad movie (you can read our review here ). The point is that the people were expecting something more, and this is being reflected in box office takings.
