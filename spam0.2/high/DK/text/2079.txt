Come Sesso | Come Tees x No Sesso 
Last Saturday, Come Sesso, a collaboration between Come Tees and No Sesso finally saw its birth in an explosion of rhythm, colour and joy (also known as a runway show). Sponsored by Nike and WeTransfer, the event took place at a warehouse near the banks of the Los Angeles River and featured live music from Venus X and ASMARA to showcase the brands’ fluid take on haute athleisure. 
Exemplifying L.A’s growing potential, the joining of these two forces represented a fashion revolution of wearable clothes and creative visions. Already boasting collaborations for the likes of Comme des Garçons and Eckhaus Latta, it’s only natural for Come Tees , Sonya Sombreuil’s streetwear line, and No Sesso , Pierre Davis’s gender-neutral brand, to team up. 
Dresses, shorts, trousers, jackets and, of course, t-shirts with mixing patterns and textures exuded intricate asymmetry and boasted loud graphic prints — making up a boldly brilliant and timelessly bright collection. Having already collectively attracted the attention of artists like Anderson .Paak , Mette Towley and SZA , Come Sesso challenges norms — in gender, fashion and culture — with its unisex approach, non-conforming attitude and careful craftsmanship. See it for yourself and get a feel of what went down on the runway and backstage last Saturday in front of the loudly cheerful L.A. crowd in the video above.
