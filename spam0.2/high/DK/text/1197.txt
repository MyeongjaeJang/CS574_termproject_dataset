This month sees the launch of Eurostar’s eagerly anticipated UKNetherlands service, with its slick, city centre to city centre offering, Wi-Fi connectivity and plenty of space to work or relax. This seems like the perfect opportunity to celebrate the collaboration between Scan Group (publisher of Scan Magazine, Discover Germany, and Discover Benelux) and world-leading distributor DMD, which circulates Scan Group’s publications in Eurostar’s business premier check-in office, among many other locations. At the end of last year, Scan Group passed the five million mark of the number of magazines distributed across flights, ferries, trains and airports in collaboration with DMD. Advertisement
