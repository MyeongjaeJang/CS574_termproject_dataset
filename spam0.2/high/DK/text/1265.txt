DayZ was one of the first games to appear on Early Access, with Bohemia's zombie-filled survival sim launching on Steam all the way back in 2013. Now it seems that there is some significant movement going on behind the scenes with the game set to get a reboot of sorts, and it's coming in just a couple of weeks' time. 
"We're releasing DayZ on a new engine in a couple of weeks on PC, and it's gonna be coming to Game Preview on Xbox this year," lead producer Eugen Harton told PCGamesN this week. "That's basically our aim. I would almost say it's a reboot of DayZ on PC." 
While Harton wouldn't be drawn on whether this means the game is about to leave Early Access, it does indicate that the project is picking up speed. The studio has previously suggested that DayZ would leave early access as well as head to Xbox in 2018 . 
Given the game's shared heritage with PUBG, comparisons are easy to make despite several huge differences. During the event producer Horton commented on the situation, explaining how "the hardcore simulation we're working on is not gonna compete with PUBG. It's not gonna compete with Fortnite [...] I think we have a different customer. I'm pretty sure of that." 
He then added: "It might not become a mainstream thing, but that's not our customer. I'm okay with that. I know what game I'm making - I don't want to appeal to everybody. I still feel like we have not hit our peak. This is the year of DayZ." Related texts
