Crazy Justice , a third-person online action game, is set to feature a Battle Royale mode, and it's coming to PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. With a release date scheduled for the end of May or June, Crazy Justice includes a destructible environment, cross-play between Switch, PC, and Xbox One, cartoonish graphics, 20 selectable heroes, and support for 100 players online (four player split-screen in story mode, two player mode in multiplayer). 
The studio, Welker Brothers, has now decided to highlight the Nintendo Switch version, which will support 60 frames per second gameplay even when played in portable mode. They even shared a video of the game running on the handheld console, which you can see below. Related texts
