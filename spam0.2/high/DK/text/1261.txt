Here at Gamereactor we really appreciated Firewatch, the amazing first-person narrative adventure developed by Campo Santo and released in 2016 on PC, PS4, and Xbox One. Today the studio has announced that the game is ready to debut on a new platform, more specifically on the Nintendo Switch. 
Firewatch's launch on Nintendo's hybrid console is scheduled for this spring, although at the moment a final launch date hasn't been revealed. We hope to receive more information on this version soon, especially to find out if and how the unique features of Switch will be utilised. Related texts
