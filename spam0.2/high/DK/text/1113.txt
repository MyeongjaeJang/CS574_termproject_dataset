BMW Financial Services is launching Access by BMW, a vehicle subscription service on the US markets to give users access to BMW vehicles for a monthly fee that covers maintenance, insurance and roadside assistance. 
Prices range from $2,000 to $3,700 a month. 
There is no limit to how often users can switch vehicles within a given month. 
At the start-up phase, Access by BMW offers two tiers. The Legend tier is comprised of BMW sedans, coupes, convertibles and SUVs. The M tier offers M models such as the M4 convertible, the M5, the M6 convertible and the performance SUVs X5M and X6M.
