Players concerned with lack of customisation in Sea of Thieves Executive producer Jon Neate has even commented on this. Text: Magnus Groth-Andersen Published on the 21st of Mar 2018 at 11 
Sea of Thieves is finally out, and while reviews are still trickling in slowly, some players who have recently been let loose in Rare's world are worried about the apparent lack of any proper customisation options. 
The complaints have recently flooded into the game's official Reddit page , where users are saying things like: "You have to understand I only actually would go out of my way to buy 2 of the existing options I've seen. This means I've achieved my 'ideal' character look within a couple of purchases (with little to no alternatives worth my time) and now the entire 'cosmetics' progression is finished." 
Another wrote: "I'm a big defender of the game but I too was a little disappointed with the amount of options presented. I expected there to be more than what was in the Final Beta." 
Now, IGN has reached out for a comment from Rare, and got an official reply from Executive Producer Joe Neate, who said that Sea of Thieves is "a game that grows and evolves, and we will release new cosmetic options ongoing as part of that."
