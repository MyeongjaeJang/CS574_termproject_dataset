Super Meat Boy Forever: "you can do a lot with two buttons" We talked to Meat Boy creator Tommy Refenes at PAX East. Text: Mike Holmes Published on the 9th of Apr 2018 at 09 
Some of you will remember Tommy Refenes after this appearance in Indie Game: The Movie, where the game he made with Edmund McMillen - Super Meat Boy - featured prominently. Now, after some years spent working on a Mew-Genics (which, alas, never saw the light of day), Refenes is back and so is Meat Boy, this time in the form of Super Meat Boy Forever . 
We caught up with the developer at PAX East and found out a bit more about the upcoming sequel to one of the most popular indie platformers ever made. 
"It's a little different because instead of just having like 600 static levels we actually generate levels," Refenes explained to us in Boston. "Each level has about a hundred smaller, little Meat Boy levels in it that we mash together to make a longer, bigger level for this game because it just sorta fits the style of you're just running through and you're punching and ducking and that kind of stuff." 
"In a way, it is easier to pick up and play because we've taken away the ability to like switch your directions and stuff, but it's still a very difficult game, so we got rid of the barrier of entry of dexterity and now it's just all reactionary. So you can actually do a lot with two buttons, and that's turned into quite a cool design challenge." 
Super Meat Boy Forever is set to land in either Q3 or Q4 of this year, at least that's what Refenes is aiming for, and in terms of the platforms it'll be appearing on: "whatever you like playing video games on, it's going to be on." 
Dreamcast version confirmed?
