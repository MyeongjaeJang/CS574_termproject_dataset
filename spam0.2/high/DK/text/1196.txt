“We will continue to promote our core values for the secondary school students,” explains Ms. Hertay. “These core values include creating a family-like environment, considering the individual needs of the student, using rigorous international curricula for each phase of development and providing them with the values and attributes they need to become global citizens.” At primary level, BEPS follows the International Primary Curriculum (IPC), a comprehensive, thematic, creative curriculum, offering a clear process of learning and specific learning goals for each subject. International mindedness and personal learning are high on the agenda. Advertisement
