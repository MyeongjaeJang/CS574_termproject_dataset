New costumes for Super Mario Odyssey A sporty one and that's perhaps more apt for Super Mario Galaxy. Text: Islem Sharouda Published on the 29th of Mar 2018 at 16 
If you have restarted your Super Mario Odyssey game in search of missing Power Moons, you have certainly noticed that now, two new costumes are available if you want to switch up Mario's iconic plumber outfit. 
As confirmed by Nintendo of America, two new outfits await you at Crazy Cap. The first is a baseball outfit, including a Batting Helmet and a Baseball Uniform. The second is giving off a retro space vibe and is called the Satellaview Suit & Helmet. 
What do you think of these new outfits and are you still playing Super Mario Odyssey ? Related texts
