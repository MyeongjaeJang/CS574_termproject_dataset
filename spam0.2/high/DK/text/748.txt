Soap Vet Michael M. Ryan Dead Pubblicato il da grognards March 5, 2017 
Earlier this week, the soap world lost Another World soap vet, Michael M. Ryan when he passed away on Wednesday, March 1. The talented actor portrayed John Randolph from 1964 until 1979 when his character died. 
Interestingly, acting wasn’t Ryan’s first choice in a career. He was with the US Navy and received a degree in Foreign Service from Georgetown. From there, Ryan decided to pursue acting and eventually landed the role of John on Another World. 
Soap Hub sends our condolences to his family. A memorial will be held on Monday for Ryan at the Church of the Nativity in Leawood, Kansas. Below, you can watch a clip of Ryan as John in an episode of Another World.
