Hybrid 
A petrol engine that is as fuel efficient as a diesel but costs less? It is possible, Volkswagen claims, thanks to the new micro-hybrid powertrain of the Golf. It is based on the new 1.5 TSI petrol unit, which already had the capability to shut down two of its four cylinders at low loads to safe fuel. When combined with the DSG, the new micro hybrid can actually shut down its engine entirely and disconnect the transmission while coasting, saving up to 0.4/l100 km. 
VW has yet another trick up its sleeve: the 1.5 TSI ACT BlueMotion, as it is called, makes use of the Miller combustion process combined with a variable turbo charger. All technical tricks combined, the VW Golf offers a 10% enhanced fuel efficiency. Its combined CO2 emissions are rated at 110 g/km, according to the old NEDC method. The highly-efficient TSI will find its way to other VW products soon. In the future, it will also be combined with 48V (mild hybrid) and high-voltage (full hybrid) batteries.
