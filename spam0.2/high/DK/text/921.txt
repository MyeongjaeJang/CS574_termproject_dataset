Phoenix Hire and Sales Ltd provides top quality tools and plant for domestic or industrial use at highly competitive prices. 
In addition to our stores in Cwmbran, Bridgend and Cardiff, we are also pleased to announce the launch of our new flagship showroom in Pontypridd! This concludes the first stage of the £25K refurbishment at our newest depot. The next stage of this development will be new external signage and window graphics which we are hoping to see in the Spring subject to planning permission. 
We hope the new look store will instantly benefit all our customers, old and new. Pontypridd now hosts a wealth of new product across all our operating sectors including STIHL / VIKING, BOSCH, PASLODE and many more. The fresh new look, combined with enhanced staff product training ensures this depot is completely up to date and informative with all our customers’ requirements.
