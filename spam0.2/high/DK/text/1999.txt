Team Target International 
Californian start-up Reviver Auto is in talks with the Dubai Road and Transport Authority to roll out its Rplate digital licence plate concept as part of Dubai’s Smart City Initiative. 
The company is working with the authority on a new international agreement for a proof of concept program in partnership with local distributor Team Target International. 
Connecting vehicles plate-by-plate 
Reviver Auto chief executive officer Neville Boston said: “The global adoption of the Rplate Pro coincides with our mission to establish a universal connected vehicle innovation platform. We’re not just reinventing the connected vehicle ecosystem, we’re building safer and more connected communities one licence plate at a time.” 
The company already has agreements in several USA states including California, Arizona, Florida and Texas. 
Abdullah Yousuf Al Ali, CEO of Dubai Road and Transport Authority licensing agency, said: “It’s our vision to make Dubai the smartest city in the world and the Rplate Pro will be a key part of our transport infrastructure.” Authored by: Alison Campbell
