The GRTV team are in Boston for this year's PAX East, and they've been busy. Besides the interviews we've been filming (which you'll see appear on the site in the coming days) we've been playing plenty of games, and you can see a range of different titles in the gameplay clips attached below. However, before you settle in and watch a mix of direct and over-the-shoulder capture, check out our update from day three of PAX East 2018.
