Lawbreakers , Gears of War -skaberen Cliff Bleszinskis modsvar på karakterdrevne skydespil som Overwatch , udkom sidste august, men det blev ganske hurtigt tydeligt, at spillet ikke formåede at finde et fast, trofast publikum, og derfra gik det bare ned af bakke. Derfor har udvikleren nu afsløret, at de har valgt at sætte udviklingen af nyt indhold på pause. 
Via et længere indlæg på udviklerens hjemmeside fortæller Boss Key Productions, at de har i sinde at bevæge sig videre til andre projekter i stedet for at fortsætte udviklingen af nyt indhold til Lawbreakers . 
"It has been a while since we said anything about LawBreakers. With that, the past four months at Boss Key Productions has been especially trying, as we pride ourselves at being communicative and transparent. 
So here is the very real truth, which may not come as a surprise. 
The fact is LawBreakers failed to find enough of an audience to generate the funds necessary to keep it sustained in the manner we had originally planned for and anticipated. And while a pivot to free-to-play may seem like [the] easiest change to make, a change of this magnitude takes publishing planning and resources to do it. 
The team here has worked hard on this game over the past three and a half years and our studio is determined to give this game the second life it deserves. However, between now and then, we cannot sit idle. We will continue to support the game in its current state, but we also need to focus on other projects with fresh creative leaders. We have been working on something new and we can't wait to share more about it. It's a passion project that we're in complete control of. 
Thank you for your ongoing understanding and patience." 
Studiets næste spil er ikke relateret til Lawbreakers , og udgiveren Nexon er heller ikke involveret. Relaterede tekster
