Not much happened today – office work, sealing my day hatch, and John and Josh went out playing in plastic kayaks, but didn’t get on the water due to a broken zippper at John’s dry suit. We all three joined Martha on her local music event, and I very much enjoyed being immersed in local American culture. Some amazing artists out there!
