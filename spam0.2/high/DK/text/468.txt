Photography by Igor Oussenko moves us to a building of solitude in this Schön! online editorial. Julia Barieva creates a playfully demure aesthetic, accessing brands such as Céline, DKNY and Stella McCartney. Yana Koptyakova plays with warm tones across hair and make up, giving an air of nostalgia to the final images. Top / Celine
