Donkey Kong Country on Switch requires 6.6GB of storage That's half the original requirement. Text: Sergio Figueroa Published on the 23rd of Mar 2018 at 14 
Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze is the next Nintendo port for the Switch after Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Pokk√©n Tournament Deluxe - a new opportunity in a broader market for the acclaimed Wii U game - but we've actually just found out that the new version takes up half the space that the original did. 
Nintendo Japan says on the oficial website that you'll need 6.6GB of space to download the digital version of DKC: Tropical Freeze, instead of the 11.4GB taken by the old one. There's no comment on the reason, but we suspect that it has something to do with the compression of the assets and how the Switch handles loading times. 
Even though this is a port of a game released four years ago, many people are complaining on forums and social media that Nintendo are still charging full price. Do you agree with them?
