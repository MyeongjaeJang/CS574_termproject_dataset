VaingloryFire guides 
SAW has arguably the highest damage potential in the game … but at the huge expense of mobility. Excellent at sieging important locations, SAW zones out entire regions from the enemy team with Suppressing Fire. Try starting him in lane, earn as much gold as possible, then make your presence felt wherever needed. ABOUT THE FREE HERO ROTATION 
The free hero rotation unlocks six heroes each week to play as long and as much as you want in the Casual queue . It’s an opportunity to test drive heroes before using ICE or Glory to unlock them. 
The free rotation changes every Tuesday and heroes in the rotation usually won’t return for a few weeks or months afterward, so unlocking heroes is always worthwhile. The free rotation does not apply to Ranked play to ensure players are already very familiar with the heroes they play in that try-hard environment with skill tiers at stake.
