Epic is considering more than 100 players for Fortnite The studio is also looking at better ways to integrate PvP and PvE. Text: David Kers   10 
Epic's increasingly popular Fortnite: Battle Royale is currently set up to facilitate shenanigans between a maximum of 100 players, but that may change in the future. In the latest issue of Official PlayStation Magazine, design lead Eric Williamson has talked positively about the idea of increasing the player cap per match. 
"One of the things we've been talking about is, 'does it make sense to ever consider more than a hundred players?' I think there's a lot of technological considerations for something like that. I mean, personally, I would love to try it. I don't see it in our near future but, hey, why not?" 
In the same interview, Williamson also revealed that Epic is looking at better ways to integrate the PvP and PvE modes, where classes can make a big difference. 
"It's a tough problem to solve because they're different paces of game. Battle Royale is a 15-20 minute digestible experience whereas Save The World is an RPG with progressive elements. It's not something that is easy to map from one to the other. Certainly we would love to try and be in that sort of space, but there's a lot of problems trying to get there. Each class has different collision 'volumes' on the different characters. If we were to put those classes into Battle Royale everyone would gravitate towards the one that has the smallest 'hitbox'."
