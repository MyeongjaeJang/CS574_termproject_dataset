Minecraft player's bomb threat closed 400 UK schools Disgruntled customers and cybercriminals suggested as culprits. Text: Magnus Groth-Andersen Published on the 21st of Mar 2018 at 14 
Two days ago, over 400 schools in the UK were forced to close temporarily after a series of bomb threats were sent out via email, allegedly by a Minecraft player. Multiple reports have revealed that the threat was tied to the popular game after the emails were sent by a supposedly fake email account from VeltPvP. 
VeltPvP is a Minecraft server site, and the imposter asked for $5,000 and wrote that if their demands were not met then a bomb carried by an unknowing student on his or her way to school would go off. 
Shortly after the threat was issued, the affected schools were closed until a few hours later where the police concluded that there was no threat. VeltPvP themselves also issued a statement , speculating that the threat may have originated from cybercriminals who have been harassing the site. 
"We have nothing to do with the bomb threats that were sent out to the 400+ UK schools.We've been being harassed by a group of cybercriminals that are trying to harass us in anyway possible. We're extremely sorry for anyone who had to deal with this, but just know it's fake." 
Later, the company's 17-year-old CEO, Carson Kallen, told the BBC that: "Every now and then we have a little rebel who will try to do something bad like this. We've had stuff like this happen before but nothing this extreme." 
Counter to the statement released on Twitter, Kallen suggested that it "was probably a player who got banned from our server and got mad. This is his way of trying to make us look bad." Related texts
