Michael Morris from the local kayak club “”Explore North Coast” paddled this early morning up to our beach with his self-made stitch’n-glue Pygmy kayak and handcrafted Greenland paddles. Nice to see a fellow kayaker on the water! He was the one organizing our stay with Damon Maguire tonight. Thanks! We had a nice chat, and surely invited him to paddle along over to Eureka, but he politely rejected the offer with the answer it would be “quite a boring” paddle…well, besides the company, I hope…! 
The rest was so true…a long monotonous beach, dead calm water and no wind, and quite an offshore paddle…conditions which really make me falling asleep…if Franca and I wouldn’t be intensely chatting about this and that most of the time…still we both felt our sore bodies form last day’s long paddle, and were mutually fighting sores and tiredness. 
A bunch of Gray whales kept us entertained, and a crab fishing boat tried to scare us with the “rushing out water” out of the entrance of the Humboldt Bay, if we wouldn’t arrive in time…guys, we are paddling slower than your boat drives, but we are aware of the tides…! Thanks for the hint! High tide was at 4 pm, and we perfectly arrived just before to still get a bit of a suck into the bay. 
Michael was waiting on the spot to pick us up, and to drive us to Damon’s nice house north of Arcata. thanks to both to be so helpful! The ladies invited the guys for dinner in return… 
The forecast for the next days looks not really inviting, we could maybe paddle tomorrow, but then we would be stuck. We have to figure something out now…
