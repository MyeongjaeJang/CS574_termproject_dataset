Car parts 
The car aftermarket in the Middle East and Africa, valued at $22 billion in 2017, is expected to grow by 7% each year over the next five years, reports the Saudi Gazette, based on a whitepaper by analysts TechSci Research. 
Tyres account for the lion's share of sales in both regions, followed by engine oils, lubricants and coolants. 
The newspaper reports that fleet owners appear to be focusing on maintaining their vehicles for longer periods, thereby boosting the car aftermarket. 
Vehicle sales are expected to grow across the region and Saudi Arabia's new decree allowing women to drive will also result in higher sales figures.
