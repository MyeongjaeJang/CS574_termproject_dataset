Brazil The Brazil unit of international vehicle fleet management company Arval is expecting to grow its fleet by 11% in 2018, due to the growing trend of companies outsourcing their fleet and switching over to long term renting, Brazil CEO Nuno Silva told Global Fleet. “This is a bit higher than the 9% rise expected from the industry overall,” Silva said during an interview . Last year, the company saw a 14% increase in fleet size year-over-year while the industry saw a rise of about 4%, according to the executive. Falling under French banking group BNP Paribas, Arval Brazil has a fleet of some 24,000 vehicles.
