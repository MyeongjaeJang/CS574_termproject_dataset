Englewood Police said in a statement the rapper, whose real name is John Jackson, turned himself in at 8:30 p.m. Wednesday on a domestic dispute and making terroristic threat charge. He was released from police custody. Court documents show the alleged crime stemmed from an earlier incident on March 7, when Jackson while in Los Angeles on a business trip “became enraged” when he found out via Instagram the victim was also in Los Angeles. According to an affidavit of probable cause, while on a flight back from Los Angeles, the victim told police that Jackson, 40, said via text he wanted to hit her in the head with a baseball bat and that he would kill her but he “did not want to go out like that.” The victim told police she was scared because of the March 7 incident.
