Releasing this Week: March 26 - April 1 There are no April fools here. Text: Mike Holmes Published on the 26th of Mar 2018 at 17 
As we prepare for Easter weekend and all of the extra time that means in front of the television, there are some interesting titles to look forward to, including one stand out release that we're sure many of you are looking forward to getting stuck into. 
March 27 : The weeks kicks off on Tuesday as per, and the brilliantly/terribly named Atelier Lydie & Suelle: The Alchemists and the Mysterious Paintings (PC, PS4, Switch) is being joined by Batman: The Enemy Within - Episode Five: Same Stitch (PC, PS4, Xbox One), which marks the end of the second season of this particular Telltale series. The big one is obviously Far Cry 5 (PC, PS4, Xbox One), and you can read our review here for more on why it's probably worth you pick it up. 
Add to that there's the Legendary Edition of Injustice 2 (PC, PS4, Xbox One), MLB The Show 18 (PS4), Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition (PC), Outlast 2 (Switch), and Shroud of the Avatar: Forsaken Virtues (PC). Add that lot together and you've got yourself a very busy day. 
March 28 : It gets a bit easier to digest from here on in, with just Golem Gates (PC) releasing the next day. 
March 29 : Same again, this time it's the early access release of Long Gone Days (Early Access, PC). 
March 30 : We're getting two at the end of the working week, despite it being Good Friday, and that's STAY (PC) and Terrorhythm TRRT (Early Access, PC). 
March 31 : Finally, there's a Saturday release over on PC in the form of Make Sail (Early Access, PC). You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now ! Ã—
