The best thing about the new year? That the old makes space for the new: after all, the upcoming season has many fresh interior trends on offer. What is new, what stays, and what trends come from other cities? The PAD designers took a look around and have implemented the most important in uences from fashion, architecture, music and art into their brand-new collection. PAD concentrates on one large trend: switching off, taking deep breaths, refuel- ling. The more hectic and complex our outside lives become, the calmer we design our interiors. Thereby, clear lines, minimalism in form and colour, as well as calming natural materials help us. Especially on trend: textured surfaces that guarantee a beautiful, haptic experience and thus, are a big contrast to our smartphonesâ€™ cold, smooth surfaces. Advertisement
