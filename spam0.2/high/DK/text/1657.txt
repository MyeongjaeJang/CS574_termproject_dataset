Rumour: Kingdom Hearts III to be released in November Target may have spilled the beans. Text: Jonas MÃ¤ki Published on the 12th of Apr 2018 at 11 
After having been silent for years, Square Enix has finally started to reveal more and more about the upcoming Kingdom Hearts III, but one thing we still don't know much about is when the game will be launched, other than that it's expected to happen this year. Now we might have the answer to that thanks to the American retailer Target, who earlier today listed November 1 as the release date. 
That would be a Thursday and totally reasonable (even though Tuesdays are most common in America). However, when this was noticed by (among others) ComicBook.com , Target rapidly removed the date and exchanged it for December 31, which is the standard placeholder dates for games coming this year but with no specific date confirmed. 
Leaks like these from bigger stores (which Target is) often turn out to be correct, but we still need to stress that this is by no means an official confirmation. How excited are you to get back into Kingdom Hearts? Related texts
