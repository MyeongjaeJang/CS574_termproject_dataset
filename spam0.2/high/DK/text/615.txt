Today on Gamereactor Live we're playing South Park: The Fractured but Whole and more specifically the new DLC, From Dusk till Casa Bonita. Mysterion's sister is hanging out with the Vamp kids who have taken over Cartman's favourite eatery, Casa Bonita. 
We'll start streaming the DLC at 3:00pm BST (16:00 CEST), and as usual you can catch the two-hour stream on the dedicated Gamereactor Live page . Related texts
