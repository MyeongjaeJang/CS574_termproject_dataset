Today on GR Live we're playing Darwin Project It's kill or be killed in today's stream. Text: Mike Holmes Published on the 22nd of Mar 2018 at 09 
Everyone seems to be enjoying last man standing games at the moment, whether they be standalone games based solely on the concept or existing titles that are expanding with modes of their own. We're no different, and one Battle Royale-inspired game that has caught our attention in recent months is Darwin Project . 
Scavengers' offering mixes things up with a lower player count, light crafting, and an additional player acting as director. It makes for an interesting alternative to the likes of PUBG and Fortnite, and so we're going to be playing the game today at 3pm GMT / 4pm CET. So tune in over on GR Live this afternoon to see the team tackle this innovative take on the last man standing genre. Related texts
