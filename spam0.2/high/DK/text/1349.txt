Shaq-Fu: A Legend Reborn gets a release date A new trailer plus exclusive PAX gameplay inside. Text: Mike Holmes Published on the 8th of Apr 2018 at 09 
Shaq-Fu: A Legend Reborn has a confirmed release date, and players looking forward to a return of the cult classic in the form of this tongue-in-cheek sequel will be able to pick it up on PC, PS4, Switch and Xbox One (it's $30 or regional equivalent on all platforms except Switch, whose players have to pay an extra $10 for some reason). A release date trailer landed yesterday and you can see it below, along with some gameplay that we just captured in Boston at PAX East 2018. Related texts
