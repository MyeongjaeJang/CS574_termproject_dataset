Austrian architect Wolfgang Reicht plans eccentric landmark buildings in both China and India, but more and more strives to implement his generalistic approach in Europe as well. Unique, courageous, iconic: Reicht buildings are like rock stars. Those who have seen projects like the ‘Dalian Planning Museum’ or the ‘Changxing Island sport center’ in China know that also for identity-forming buildings, function and form do not need to contradict each other. “Architecture means identification,” ex- plains Wolfgang Reicht.“That kind of holistic spirit needs to be palpable to create added value. To reach this goal, you need a good client and an architect who knows how to effectively combine technology and emotion, spatial experience and interior design.” Advertisement
