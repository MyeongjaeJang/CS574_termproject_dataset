Battle Royale is Crossout's new mode And it comes with a new map called Blood Rocks. Text: Fabrizia Malgieri Published on the 7th of Apr 2018 at 13 
The last player standing revolution doesn't want to stop, and this week Targem Games and Gaijin Entertainment have announced a new PvP mode for their post-apocalyptic vehicle-shooter Crossout , and it's called Battle Royale. In this new mode, 32 players will fight each other on the new Blood Rocks map, where they will have to look for weapons and equipment to improve their starting vehicle, and where only the best player will emerge as the winner. 
As in any Battle Royale mode, players will start with modest equipment, and in this case, you'll have a lightweight buggy without weapons and equipment, which players will improve and modify as soon as they find materials and objects around the map. Each vehicle can support up to two firearms, a melee weapon, and an auxiliary module. The installed modules can be exchanged at any time with the other many objects that players will find on the battlefield. 
The interesting part of this mode is that the buggy available to players has a very sturdy frame, which means that players won't be able to shoot the tires out as usually happens in standard Crossout battles. In fact, to be able to knock down an opponent, players will have to completely destroy their opponent's vehicle. 
The Blood Rocks map will naturally be the largest playable location present in Crossout to date and it's 16 times larger of the average PvP maps available in the game. It's characterised by a network of caves, large areas with ruined buildings, and other remnants of the old world which offer shelters. To further complicate matters, there will also be an unpredictable sandstorm that will constantly move around the battlefield, capturing vehicles and destroying them in seconds. Sounds interesting. 
Battle Royale is already available in Crossout. Related texts
