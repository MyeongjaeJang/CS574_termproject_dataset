The LMP2 team Cetilar Villorba Corse will continue with the same line-up in 2018. 
The Italian team participates in the European Le Mans Series, and have received an entry for the 24 Hours of Le Mans as well. 
Team boss Christian Pescatori once again opted for Andrea Belicchi, Roberto Lacorte og Giorgio Sernagiotto. 
The two latter drivers will do their 9th season together, while Belicchi was a new man at the team in 2017l Belicchi has both LMP1 and LMP2 experience from other times, where he among many other things, raced for Rebellion Racing through many seasons. Cetilar Villorba Corse #47Photo: JJ Media 
The team ended up 9th in the ELMS LMP2 standings in 2017, but also had issues with the Dallara P217 chassis, which had a tendency to become unstable at high speed. Dallara has solved that problem for 2018, with their new upgraded bodywork, so that gives the team hopes for moving forward in the Championship standings. 
The European Le Mans Series starts with their Prologue at Paul Ricard on 9-10 April, before the first race of the year will be run on 15 April at the same circuit.
