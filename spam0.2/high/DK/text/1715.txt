Philosophy is said to be the mother of all disciplines. It is the oldest of all disciplines and gave rise to modern science as we know it today as both social and natural sciences have their roots in philosophy.

Understanding philosophy and of course, the way problems are addressed by philosophers is therefore the key to understanding of science as we know it today. Haupteigenschaften
