Super Bomberman R was released exclusively for Nintendo Switch last year, but on June 12 other platforms will finally be able to join in. The game launches on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but surprisingly these versions all launch with a special character associated with that particular platform. 
On PlayStation 4, players will be able to select Ratchet as their character of choice. On Xbox One, it's Master Chief himself, and on PC it's Portal's P-Body. 
All three characters have now received their own trailers, so see them in action below. Related texts
