Report: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered without multiplayer Rumours peg Beenox as the developer and that there will be no multiplayer. Text: Markus Hirsil√§ Published on the 22nd of Mar 2018 at 12 
Ever since Activision did a remastered version of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare back in November 2016 people have been wondering what other games in the series will be getting the remaster treatment. Earlier this year Activision stated that there will be more coming in the future. 
Now the folks at Charlie Intel report that, according to their sources, the next remaster will be Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered. However, there's a catch: it's single player only. And as we all know: multiplayer is the bread and butter of Call of Duty. 
Another thing of note is that the Remastered version is not being developed by Raven Software, who was responsible for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered. According to the report, development is being handled by Beenox, a team that previously helped Raven Software in developing the campaign of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered. 
If Charlie Intel's sources are correct, then Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered would cost $25, which is a lot lower than what Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered was initially ($40 in June 2017). 
If all of this intel is solid, then maybe Activision wants to sell Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer as a separate game? Or perhaps they turn it into a monthly subscription service? Or perhaps they simply don't want it to compete for players with Call of Duty: Black Ops 4? Leave your comments below. Related texts
