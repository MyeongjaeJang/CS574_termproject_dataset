Another retailer lists Diablo III for the Switch Could it be mere coincidence? Text: Markus Hirsil√§ Published on the 22nd of Mar 2018 at 11 
For the past month or so there have been rumours about Diablo III coming to the Nintendo Switch. Blizzard was quick to shoot down speculation at the time, but maybe there is something coming after all? 
Now a UK based online retailer called Coolshop has listed Diablo III for the Nintendo Switch, with the description stating that "unfortunately, the manufacturer has not yet announced an estimated delivery date". 
This is by no means a confirmation, and - as stated - Blizzard has officially denied that Diablo III would be coming to Nintendo's console. But might that be misdirection on the part of Blizzard, or is this just another retailer looking to get some traffic with a fake listing? Time will tell, but the evidence, circumstantial as it may be, is starting to pile up. Related texts
