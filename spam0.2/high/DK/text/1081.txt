Whoever pays attention to quality when buying pearls will enjoy the jewellery for a lifetime. The online store perlenforum.de offers high-quality pearls for a competitive price – as a necklace, pendant or earrings, in natural white, rose, grey or gold, from ve to 20 millimetres in diameter. For more than 16 years now, founder Sabine Ueberschaer has dedicated her life to pearls. “I discovered the topic accidentally. I have lived in Peking for many years and in an attempt to improve my Chinese language skills, I talked a lot with pearl dealers,” she says about the period when she started gathering knowledge about the versatile colours and shapes of Chinese freshwater pearls.
