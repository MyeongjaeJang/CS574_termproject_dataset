Those who have been to Asia before know the importance of handing over oneâ€™s business card in this region. Walter Ringl, owner of a jewellery manufactory in Austria, has taken this ceremony as inspiration to design a special packaging that adds even more exclusivity to this important process. Cardissimo is a case for credit and business cards which impresses with its simple form and highest quality. It is easy and safe to use and in addition, credit cards are protected against outside access from scanners in the carbon case. Manufactured in a jewellery manufactory under close monitoring, highest quality and precision are guaranteed. Besides offering their carbon model, Cardissimo also has cases made out of natural woods in store. Advertisement
