Play-Asia accuses game media of creating 'puritanical climate' There are claims the media has demonised certain "content types." Text: Jonas MÃ¤ki   16 
Games with an obvious sex theme are fairly common in Asia, but not so much in the western world where distributors simply decide not to release those games. This even includes bigger titles like Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 that already had an English translation included in the Asian version, which would have made a US launch very easy. 
Play-Asia is one of the biggest stores where gamers go to get their Asian games that simply aren't released over here, and they claim in a Twitter discussion that it's the media's fault that games with sexual themes are hard to get in large parts of the world: 
"SJWnonsense = hostile climate for games w/ sex themes. A direct result of games media. Even if some didn't have a vendetta against DOA when they were oblivious to its existence doesn't mean they didn't contribute to TN's stated issue with the puritanical climate created," they wrote. 
Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 became a huge hit for Play-Asia as many gamers, likely as a protest, bought the game from them. Koei Tecmo themselves posted the following on Facebook in 2015, explaining why they didn't release the game in the west: 
"Do you know many issues happening in video game industry with regard to how to treat female in video game industry? We do not want to talk those things here. But certainly we have gone through in last year or two to come to our decision. Thank you." 
What's more is that, when questioned if they're against games media in general, Play-Asia wrote: "I'd say there is a significant difference between anti-games media and disliking journalism centered on demonizing an entire content types. We enjoy the vast majority of games media." 
What do you make of this entire situation?
