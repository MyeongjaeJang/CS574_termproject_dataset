BCCherish Ladies Conference : Dear Daughter April 21 : 10:00 am - 4:00 pm | £15.00 BCCherish : 5th ASPIRE : LADIES CONFERENCE 
Hi Ladies 
Why not reserve the date in your diaries and join us for our annual ladies conference here at Bethany Church Manchester. For those of you who have attended previously you know that you are in for a precious time away from your day to day life, where God will meet with you in a special way. As you relax and enjoy the company of old friends and make some new ones, you will experience the joy of worshipping our God, led by the wonderfully gifted Helen Yousaf. 
We have invited Pastor Esther Scholes, from Morecombe to be a guest speaker and she has a special message of hope to share with you. Our pastor’s wife Katie Meggers will be bringing you a word of encouragement. Fiona Taylor, a member of Bethany will also be a speaker at this event. 
MercyUK and PaisUK will be represented and there will be interviews and a chance to find out more about the charities that we love. You will also have opportunities for some pampering and be able to purchase gifts that give back to disadvantaged communities. 
Come prepared to be refreshed and to receive a fresh revelation of your name and status as “daughter.”
