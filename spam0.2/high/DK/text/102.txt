Background 
At the Warsaw Summit 2016, NATO member states decided to enhance the military presence in the Eastern part of the alliance. Subsequently, troops have been deployed to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Danish troops arrived in Estonia in January 2018, and now form part of a UK-led battle group. 
The Danish military presence is a result of the implemented enhanced Forward Presence (eFP), which is a deployed defence and deterrence posture designed to deter possible Russian aggression against the eFP host countries. Often referred to as a “tripwire”, the rationale behind the eFP presence is to make the possible costs to Russia unacceptable, if launching an attack on any of the host states. It is largely about signalling commitment. 
This seminar looks at the eFP from the ground in Estonia, before offering a wider perspective on the future of NATO in the region, its conflict management and deterrence.
