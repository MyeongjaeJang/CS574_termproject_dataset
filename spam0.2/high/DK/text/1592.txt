Dauntless enters open beta on May 24 Free-to-play behemoth hunting game set to be released in the wild. Text: Bengt Lemne   14 
Developer Phoenix Labs has announced that free-to-play co-operative behemoth hunter Dauntless will enter its open beta phase on May 24. As is customary these days, the developer points out in the press release that the items you'll buy in the in-game shop are vanity and cosmetic, and that there will not be any form of loot boxes. 
"Dauntless is more than four years in the making, and we can't wait for everyone to join us in the Shattered Isles, team up with friends, take on Behemoths, craft epic gear and bring the world to life," said Jesse Houston, CEO and co-founder of Phoenix Labs via the press release. "As we close in on our next phase of this adventure, we thank our passionate community that has been with us from day-one, providing feedback and helping craft the experience into what it is today. It has been an honor to create Dauntless together with you!" 
The game is currently only coming to PC, but Phoenix Labs are looking at console opportunities as well.
