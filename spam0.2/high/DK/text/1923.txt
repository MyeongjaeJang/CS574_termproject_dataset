Jelly Mario is a very weird version of Super Mario Bros Up there with the strangest we've seen, at least. Text: Petter Hegevall Published on the 15th of Apr 2018 at 10 
The internet is a hub for weird and wonderful things, be it mods that turn Skyrim's spiders into Spider-Man (no joke) or videos of cats playing the piano, and now programmer Stefan Hedman - who is great at creating strange stuff - had brought something else to the table. 
His newest project, Jelly Mario, is anything but normal. What could it be though? Using blocks of jelly to control Mario? Well no, as in this Mario himself is made out of jelly, and as such reaching the end of the level is super hard, as you can see if you dare to try the game out here . 
Do you think Jelly Mario is a good Mario? Related texts
