Join The Social Business Club miniconference 8 May in Copenhagen 
Consumers expect companies to take clear stands on social and environmental issues. Purpose-driven employees and intrapreneurs are driving change from within the company by aligning sustainability efforts with business objectives. Entrepreneurs are taking a new approach to activism by using their business as a vehicle for social change. 
Corporate social activism is on the rise. How can business be an activist force for good? 
What are the faces of corporate social activism? Why should companies go beyond being responsible to taking a stand? (How) can companies embrace this trend as an opportunity to take their responsibility and sustainability efforts to the next level and drive social change? And is there a limit as to how far a company can go? 
These are all questions we will be exploring at our Spring miniconference in The Social Business Club on 8 May in Copenhagen. Get real-life insights & practical advice on the 8th of May 
By drawing on the hands-on experience of practitioners who have applied corporate social activism in different ways, the miniconference offers valuable insights and concrete inspiration from: The international social business specialist who provides an overview of global trends and cases on corporate social activism (Tania Ellis, Special Advisor & Founder, The Social Business Company) The retail giant that applies choice editing and controversial communication to inform and engage its consumers in sustainable consumption (Thomas Roland, CSR Manager, COOP Danmark) The low-cost telecommunications company that initiated a national social movement by changing the company from within (Hanne Lindblad, former CEO and Anja Enggaard former Marketing Manager, Call me) The world’s first ethical prison labour company that uses its business to take a stand on poverty and women’s rights. (Veronica D’Souza, CEO & Founder, CARCEL) 
Throughout the programme we will discuss, network and exchange experience and thoughts on why, if and how companies can become activists for social change.
