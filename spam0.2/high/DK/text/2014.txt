HOME WITHOUT A HOUSE: A CITY WALK AROUND NORDVEST 
A guided tour to Nordvest, The Youth House and Kirkens Korshær (En guidede tur til Nordvest, Ungdoms Huset og Kirkens Korshær) 
What turns a house into a home? Is it possible to have a home without a house? What creates a sense of belonging? Through the act of urban walking we can develop knowledge about our periphery, about what is external to us but still affect us. Walking becomes a strong perceptive experience where none of the senses is neglected. Perceive our surroundings and the places that we frequent in a different way, giving time for the contemplation and using our senses to reach diverse conclusions about what is a home.
