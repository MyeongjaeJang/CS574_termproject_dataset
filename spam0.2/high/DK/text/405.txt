Wolfenstein II playable on Nintendo Switch in two weeks' time Bethesda shows off "2 down 7 to go" fancy custom console. Text: David Caballero Published on the 23rd of Mar 2018 at 09 
Even though it doesn't have an official launch date yet, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus will be publicly playable for the first time very soon. As confirmed by the publisher, Bethesda will have the game at its Gameplay Day on April 7 at PAX East, in Boston. 
The company has teased its presence with a tweet from the official Wolfenstein account, at the same time announcing they'll be giving away a very exclusive black and yellow Nintendo Switch, a custom design shown in the picture below. 
The console will be granted "both to an in-person attendee and viewers watching online", and it's a "Customized Nintendo Switch inspired by the flight jacket worn by BJ Blazkowicz in Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus", including the motto "2 down 7 to go" (which, apparently, refers to how many lives a cat has). 
As revealed by Machine Games to Gamereactor , the port of the game to Nintendo's console is being handled by Panic Button, who already did a decent job on Doom . Given it's playable already, it looks like the release date is nigh (and thus its first trailer might well go live before PAX). Related texts
