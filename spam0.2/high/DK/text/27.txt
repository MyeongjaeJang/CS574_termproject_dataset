The multinational software-as-a-service company Siteimprove has been named ‘2018 Transatlantic Company of the Year’ by the American Chamber of Commerce in Denmark. 
The AmCham jury lauded Siteimprove for its impressive growth in the US over the past three years, which has seen the company increase its revenue in the US market from 8.1 to 28 million US dollars and raise its number of employees by close to 300 percent. 
“Siteimprove’s US activities are in rapid growth in a complex software market – and are also the company’s fastest-growing business compared to the rest of the world,” said Jørgen Bardenfleth, the spokesperson and chairman of the AmCham jury. 
“The fact that their US business makes up 61 percent of the company’s combined activities show that Siteimprove is fully committed to the US.”
