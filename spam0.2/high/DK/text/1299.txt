Patong Bangla Road Nightlife â€“ Phuket 2016 â€“ VLOG 108 
A video of a night out at Bangla Road, Patong. This is the first of 2 parts from another night out and the footage from this video ends around midnight. 
Some of the parts included in this vid are: 
0:02 Bangla Road start 
0:17 3 Ladyboys dancing & some tips on how to spot them. Also, lookout for their body language being much more forward than ladies and excessive touching of hair / checking their makeup. 
0:35 Bars of Bangla Road 
1:04 Big bootie spotted 
1:22 Outside the Tiger complex with some notable bars 
3:53 Upstair Agogo Stripclub 
4:45 Having an 80 baht beer opposite Lion Live Music bar 
6:48 Soi Toilet with lots of new places to eat. You can now tell your friends you enjoyed the seafood at the â€štoilet alleyâ€˜ ðŸ™‚ 
7:42 Pum Pui Bar. One of my favourite spots for eye candy. The girls are prettier than average here and naturally this translates into higher barfine and short time prices. There is a ping pong show bar at the back of Pum Pui, that accounts for random tourists walking through some of the shots. 
10:57 Soi Seadragon gogo bar area. Including the sounds of Thai promo guys beating their advertisement boards. If they had women to tempt you into the bars (similar to Pattaya / Bangkok) I think this place would see a lot more footfall. 
12:41 Bangla Road, including security from a bar shining dangerous laser pens at passers by (I saw a lot of this on Bangla Road). A street performer making a touristâ€™s glasses â€šlevitate.â€˜ 
13:25 Crazy Horse Circus bar including a nice looking pole dancer. 
16:03 Outro from a previous visit to the Crazy Horse Circus bar ðŸ™‚ 
Bangla Road is the centre of nightlife for the popular holiday destination of Phuket. 
Itâ€™s a great place for bar hopping, with many regular bars, beer bars, gogo bars, live music bars and nightclubs all on one street!
