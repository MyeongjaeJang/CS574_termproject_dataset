Work has already begun on Rian Johnson's Star Wars trilogy It's been going for a while now. Text: Magnus Groth-Andersen Published on the 24th of Mar 2018 at 11 
While Star Wars: The Last Jedi was a controversial chapter in the saga, Disney obviously felt like the movie was in such good hands that they decided to give the green light to Johnson developing a whole new Star Wars trilogy. This new trilogy will be completely removed from the rest of the series framework, and surprisingly, work has already begun. 
Screen Rant reports that work on the new trilogy in fact started before the premiere of The Last Jedi back in December, but since then there's been no word on its development. In a new interview with Empire however, producing partner Ram Bergman has once again stated that they've started working on the project. 
"We've started. Slowly, slowly, but we've started. Hopefully soon we're going to get busier," were the exact words. It's currently unknown what the trilogy is going to be about either, so all we have to do now is wait. What are your hopes? You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now !
