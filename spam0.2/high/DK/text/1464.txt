Rise of Legions is a fast paced Castle Siege-style RTS that sees you sending out waves of auto-walking minions and using powerful spells to storm your opponents base and destroy their nexus. 
Rise of Legions pits players against each other in 1v1 and 2v2 online multiplayer or single player PvE challenges against powerful bosses. The aim of each match is to overpower your opponents forces and destroy their Nexus. You do this by strategically deploying units and by using powerful spells that can aid your troops which are fighting on the front line. 
There are three different Legions (factions) that you can play as at the moment (with more to come int he future), each with their own unique sets of units. As you progress you’ll collect units and spells to customize your deck with. You deploy your units from your base and they auto-walk towards your opponents base, attacking anything in their way. Choosing units that are strong against your opponents troops is key and clever use of spells can help turn the tide of battle too. 
It’s a great looking game that looks set to offer fast paced and streamlined RTS battles in a fun fantasy setting. Sign up now to start building your legion.
