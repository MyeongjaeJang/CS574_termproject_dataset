Celebrate all things Gursky with a set inspired by the artistâ€™s love of techno. ðŸŽµ ðŸŽ¶ 
Drawing from Gurskyâ€™s interest in â€˜the way that the world is constitutedâ€™, this special late-night event features a forward-thinking line-up of sound artists who share a similar fascination with atoms and the void. 
Hear JASSSâ€™s metallic field recordings, drone duo Giant Swan, and Pan Daijingâ€™s â€˜near asphyxiatingâ€™ interpretation of noise and techno. 
The trio of artists are among the most celebrated and progressive young musicians working in experimental electronics today, and make their debut at this Boiler Room event. 
Pan Daijing also debuts her original composition for the exhibition, with the soundtrack looped continuously at Hayward Gallery throughout the night.
