Bethesda showing "healthy number" of new projects at E3 We spoke with Pete Hines about what's coming from the publisher. Text: Sam Bishop   12 
At PAX East we had the chance to speak with Bethesda's Senior Vice President of Marketing Pete Hines about all things Bethesda, from Nintendo support to ongoing games, and right at the end we asked if we could get a tease for what's coming at E3, and boy did Hines deliver. 
"We have some surprises in store," he said. "We're gonna be talking about a healthy number of new games and new projects and... look, I'm really excited. We've been working on E3 for this year since September of last year. I'm already seven, eight months into working on E3, but I really like how it's coming along. I think there's gonna be something in there for everyone regardless of what you play on or what kind of games you're into, and my biggest hope always is that we deliver on the promise of E3." 
"I think we promised a lot of stuff last year, we shipped every one of those games and they were all really good quality - I think we had the highest Metacritic rating of any publisher in 2017 - and that's our goal again this year, is to not only talk about new stuff but also deliver on those promises and give people the kind of games that they really want and expect from Bethesda." 
If we weren't already hyped enough, now we really can't wait to see what's coming from Bethesda this summer at E3. What do you want to see? You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now ! Ã—
