Now that the dust has settled on A Way Out , Hazelight's intriguing and innovative co-op only action adventure game, the studio is already starting to work on its next project. We've no idea what it might be or when we might see it, but Fares wrote on Twitter : 
"Today is officially the start of the next game and I'm INCREDIBLY exited I love making videogames and can't wait to show it!" 
With both A Way Out and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons before it, Fares has shown that he has an eye for merging creative gameplay and story-driven adventures, and we're certainly looking forward to seeing his next project, whatever that may be. Related texts
