The hand-crafted sets of Wes Andersonâ€™s dystopian film Isle of Dogs giving you a chance to explore his vision of Japan in 20 years time. ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ ðŸŒ† 
Andersonâ€™s fictional city, Megasaki, along with its autocratic puppet mayor, Kobayashi, a man with a vendetta against dogs. In the stop-motion animation, Kobayashi exiles all canines to Trash Island â€“ on show in all its rubbish-laden glory â€“ where they form clans and fight for food. Meanwhile the mayorâ€™s 12-year-old nephew embarks on a mission to save his beloved dog Spot and turn around the fortunes of all his furry friends. 
17 original sets take over the ground floor of The Store. These meticulously crafted visions of Japanese culture are a model architecture-loverâ€™s dream â€“ the towering metropolis has been created in extraordinary detail, down to pot plants and the requisite red lanterns. Thereâ€™s even a wood-panelled bar, stocked with medically enhanced sake. Meanwhile, you can almost spell the festering rubbish on Trash Island. 
Food (Japanese Ramen) and drink will be available to purchase from the â€˜Noodle Barâ€™ from midday. Sake cocktails and bar snacks available during late night openings on Thursday/Friday.
