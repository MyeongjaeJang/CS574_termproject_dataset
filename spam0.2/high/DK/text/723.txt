Jurassic World Evo's Isla Sorna "bigger than Planet Coaster" Each island has its own vibe and challenges. Text: David Kers Published on the 29th of Mar 2018 at 14 
Earlier this month we visited Universal Studios to play Frontier Developments upcoming simulation game Jurassic World Evolution and during that time we also got a chance to talk to the development team behind the game. 
One of them was game director Michael Brookes who we asked about the Muertes Archipelago where you will build your park. Brookes reveals that the biggest playable island in the game, Isla Sorna, is "800,000 mÂ², which is slightly bigger than the entire Planet Coaster map". 
The different islands force you to change your strategy as they have their own challenges to overcome: 
"Each of the [five] islands has their own kind of mood and challenges associated with it. Then as you progress to other island you get all of these new challenges; one of them is really narrow and thin so you have to distribute or manage your resources through the island, or there can be violent weather." They "mixed up the visuals and the challenges of the islands". To which Fletcher added that for example "with the really small island you have to choose which dinosaurs to keep, because there is only so much you have space for." 
The full interview with Brookes will be posted soon, for now you can check out our hands-on preview of the game. Related texts
