Tales from the Sea of Thieves book sets sail The in-universe journal is available now. Text: Sam Bishop Published on the 25th of Mar 2018 at 13 
Rare and Microsoft's Sea of Thieves has just launched on PC and Xbox One, and if you just can't get enough swashbuckling action you may be interested to hear that Titan Books has released Tales from the Sea of Thieves, a book made in conjunction with Rare's game writers. 
The in-universe journal was also built using early beta feedback and adventures and is narrated by Captain Flameheart with input from the rest of his crew, showing the world of the game through their own eyes, including the different towns and islands. 
As you can see from the excerpts below, the entire presentation matches the theme of the game nicely, and what's more is that we have plenty of illustrations as well, so it's the perfect thing to read after you've finished your pirate adventures in-game. 
Make sure to catch our stream of the game below as well if you're interested. Is this a book you'll be picking up? Related texts
