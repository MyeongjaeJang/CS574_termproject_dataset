Volvo Cars has just confirmed that it will produce cars for the new car brand Lynk & Co in its Belgian plant in Ghent from late 2019. Lynk & Co was launched as a new volume brand by Geely, the owner of Volvo Cars, in 2015. By providing production capacity at its Ghent plant, Volvo Cars is backing the expansion of the new car brand in Europe and further diversifying its business. “We see a big potential for this new brand entering the European market and we are happy to give Lynk & Co the support of Volvo’s technological and industrial expertise,” said Håkan Samuelsson, president and CEO of Volvo Cars. Joint production will also have a positive effect on cost levels, employment and production volumes at the Ghent plant, while generating further economies of scale.
