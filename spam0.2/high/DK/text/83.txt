“The crazy thing is this last one. My parents just kinda found out online’. 
My Mom just wants me to get married, stay with one woman and have babies but I’m 27 years old.” 
Wizkid continued saying although he has 3 kids from 3 different women, he would love another child, this time a girl. 
“I’ve got three kids, three lovely boys that I love so much. I want a girl,” he said. 
On not being able to keep his life private he said; 
“I’m a private person. I like to keep my personal life out of the media as much as I can,” he said.
