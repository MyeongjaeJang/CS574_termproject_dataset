For more writing, creating, and mostly for my research about Bronze Age symbolism of a hjulkors. Cross in a circleâ€¦ LOL I promised myself that I will not do it, but now I am struggling, really. And I do not have sponsors I do not promote anyone because they paid me for it. If I like it, if I believe in it, if it is truth, I write about it, that is all. Nobody pays me for it.
