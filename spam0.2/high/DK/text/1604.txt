Mega Man X Legacy Collection to be released in July Celebrate summer with some nostalgia. Text: Jonas MÃ¤ki   10 
Late last year Capcom revealed that the eight numbered Mega Man X games would be re-released for PC, PlayStation 4, Switch and Xbox One, but what they didn't tell us was whether the games would be sold digitally as individual titles or as part of a bigger collection. It turns out it was neither, as the eight games will be split up into two collections. 
Mega Man X Legacy Collection has, as you might have figured, Mega Man X 1-4 while Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2 has the last four games. Both of these will be released on July 24 and are crammed with extras like museum features, music, filters for the graphics (why anyone would choose to use anything else than the beautiful regular pixels is beyond us though), and something called the X Challenge where you have to fight two bosses at once. 
A brand new trailer can be found below that shows plenty of this stuff. Which collection will you be getting? Related texts
