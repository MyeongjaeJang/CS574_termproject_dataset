Spyro: Reignited Trilogy listed on Amazon Mexico Is Activision announcing something soon? Text: Fabrizia Malgieri Published on the 5th of Apr 2018 at 09 
While nostalgic fans appear to be rather impatient for what appears to be an upcoming announcement of a remastered collection dedicated to Spyro the Dragon, Amazon Mexico has seemingly jumped the gun and has listed Spyro: Reignited Trilogy last night, revealing not only what could be the official title for the collection, but also its boxart and launch date. 
If this information is reliable, the game is expected on September 21 exclusively on PlayStation 4. At the time of writing we've had no confirmation from Activision and Sony, but given the movement we've seen on social media in the last few hours, it's very likely that something will be announced in the very near future. Stay tuned and we'll update you if and when Reignited Trilogy is made official.
