On our livestream today we try out Far Cry 5 Arcade We take Ubisoft's shooter in a slightly different direction. Text: Sam Bishop   11 
We've talked about Ubisoft's Far Cry 5 a lot in recent weeks, whether that be in our review or livestreams, but now it's time to try something slightly different, this being the Arcade mode that you may have seen promoted on your travels through Hope County. 
This isn't quite the same as the base game, as Arcade is a whole new kettle of fish. Here community creations are key to making new experiences that can be played alone or online, and there's no shortage of possibilities. 
DÃ³ri will be taking Arcade out for a spin on our livestream today, in fact, which you can watch on our live page from 15:00 BST (16:00 CEST) for a couple of hours. Have you had a chance to try Arcade yet though? Related texts
