Mistakes… 
Definitions. 
Or what if, what if all we do are just paths we try? What if nothing is a mistake, only a learning curve? What if… we could come back, and in fact still be choosing the same ways? Okay, I know what Einstein said about mistakes, but still. 
What if? 
Because the truth is one… we all live and die, and only the end tells us all, and in fact leave us in total disbelieve. I mean really. Maybe the most important thing is not what we forget but what we do not want to remember? Or maybe… too many questions, too many, so what to put them for? Why we do not just live. 
Without all this judging? 
Without guilt? 
Nope, I am not saying about loosing our conscience, but about empathy ad joy, which we are loosing so quickly. Whipping ourselves for every mistake…
