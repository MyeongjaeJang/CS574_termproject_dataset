Crytek introduces new royalty-based system for CryEngine As well as a whole host of improvements and enhancements. Text: Magnus Groth-Andersen Published on the 21st of Mar 2018 at 12 
CryEngine is, despite a drop-off in popularity over the past few years, still among the most used and recognisable graphic engines in the business, and now, in order to funnel in new talent to use it to make their games, Crytek is making some alterations to its business model, meaning new studios can get their hands on it for less. 
Crytek has revealed a royalty-based system as part of this, which means that a 5% royalty fee will incur after the project created with CryEngine V exceeds $5,000 USD in revenue. Additionally, a range of technical changes, improvements, and enhancements have also been added. 
CryEngine's Product Manager Collin Bishop said: "CryEngine 5.5 represents our focus on usability and onboarding with the editor toolset and engine codebase. The arrival of the CryEngine Certification Program, revamped documentation, and new editor source code allows for developers worldwide to work uninhibited with the CryEngine toolset, within a model that provides a price-point for all sizes of teams. We have also created a new onboarding project named Flappy Boid that quickly teaches developers how to create a full game in CryEngine from scratch, with no prior engine knowledge, as part of our drive to open up the power of CryEngine to all."
