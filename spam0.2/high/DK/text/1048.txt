A busy job, taking up sports and aspiring to a healthy lifestyle: sometimes it is best if you not only own a business, but are also exactly the type of person that your company caters to. Take Sylvia van Alphen for example, who founded juiz~s by rebranding an existing line of cold-pressed juices. She explains: “I was doing yoga in The Hague and the owners of the school had their own brand of juice. They asked me to do the sales and before long asked me if I wanted to take over. I took that leap of faith; quit my job, rebranded the product to juiz~s and retrained myself to become a fully licensed nutrition consultant.” Advertisement
