Ace Combat is a franchise with a long and fruitful history spanning many titles, and now, according to a Japanese job listing Gematsu has just found online, Bandai Namco could be working on three remastered games from the series. 
The games in question are the well-received PS2 classics Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies (which was renamed to Ace Combat 04: Distant Thunder in Europe); Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War (launched as Ace Combat 5: Squadron Leader in Europe); and Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War, and the agency that posted the job listing is searching for a person who can lead a small team and answer in-depth questions about the various games' mechanics.
