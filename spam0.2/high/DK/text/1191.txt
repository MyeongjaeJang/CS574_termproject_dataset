We've got a GRTV double bill for you today, as the team is in Boston for this year's PAX East. Join Bengt and Daniel as they give us the lowdown on everything they've seen on the opening day of the event. And if that's not enough for you, the second video is a tour of the show floor, which should give you a good idea as to the scale of this popular annual event. You must be logged in to comment.
