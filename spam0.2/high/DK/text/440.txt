Switch sells more than other consoles during first year in US It's even more popular than the PS2 and Wii. Text: Magnus Groth-Andersen   10 
The fact that the Switch is extremely popular is a known fact at this point, and we've already published a number of stories about the console hitting one impressive milestone after another. Now we have another one, which is an achievement that confirms just how popular the Switch has become. 
According to new data obtained by the NPD group, the Nintendo Switch has managed to outsell any console platform in US history during its first 12 months on the market. That means that the Switch has outsold the first 12 months of the PlayStation 2, the Wii, and all the other platforms that struck a chord with the wider public. 
It should be noted though, that handhelds are not included in the data, but if they were, the GameBoy Advance would be first. Still, it's a landmark achievement, but is it one that you were expecting? You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now ! Ã—
