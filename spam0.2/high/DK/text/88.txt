Photographer Richard Ramirez Jr. captures an earnest portrait of familiarity in this Sch√∂n! online editorial. Fashion by Jesse Lynn Dell sees models Judy , Braina and Gabriette clad in vintage pieces, colourfully and sensually displaying lace, leather and checkered eleganza . Structured jet black hair by Heather Rae using R+Co becomes the ultimate nexus to the scene; whilst makeup by Esther Foster powerfully complements the garments.
