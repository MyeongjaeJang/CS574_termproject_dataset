Nier: Automata fans rejoice, as Viz Media will be bringing the two novels based on Nier: Automata to the west - Long Story Short and Short Story Long. The announcement came via the publisher's own Twitter , pointing to a October release for the first novel, and a 2019 release for the second one. Both novels are available in Japan, and expand upon the complex world and plot presented by Platinum Games' bizarre title. 
No price has been revealed, but expect two different prices, as the Japanese version of a Long Story Short has 130 pages, while A Short Story Long has 318 pages. Expect further details in the coming months, but for now it's good news that we'll be getting them at all.
