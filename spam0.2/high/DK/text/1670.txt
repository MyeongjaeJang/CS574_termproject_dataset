Yacht Club Games released their retro-styled action platformer Shovel Knight back in 2014, which quickly became a success, selling a million copies in just a few months. Since then the game has been updated and expanded many times, and now the developer has announced that a new milestone has been reached. 
Shovel Knight has now sold more than two million copies across all platforms, and to celebrate this occasion Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove now has a 20% discount on Switch, Wii U, 3DS, PS4, PS3, PS Vita, Xbox One, Steam, GOG, and Humble Store. 
Not surprisingly, the Nintendo Switch has been a good platform for Shovel Knight, as it has with a lot of other indies. In fact, during last year the game sold 370,000 copies on the Switch, which makes it the third most popular platform for Shovel Knight, with only PC and 3DS in front of it.
