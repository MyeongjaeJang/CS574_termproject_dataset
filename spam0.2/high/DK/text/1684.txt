Nobunaga's Ambition: Taishi comes to the West in June And it looks a lot like Nioh. Text: Markus Hirsil√§   16 
One of the most interesting eras of Japanese history is the so-called Sengoku period (circa 1467 - circa 1603). This is where most of the iconic samurai, ninja, Shogun, and other such things come from, and in fact this era is still relevant in video games, as last year we got a Souls-like action game Nioh, and now the next standalone entry in the Grand Strategy Series called Nobunaga's Ambition: Taishi is coming to the West. 
Koei Tecmo has announced that Nobunaga's Ambition: Taishi will be released on PC and PS4 on June 8. It will let players "experience the moments that lead up to the fracture of Japan - from the establishment of clans to the emergence of the first Shogunate", but what's new is the Resolve System, "where each officer has their own set of aspirations that will depict how they will act in a given situation and gameplay will change accordingly, with new tactics needed to accommodate opposing or similar viewpoints. With the Resolve System officers will be showcase a more human and personal feel, providing players a deeper insight into the historical simulation". 
There aren't that many strategy games available for consoles, so let's see if Nobunaga's Ambition: Taishi is worth our time. For now though you can watch a new trailer below, where you should also take a mental note that cutscenes look a lot like Nioh.
