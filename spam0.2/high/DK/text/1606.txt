Check out the latest God of War trailer We're creeping closer and closer to release. Text: Jonas MÃ¤ki   09 
We are now nine days away from the release of God of War, and there's still plenty of stuff Santa Monica Studios hasn't shown for the game, including things like the customisation for example, which actually forms quite a big part of the experience, as we know from getting our hands on the game. 
Have no fear though, because this is now being shown in a new trailer called Fight Your Way, which you can watch below. As you can see, we're not only talking visual additions, but also those that affect the gameplay, so it's worth paying attention to.
