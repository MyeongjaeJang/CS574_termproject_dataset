Futuristic combat racer Grip (or GRIP), which has been available in Steam Early Access since two years, has found a publisher in Wired Production and a full release is set for this year on PC as well as consoles (PS4, Switch, and Xbox One). Via the press release, game director Chris Mallinson, had this to say on the announcement: 
"We're very excited to finally announce our partnership with Wired Productions today. " Grip began as a passion project paying tribute to the great Rollcage games and racers of a past era, but it's now truly transformed into a fully-fledged, futuristic combat racer fit for this generation. We're extremely proud of the game and can't wait to unleash it later this year on all platforms. Combat racing is back, baby."
