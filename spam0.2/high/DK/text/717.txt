Sea of Thieves hackers emerge Who would've thought pirates could be so dishonourable? Text: Sam Bishop Published on the 29th of Mar 2018 at 16 
Microsoft and Rare's Sea of Thieves has only just been released, but there are already some players looking to spoil the fun for everybody by hacking the game, as reported by Windows Central , including one particular hack that allows auto-aiming on heads, locating chests through walls, and all manner of other things that aren't cool. 
Because of cross-play this also means Xbox players have been affected by the hackers, something that console players haven't been that used to in the past. It doesn't seem like it's a huge problem with tons of players doing this though, which is a good thing, and those who have cheated have been banned by Xbox Live.
