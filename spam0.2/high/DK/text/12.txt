Check out these tiny Nintendo Switch cases No unnecessary plastic was used making these boxes. Text: Jonas Mäki Published on the 18th of Mar 2018 at 15 
As you might know, the games for Nintendo Switch are very small. Tiny like memory cards. And we already know they taste awful, but that's another story. Instead, we want to tell you about some truly awesome game cases created by a gentleman called Mahir Sümer . They're roughly the same size as the actual cartridge and look really cute. We assume this is the perfect way to lose track of your games every now and then - but when it happens, at least your doing it with style. Glorious, isn't it? You must be logged in to comment.
