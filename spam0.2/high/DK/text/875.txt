Held at Century Club, the night will play host to a fiesta of Panama proportions, with the hot, hot heat of Cuba celebrated. It’s the sensual country of danzón, so bring out your best Latin moves to a night of music by DJ duo Rumpsteppers. On the rooftop – that boasts a unique vantage point in London, we might add – dance to the rhythms of Party on Down, with all those Salsa, Cha Cha Cha and Tango moves you have hidden away and are dying to put to the test. 
On the refreshments front, it’s at the Cuban cocktail lounge that the flavours will be flowing, with colourful options of Cuba Libre. Served with a tangy selection of canapés, your senses will be alive with the spice of Cuba’s finest cultural output.
