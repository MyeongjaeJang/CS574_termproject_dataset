Acc: Hilleberg Allak tent 
weather day off 
How nice that is…to wake early at 5.30 am, do the bathroom job, and crawl back into the warm bag to turn around again and to give the sore body a day of rest… It is 2m+ swell today, with strong north winds especially in the afternoon up to 25-30 knots. We might have been able to paddle from 7-11 am, but also skipped this to be reasonable. I did a lot of office work in the morning, to manage the kayak shipping north and such. Another long hike to the stunning cliff formations of Cape San Sebastian was the pleasure job of the day. Not much else to report! We might paddle tomorrow early from 6.45 to maybe 11-12 am, Whalehead or earlier – or even Brookings if it feels good. There are a few dead calm days coming for the weekend!
