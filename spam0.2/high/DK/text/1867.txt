Sega unveils the Mega Drive Mini in Japan Thirty years after its initial launch, Sega's iconic console is making a comeback. Text: Mike Holmes Published on the 14th of Apr 2018 at 15 
In the wee small hours of this morning during Sega Fes 2018, the publisher announced its return to the console space, with the House of Sonic set to once again go toe-to-toe with Nintendo, at least in terms of pint-sized consoles. That's right, there's a Mega Drive Mini in the works. 
The new retro console, which you can see in the trailer below, is set to land at some point in 2018, thirty years after its initial emergence in Japan back in 1988. We don't know exactly when and where it'll launch, we don't know how much it's going to cost and who's going to produce it, and we don't know which games will make an appearance, nor how many. Simply put, we don't know much. 
What we do know is that Sega has a history of reworking its classic games and re-releasing them, so looking at the collections they've put out over the years will likely give us a good indication of what we should expect. We could throw around names like Streets of Rage and Echo the Dolphin, but ultimately we'd be speculating, although we think its safe to say there'll be a certain blue hedgehog making an appearance or two. 
It's also worth noting that over the last few years we've seen third-party licensed mini Mega Drive / Genesis consoles, and it's not yet clear whether this is another example of the publisher's past collaboration with manufacturer AtGames, or something new and more in-house. We've asked Sega to clarify that and to confirm whether or not the Mini Mega Drive will make it to market in the west, and we'll update you here on Gamereactor as soon as we know more.
