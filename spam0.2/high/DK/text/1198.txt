As a sales agency between factories, fashion brands and retailers, ARTFASHION is one of Antwerp’s newest ventures for streamlining the journey of clothing, from being made from scratch to being made available in shops. Spearheaded by Belgians Charlotte Nollet and Gunther Levi, ARTFASHION has quickly made a name for itself as a trustworthy matchmaker, seeking out the most compatible fashion brands for women’s boutiques in particular. Working as a gymnastics teacher, an account manager and as a representative for a fashion brand, there was something nagging at Charlotte Nollet: “My parents and husband are independent entrepreneurs and after the birth of our first child, it was a ‘now or never’ moment.” Advertisement
