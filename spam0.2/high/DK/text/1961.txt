Donkey Kong champion reacts to controversy ''Everything was done professionally, according to the rules.'' Text: David Kers Published on the 16th of Apr 2018 at 08 
Last week we reported that all of the high scores posted by Billy Mitchell , the former Donkey Kong and Pac-Man champion, have been removed by Twin Galaxies. 
According to Twin Galaxies, which oversees high scores for a number of classic arcade games, Mitchell used emulated gameplay and passed it off as his own attempt to play on the original Donkey Kong arcade cabinet. 
Mitchell has now reacted to the controversy in a video, which can be viewed here . Mitchell unsurprisingly says he did everything by the rules and stated that "everything will be made available to you, nothing will be withheld'. 
Twin Galaxies has not responded to Mitchell's message, but seeing as how records are at stake we imagine this story is far from finished. Related texts
