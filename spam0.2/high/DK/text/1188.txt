“99% of my brain is other people’s lyrics,” says Ängie , citing Lana Del Rey , Lou Reed and Swedish cloud rapper Yung Lean as a few of her favourites. “I grew up in a small town outside Stockholm. It’s very beautiful but has a lot of stupid people” she begins. It’s unsurprising that a creative outsider like Ängie felt unsettled. In a culture that values lagom , meaning moderation, and jantelagen , meaning we’re all the same, Ängie ’s bold and rebellious image is unashamedly anti- jante . “It [was] hard because people tell you what you can and can’t do all the time and everyone knows every little thing about you. You have to have a great mind to make it out of there” she reveals. “I think it started with one thought — we’re all gonna die so why not try?” Ängie ’s plunge into the unknown paid off, after posting music to Soundcloud ignited her music career. hoodie.

“I don’t think I’ve had my breakthrough yet,” she claims. Although not a household name, her frank and explicit lyrics often spark enough controversy to make her a tabloid target. In a world where women get slandered for singing the same lyrics male artists and rappers have freely written about for decades, Ängie expresses her irritation. “Of course it’s frustrating. It’s silly as fuck.” When it comes to how society treats female sexuality in 2018, she feels there’s still a long way to go.“Sometimes I believe it’s not ever going to get better,” she says. blazer.
