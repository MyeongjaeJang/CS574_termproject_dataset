Level-5 already working on a 'modern day' game Don't expect to see it anytime soon though. Text: Stefan Briesenick Published on the 26th of Mar 2018 at 12 
Developer Level-5 has made some impressive fantasy RPGs over the last couple of years (including the fantastic Ni no Kuni games), helping to strengthen the studio's reputation, although much earlier in the company's history they were working with Microsoft on an eventually-cancelled MMORPG called True Fantasy Live Online for the Xbox, which could apparently be connected to their next game. 
In an interview with 4Gamer (as translated by Gematsu ) Akihiro Hino, president and CEO of Level-5, confirmed a "modern day" setting for this upcoming title, which seemingly has veins of an MMORPG. 
"We do have an idea," he explained. "I'm not sure if we can call it an MMORPG or not, but were plan to make a big title on the same scale as one. [...] By the way, the game we're preparing won't be fantasy but rather 'modern day." 
Because 2018 is the 20th anniversary for the studio, they plan to announce this project within the year, so don't expect to see it released anytime soon. Would you like to see a modern title from Level-5 though? You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now ! Ã—
