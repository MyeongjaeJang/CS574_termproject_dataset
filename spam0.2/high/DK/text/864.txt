Crossout's April fools event detailed Your most imaginative and creative vehicles will now pack a real punch. Text: Bengt Lemne Published on the 1st of Apr 2018 at 07 
Gaijin Entertainment are known to bring in some rather interesting playable April fools jokes in War Thunder , and their latest offering Crossout is no exception when it comes to this. Currently and running until April 2 there's a special Brawl where you'll spawn in one of the most creative creations the community has come up with (a fire-breathing dragon and a knight are among the examples). These will now not just be for show but have been equipped with powerful weapons. 
Additionally, a major overhaul of PvE has been ushered in, introducing 8 multi-stage raids that tie missions together. Crossout April fools images. Pictures from the new raids in Crossout . Related texts
