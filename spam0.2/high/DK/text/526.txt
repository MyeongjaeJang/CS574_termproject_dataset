Oddworld: Abe's Origins funded in 48 hours The special edition is coming our way next year. Text: David Caballero Published on the 26th of Mar 2018 at 10 
Only 48 hours after its activation, the Kickstarter campaign for Oddworld: Abe's Origins has already surpassed its initial target of £45,000, which means the special edition - including a brand new volume and Oddworld Inhabitants' classics - will become a reality (even though they'll start shipping in April 2019). 
The hardcover book includes never-before-seen concepts recently collected by co-founder Lorne Lanning , along with new interviews and other material. On the other hand, the games themselves will come in the form of boxed DVD release on PC of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee and Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus. 
The video below gives us a taste of the project, and just so you know, the only way to buy this limited edition is via the Kickstarter link, and apparently only before April 21 this year.
