Red Dead Redemption gets Xbox One X support Alongside five other games. Text: Jonas MÃ¤ki   09 
Microsoft held an Inside Xbox show late last night, having promised big news regarding backwards compatibility, and it didn't disappoint. We found out during the show that six Xbox 360 games will be getting the full Xbox One X treatment with better colours and added 4K resolution, including the excellent Red Dead Redemption. 
Let's not forget the other games included though, which are Gears of War 2; Sonic Generations; Star Wars: The Force Unleashed; Darksiders; and Portal 2, so even if you aren't into western gunslinging there may be something of interest for you. 
What's more is that you don't even have to wait for this, as the updates have already been released. We haven't had the chance to try this out for ourselves yet, but ResetEra user Gossi has posted a screenshot of Red Dead Redemption in 4K that you can find below. 
Is Red Dead Redemption your game of choice out of these lot? Related texts
