Now we know when EA will run their E3 press conference It's not as late for us in Europe as you might expect. Text: Jonas Mäki Published on the 11th of Apr 2018 at 15 
Earlier this year, EA revealed that they would have an EA Play event on June 9, which lasts for two days, and now they have confirmed when we can look forward to their press conference, which will take place on June 9 at 19:00 BST (20:00 CEST). That's a very good time for us in Europe, unlike several others who run their press conferences in the middle of the night. 
We assume we'll get to see more from their upcoming Star Wars projects as well as new information on Anthem, Battlefield V, FIFA 19, and other games. Do you have anything in particular you hope they will show? You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now ! ×
