Introducing Dolmen - Lovecraftian horror and sci-fi Brazilian action-RPG will launch on Kickstarter next month. Text: Bengt Lemne Published on the 22nd of Mar 2018 at 11 
Brazil is really starting to come into its own in terms of gameplay and the latest Brazilian game to catch our eye is Dolmen, and action-RPG with sci-fi and Lovecraftian horror themes. The game takes place on a planet called Revion Prime, where a massive massacre has taken place, the victims now suspended in orbit in a mass grave of sorts. The player is a lone human astronaut who somehow got transported through time and space and now has to fend for himself in this hostile environment. 
The plan for Dolmen is to launch a Kickstarter in a couple of weeks and for an Early Access launch later this year (September), this will, of course, be followed by a full release and console ports (PS4, Xbox One) are tentatively expected in 2019-2020. Related texts
