9 Monkeys of Shaolin is called "a true rebirth of the iconic brawler genre in vein of old-school video games" on the Steam page , and sees you fill the shoes of Chinese fisherman Wei Cheng to avenge the deaths of your loved ones, using martial arts to beat your way through the enemies you come across. It's said to be inspired by the great Kung Fu films of the 1970s as well, which should give you some idea of tone too.
