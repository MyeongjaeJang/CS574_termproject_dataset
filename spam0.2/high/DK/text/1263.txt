Sam Fisher is heading to the Wildlands in Bolivia More information coming on Monday. Text: Mike Holmes Published on the 7th of Apr 2018 at 10 
Is Sam Fisher about to make his return as an addition to Ghost Recon: Wildlands? That's certainly what it looks like as the official Ghost Recon Twitter just posted the following message along with a short teaser vid where we can clearly hear the voice of actor Michael Ironside, who confirms that he's on his way to Bolivia: 
"When duty calls, he answers. Stay tuned for a full briefing on April 9," says the text accompanying the teaser trailer. 
This tease comes hot on the heels of a recent update from Ubisoft with regards to a second year of Wildlands DLC , and an appearance from Splinter Cell's Sam Fisher would certainly be an excellent way of building on a strong first year for the game. 
We've heard whispers that there might be a new Splinter Cell game in the works, so could an appearance in Ghost Recon be some sort of prelude to a new core game in that series? While we're unlikely to find out more about that any time soon, we'll at least discover what's coming to Wildlands on Monday. Stay tuned to Gamereactor for that. Related texts
