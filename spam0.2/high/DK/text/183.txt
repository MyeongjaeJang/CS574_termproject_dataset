PlayStation Vita discontinued in Spain Hasta la Vita. Text: Magnus Groth-Andersen Published on the 21st of Mar 2018 at 13 
Yes, we've arrived at what's possibly the saddest news of the day. While PlayStation Vita has a cult following, it failed to strike a chord with a general, broad audience, and with lack of support from Sony's side, it all went downhill pretty quickly. While the system is still being manufactured in many territories, it looks like the beginning of the end, as PlayStation in Spain recently confirmed in a reply on Twitter that the system has been officially discontinued in the country. 
It's currently unknown whether many other territories will follow very soon, or whether they'll be dragging out the Vita's demise a bit more. Are you a fan of the Vita? You must be logged in to comment. If you are not yet a member - join now ! Ã—
