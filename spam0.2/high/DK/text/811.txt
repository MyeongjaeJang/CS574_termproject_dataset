Dist: 28,5 km Start: 07:20 End: 13:30 
The plan was to start at 6.45am, Josh was up early and packing happily in darkness. Good…but at the end, we were on the water at 7.20 am…still good enough for today. We paddled along a longish beach for the start, with some swell going and lightly breaking here and there. Nothing serious, but also nothing really exciting. The rather exciting thing was a light argument between the two of us how and what to write on my blog 🙂 Different perspectives…but all good. 
Once we arrived at Crook Point, the fun started…we stayed close to the coast, and threaded ourselves through literally a maze of huge rocks, about twenty arches and many other narrow gaps behind or between reefs, inviting as play spots…one of the higlights on the beginning was the huge Mack Arch a bit offshore on the outer reef. WOW! 
But all other arches gave us one “WOW” after the other! Most of them were easy going wide and high, but two of them looked firsthand in today’s swell and tide level undoable…but when I was sitting there and watched…the first “hairy” one was a meter low and meter narrow maybe 15 meter long tunnel hole, which looked from one side it would be filled fully up with the swell at the highest, and squeezed to the tunnel roof being in there is not the nicest outlook…but I checked from the other side, sat there and watched…and watched…and put my helmet on…and watched…and watched…and one strong paddle stroke, paddle held lengthwise, and I was through the low and narrow hole, without being squeezed to the ceiling…and without touching any wall…YAHOOOO!!!It was opening up in some wider and less scary tunnel. Josh watched the same, but had to handrail through…a bit too slow initially, but ok. 
The other scary one was a narrow diagonal tunnel, also looking un-doable at first, with the swell at the lowest having barely water enough wide enough for my kayak, and at the highest, the line was shifted to the side…same thing for me…watching, watching…watching…and through I was! 🙂 Same game for Josh, no problems…good guy! 
We kept on playing and enjoying the day, landed on a high-washed-up steepish beach besides a big waterfall, took many pictures…and kept on playing…the last three kilometers to Whales Head were unsheltered, and a bit lumpy and big in reflective waves…but it could be worse. A wonderful wide beach with quite a few tourists was waiting for us, but we found a private corner for our tents. Josh went swimming…in his dry suit! Whimp… 🙂 I stripped down for a chilly hair- and body wash in the river, but had to wear here with that handful of people around a swim suit not to get arrested for public indecency 🙂 
I spoke to Tony, a British guy, who was patiently washing some gold dust ot of the same river, but he admitted that there are better ways to get rich 🙂 Josh and I went for an about two hours long hike high up on Whale’s Head cliff, in search for some Indian Beach, but we couldn’t find that one…what we found was for the way back at least a bridge over the river to avoid wet feet! 
Josh and I will get a paddling partner for Sunday – Franca Cioria will be able to join in for a few days or even weeks, almost as planned! Wonderful! We will meet Franca in two days at Crescent City. Tomorrow we’ll aim for around Smith River, Saturday evening arriving at Crescent City! Then we’ll have three easy low wind and swell days, perfect to paddle along “The Lost Coast” to Trinidad. One more day to Eureka to visit Kokatat’s for a dry suit exchange, and probably two or three weather days off just there. Perfect planning…so far… 🙂
