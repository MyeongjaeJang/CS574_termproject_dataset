The official NPD numbers for February are in, and they reveal two major winners in the US market, those being the PlayStation 4 and Monster Hunter: World. First up, PlayStation 4 was the highest-selling console of the month, beating the Switch which topped the charts in January, although at the same time NPD analyst Mat Piscatella has revealed that he believes that Sony has lost its market domination, and there's going to be a lot more back and forth from now on. 
Secondly, Monster Hunter: World managed to keep new, substantial February releases like Kingdom Come: Deliverance and Bayonetta 2 from the top of the list, as you can see below in the top 20: 
1. Monster Hunter: World 2. Call of Duty: WWII 3. NBA 2K18 5. Grand Theft Auto V 6. Shadow of the Colossus 7. UFC 3
