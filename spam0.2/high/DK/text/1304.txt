Update: The Swedish Edition Of Shining in the Dark Posted: April 8, 2018, 12:14:13 
A week ago a Kickstarter was launched to get Shining in the Dark translated into Swedish. I'm happy to be able to annonce that after just a week we have already reached 50% of the needed amount. Thanks to everyone who has supported the Kickstarter. But I need more help. All in all we need 100,000 SEK (US$12,000) to do the book (we how have a bit more than half of that). But I'm aiming higher. I want us to collect twice that amont because then Vincent Chong who has done the original cover will do a new, unic cover for this edition. So, if you haven't already, head over to the Kickstarter and support if you can. This will be a beautiful edition and there will only be 666 copies made.
