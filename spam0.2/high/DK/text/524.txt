Today on GR Live we're tackling some Far Cry 5 Bengt will be tearing up Montana for two hours. Text: Sam Bishop Published on the 26th of Mar 2018 at 11 
Far Cry 5 has had a lot of buzz around it ever since its first reveal, and now it's here, so what better way to celebrate the release of Ubisoft's open-world shooter than by playing it for two hours on our livestream today, which is exactly what Bengt will be doing as soon as the clock hits 15:00 BST (16:00 CEST). 
Don't worry about story spoilers though, because all that's done and dusted in Bengt's game, so this will instead be about the world, the people you meet, the side missions, and basically everything scattered around Hope County. We might even run into a wolverine or two. 
If all this sounds just like a barrel of laughs, make sure you join us over on our live page , and don't forget to check out our review while you're at it. Related texts
