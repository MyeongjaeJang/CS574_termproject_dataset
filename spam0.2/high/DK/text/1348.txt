Stupid Stupid Games has just announced a publishing deal with Forever Entertainment which will see its game, NoReload Heroes, land on Nintendo Switch at some point during Q2 this year. The press release states the April 27 launch date on Steam PC, and confirms that SSG is looking to bring the game to PS4 and Xbox One too, although no dates were mentioned in that direction. 
If it's not on your radar, this four-player party shooter comes with local and online multiplayer, and it's built around on and off-screen social interaction. You can see it in action in the trailer below. Related texts
