During Microsoft's Inside Xbox show yesterday we got to see a new trailer from the upcoming co-op title Overkill's The Walking Dead. As you might have guessed, it's based on The Walking Dead series, and has you and up to three friends working together to survive in the post-apocalyptic Washington D.C., which seem to be even worse with walkers instead of politicians. 
In this new video, we get to meet the character Maya, and it really sets the mood for things to come. We'll let you watch the video down below to see what we mean. 
There's still no release date for the game, other than late 2018, but hopefully we'll get to see more during E3. Is this a zombie game you're excited to play? Related texts
