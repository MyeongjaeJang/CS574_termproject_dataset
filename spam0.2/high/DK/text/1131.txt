Something new is coming to Animal Crossing's official site There are a bunch of "under construction" placeholders. Text: Juan A. Fonseca Published on the 5th of Apr 2018 at 11 
Is Animal Crossing for Nintendo Switch happening so soon? Well, that's probably a bit of a stretch, but what is clear is that something is going on with Animal Crossing's official site, and with Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp for mobiles out in the wild already, fans are hoping that these interesting developments point to something significant on the horizon. 
The site's frontpage remains as usual, but a number of people on Twitter are pointing out several changes that have been made to the news page . It is indeed under construction and full of placeholder material. 
For example, a trailer for Zelda: Breath of the Wild is being used as a test video, whereas the text for the articles comes from Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis. A clue of things to come? 
Unless Animal Crossing is readying an (even more) philosophical change of tone, it looks like a complete overhaul of the site is on the way. Therefore, in terms of new content, two possibilities come to mind; either it could be a new place for Pocket Camp players to get upcoming news, or it's a news hub for the yet-to-be-announced Switch entry.
