This year Britain marks 100 years since a qualified group of women in the UK were granted the right to vote. Yet a century later, much work is still needed to include many voices in the fight for equality and enfranchisement. Join us this Friday Late as we take a look at contemporary practices of activism and how democracy exists today. Is it what we always thought it would be? Examine the changing faces of feminism and inclusion, and listen up as storytellers shed light on narratives that are too often left unaccounted. ðŸ‘­ ðŸ—³ 
The original contemporary late night event. Friday Late celebrates all aspects of contemporary visual culture and design in society, bringing audiences face-to-face with leading and emerging artists and designers through live performance, film, installation, debate, DJs and late-night exhibition openings.
