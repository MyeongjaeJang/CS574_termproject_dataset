Microsoft has revealed that Rare's Sea of Thieves has accumulated more than two million players since launching a week ago on March 20. On launch day alone one million players set sail in the pirate adventure. It's also the best-selling Microsoft Studios first-party title for Windows 10 and the fastest-selling first-party new IP of this generation on Xbox One (beating out Quantum Break ). 
Sea of Thieves was streamed by more than 100,000 players, which resulted in more than 10 million hours watched on Twitch and Mixer. Microsoft also saw half a million new Xbox Live friendships established since release and 400,000 players joined a Xbox Club. 
Sea of Thieves got its first update yesterday, which fixed some bugs. Microsoft also states that the team at Rare is listening to player feedback, which it will discuss in an upcoming developer update.
