The beginnings of Qarc read as something of a fairy tale. As the daughter of dairy farmers, Leonie van Zuilichem worked with cows from a young age. As a student, she studied business economics, but that did not make her happy. What did make her happy, however, was working months on end at dairy farms in Norway, Ireland and Denmark, a time she describes as ‘almost utopic’. Back home in Bladel, her parents’ farm had the space to do something new and Leonie came up with business plans. Thoughts were put into ideas for a theme park or a karting circuit, but the love of dairy never left Leonie. In 2012, Qarc was born. Advertisement
