Apple 
Apple has nearly doubled the size of its self-drive fleet since January. The tech company now has 45 autonomous vehicles registered with the California Department of Motor Vehicles, the second-largest fleet in the state ( pictured: Santa Monica, CA ). Only General Motors has a bigger fleet. 
Apple started its self-drive pilot in April last year when it received a permit to test three autonomous vehicles. That fleet had increased to 27 by January. 
Nearly doubling the size of its autonomous fleet in the space of just two months seems to indicate that Apple – as always very secretive about its self-drive project – is kicking its efforts in this area into higher gear. 
The company is also planning to expand its self-drive pilots to the neighbouring state of Arizona. 
However, it is as yet unclear how last Sunday's deadly accident, in which an Uber autonomous car killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, will influence self-drive pilot projects in that state. Uber itself has suspended all testing, and it is expected that regulators will ramp up restrictions.
