This spring, activate your senses and rescue your mind. As the weather warms up and blue skies return to the city, meander, marvel and move in art at Exchange Square in Broadgate. 📸💁‍♀️ 
At the heart of spring is our free, engaging and multi-sensory Sense Of Space art pop-up installation comprising four very different rooms designed to engage the senses and transport you from the hustle of the city. 
Featuring the joyous work of Mr Doodle, human-activated art, an ode to a Japanese blossom garden and a tranquil Zen room – this is set to be one of London’s most unmissable events. Surrounding the Sense Of Space pop-up is Supermundane’s iconic graphics welcoming visitors to Exchange Square.
