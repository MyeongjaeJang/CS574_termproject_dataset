Vehicle subscription, or private lease as it is known in Europe, is a growing domain as the notion of owning cars loses ground in favour of ‘mobility as a service’. There is a new player in the United States. Mobiliti, based in Detroit, has announced that it will work with dealers to provide a vehicle subscription option to consumers. It has also indicated that the service will begin in Austin, Texas in May, and then spread to other major US markets. 
As reported by Auto Remarketing, the company says that the service will include amenities like insurance, maintenance, warranty coverage and roadside assistance. There is no down payment, initiation fee or long-term commitment. 
Mobiliti co-founder and chief executive Chance Richie explains in a press release: “Our goal is to create a model that gives consumers the flexibility they want and provides dealers with a subscription model that captures the value they offer consumers in service and delivery. Our relationship with Ally, a national leader in auto finance, provides the flexibility we need to best serve consumers and dealers as we roll out this unique business”. 
The companies also indicate that they are looking at the possibility of Mobiliti being able to offer consumer-financing via Ally’s Clearlane platform, should the subscriber wish to buy or lease the car when the subscription ends.
