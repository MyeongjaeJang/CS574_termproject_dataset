It looks like players are about to party their way out of hell. You might remember developer Night School Studios because of Oxenfree , but now the studio is doing something different. It's called Afterparty , and you can see its debut trailer right here on Gamereactor. 
The game has you in Hell, and the only way out is to party hard and outdrink Satan himself. One of the voice actors is Janina Gavankar, who you might remember as Iden Versio in Star Wars Battlefront II . The game features 2D gameplay, dialogue options, and has you interacting with objects in the environment. 
Afterparty's expected release window is sometime during 2019. Check it out below. Related texts
