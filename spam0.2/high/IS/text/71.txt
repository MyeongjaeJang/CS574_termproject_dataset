Seismic activity in Öræfajökull still going strong "Plenty of reason to monitor the course of events carefully." mbl.is/RAX 
Seismic activity in Öræfajökull volcano continues. This month, fourteen earthquakes measuring over 1.2 have been detected. 
An uncertainty level was declared in October and has yet not been lifted. Seismic activity has increased steadily since autumn 2016 and in the past few months it's been stronger than since measurements began four decades ago. 
Geophysicist Páll Einarsson says in today's issue of Morgunblaðið that these earthquakes "are telling us that there's plenty of reason to monitor the course of events carefully." Bigger quake possibly on its way "We think it's likely that the seismis activity will die down and that this morning's quake was the largest, but there could be a larger one or one of a similar size that will arrive. We can't rule that out," says Hildur María Friðriksdóttir at the Iceland Met Office asked about this mornings earthquake just off Grímsey and the ensuing uncertainty level raised by the Civil Protection in Iceland. Largest earthquake so far in Grímsey An earthquake of a magnitude of 5.2 was detected at Grímsey island at around 7 this morning. The powerful quake was felt in many parts of North Iceland and the department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management has declared a level of incertitude in North Iceland. © 2018 Árvakur hf., Iceland — All Rights Reserved Zeitgeist The ban on circumcision in Iceland: Humanity or hipocrisy?
