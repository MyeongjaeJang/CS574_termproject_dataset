For the better part of two decades, Serena Williams has been not only a dominant tennis player but one of the most prominent athletes the world has ever seen. However, her reign over the sport took a brief pause for motherhood during her pregnancy and the Sept. 1, 2017, birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. The months that followed found Williams mostly out of the public eye (as much as possible for an athlete of her stature, anyway), and she later revealed she had battled a life-threatening pulmonary embolism after her daughter’s birth. 
Now that she’s returning to the game as a mother, fans can’t help but expect that she’ll have something to prove in the lead-up to her Grand Slam return at the French Open in May 2018 . In a rare personal look into Williams’ life, HBO is offering a glimpse behind the scenes in the tennis legend’s docuseries “Being Serena.” The series will look at “Williams’ pregnancy, the birth of her child, her new marriage, and her return to the court,” according to HBO . 
The five-part series will tackle not only her return to the game but also how she reconciles her position as a sports icon with her new roles as a mother and wife. She’s proven capable of conquering every obstacle in her path from a professional standpoint, but with the stakes shifting, the series will look at how she continues to progress and adapt while the whole world watches. 
“Being Serena” premieres May 2, 2018, on HBO, with each of the five parts airing on Wednesdays thereafter.
