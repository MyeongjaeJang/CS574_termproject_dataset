As celebrities and many more donated millions of dollars to a cause led by students like Emma Gonzalez and David Hogg, other students who don’t support ridiculous anti-gun legislation feel unrepresented and left behind by a media that refuses to give everyone a voice. 2018-03-28 18:02:05 UTC #2 
This of course should come as no surprise. I would say that this ‘march’ has been in the work for months… hell if the conspiracy theory holds and the school was little more than a false flag then Hogg was well rehearsed before anything happened that his school… 
Contrary to what’s been reported in many media accounts, the D.C. March for Our Lives crowd was not primarily made up of teenagers. Only about 10 percent of the participants were under 18. The average age of the adults in the crowd was just under 49 years old, which is older than participants at the other marches I’ve surveyed but similar to the age of the average participant at the Million Moms March in 2000, which was also about gun control. 
About one in four participants were at their first political rally. However, Fisher says, they were not even motivated by gun control: 
Even more interesting, the new protesters were less motivated by the issue of gun control. In fact, only 12 percent of the people who were new to protesting reported that they were motivated to join the march because of the gun-control issue, compared with 60 percent of the participants with experience protesting. 
Instead, new protesters reported being motivated by the issues of peace (56 percent) and Trump (42 percent), who has been a galvanizing force for many protests.
