Ever since the revelation was made that data from Facebook was misused during Trump’s 2016 election campaign, the company has faced some serious backlash. Billions of dollars’ worth of value from the company’s shares have been wiped off while most of its users are also deleting their account. 
A #DeleteFacebook movement has started and millions of people, including notable celebrities, have joined it and asked others to boycott the social networking site. 
The co-founder of WhatsApp, Brian Acton, has joined the #DeleteFacebook movement as he took to Twitter on Tuesday to say that “It is time. #DeleteFacebook.” 
Why his boycotting the social networking site is creating waves is because WhatsAppa is owned by Facebook. The company was acquired by Facebook for $19 billion in 2014. It appears that Acton was not made to remove the tweet as it’s still on the website. 
The California-based social media giant came under fire after it was revealed that a firm working for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign harvested and misused data on 50 million users. The situation was magnified when Facebook suspended the account of Cambridge Analytica, which is a British firm hired by Trump’s 2016 campaign. 
The incident has scared investors leading to a downfall in the company’s share value by more than 9% over the last two days alone. 
Meanwhile the CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg and the COO Sheryl Sandberg have also remained mum on the issue, inviting more criticism from all quarters. SHARE
