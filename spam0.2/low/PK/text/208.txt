Srinagar, March 22 (KMS): In occupied Kashmir, the Chairman of All Parties Hurriyat Conference, Syed Ali Gilani, has said that India added black and barbarous chapter to the history by denying the inalienable right of self-determination to the people of Jammu and Kashmir. 
Syed Ali Gilani in a statement issued in Srinagar said that draconian laws, Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) and Public Safety Act (PSA) were the offshoots of the unresolved Kashmir dispute. He said this while reacting to the statement of Indian Minister, Hansraj Gangaram Ahir, wherein he stated that New Delhi had no plans to withdraw AFSPA in occupied Kashmir.
