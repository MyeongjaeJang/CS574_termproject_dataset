Fugitive Rao Anwar arrested from SC By 0 119 
ISLAMABAD: Former Malir SSP Rao Anwar who is accused of killing Naqeebullah Mehsood in an alleged fake encounter was arrested from outside the Supreme Court after he appeared before the apex court. A bench headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar has constituted a five-member committee comprising police officials and headed by Aftab Pathan. 
The chief justice asked him as to why he failed to trust the court and instead wrote letters which didn’t create good impression. The court said Sindh Police would be responsible for the security of the former Malir SSP. The officer who arrived in a white car wearing a mask appeared confident, according to reporters. He appeared before the court two months after extra judicial murder of Naqeebullah Mehsood, a youth from South Waziristan. Mehsood was killed in January in an encounter led by Rao Anwar, sparking outrage across the country. The Supreme Court took notice of the incident after authorities failed to arrest him. Aftab Pathan, the head of the JIT probing the Naqeebullah murder case, said that investigations against Rao Anwar will begin right away.“Investigations will be carried out based on the FIR,” he said while talking to Samaa after the Supreme Court ordered to arrest Rao Anwar from the courtroom. Until allegations are proven against him, Rao Anwar is an accused, not a criminal, said Sindh IG Allah Dino Khawaja shortly after the former Malir SSP’s arrest Haji Khan Muhammad, the father of Naqeebullah Mehsud thanked Supreme Court and hoped that it would give him justice in the case of his son’s extrajudicial murder. “20 million people of Pakistan stood by us for the cause,” Naqeeb’s father said while standing outside the premises of the apex court after the court ordered to arrest Rao Anwar from the courtroom.
