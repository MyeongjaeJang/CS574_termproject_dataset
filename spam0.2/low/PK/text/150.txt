An anti-terrorim court in Quetta, awarded death sentence to a person who had raped and killed a seven-year-old girl by the name of Sehar Batool in 2014. 
In addition to the death sentence, the court ordered the suspect, identified as Junaid Shehzad, to pay a fine of Rs200,000 to the victim’s family. 
Heaving a sigh of relief, Sehar’s family showed satisfaction over the court’s verdict and termed it as “justice served”. 
“Though our little daughter Sehar Batool has left us, but today justice has been provided to her and we really appreciate the media’s role in raising our voice against the brutality committed against our child,” Sehar’s father Ghulam Sakhi and other family members told the media outside the court. 
Sehar Batool’s body was found in a heap of garbage on Zarghoon Road in November 2014. Pursuing the case, the Quetta police had arrested the accused who later confessed to raping and murdering the minor girl. 
The case sent shockwaves throughout the country and call for justice was evoked from every corner. Many political and religious groups had also supported the family in pursuing the case. 
Junaid Shehzad, a resident of Quetta’s PSP Colony located on Zarghoon Road where Sehar’s family also lives, kidnapped her from near her house while she was playing and murdered her after raping her. 
During the investigation, the rapist confessed that he along with his brother had tried to shift Sehar’s body to Combined Military Hospital, but fear of being caught compelled them to dump her in a heap of garbage. 
The court’s decision has been lauded and it is being hoped that through this, faith in the country’s judicial system will be restored. SHARE
