Former SSP Malir Rao Anwar who was declared as an absconder from Supreme Court of Pakistan has been arrested from Supreme Court on Wednesday, March 21st, 2018. Rao Anwar appeared in the court in front of the 3 member bench headed by CJP Justice Saqib Nisar who were hearing the case proceedings in the extrajudicial murder of Naqeebullah Mahsud. CJP ordered Sindh police to arrest him and rejected the request for protective bail for SSP Rao Anwar that was sought by his counselor. 
Rao Anwar was on the run since a case was filed against him and his team to kill innocent Naqeebullah Mehsud along with 3 other confirmed terrorists from Tahreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The family of the victim Naqeebullah said he had o connections with TTP at all, he was killed and murdered because of his ties with North Waziristan. He appeared dramatically in Supreme Court in white Toyota Corolla along with security officials and was taken into custody of Sindh Police. 
CJP ordered Sindh police to take Rao Anwar into custody and IG Sindh AD Khawaja will be responsible for his protection until the final conclusion of the Naqeebullahâ€™s murder case. CJP also ordered State Bank of Pakistan to unfreeze his bank accounts and his salary must be transferred into his bank accounts so that his family and children can use that money to avoid any sort of difficulty and trouble. 
Justice Saqib Nisar also ordered to form a Joint Investigation Team with the officials of intelligence services and this JIT will be led by additional IG Sindh Police Aftab Pathan and four senior officers of Sindh Police. Was this helpful?
