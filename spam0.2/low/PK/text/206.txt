GUJRANWALA: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Imran Khan on Wednesday said that it was Punjab CM Shehbaz Sharif’s turn next after his brother, Nawaz Sharif’s disqualification. 
The PTI chief was addressing party workers in Gujranwala where he was present to participate in the party’s membership campaign.“We have to rid Punjab of the Sharifs in 2018,” he said, promising party workers that PTI would provide relief to the masses if it comes to power in the upcoming general elections. Imran alleged that Shehbaz had spent six and a half trillion rupees of Punjab’s development budget in the past ten years yet he had failed to construct a single reliable hospital in the province.“Do you know why Shehbaz is in London…he is there for a medical checkup,” Imran said. “Kulsoom Nawaz is also being treated in London but the common man cannot afford to go abroad.” He claimed that the same medicines available in Punjab for a hundred rupees can be purchased for fifty rupees in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa — where his party formed the government after the elections in 2013.
