“My body retired in 2009, but I think my heart just finally couldn’t propel myself to play anymore,” Grant said in April 2017 . “I took a nasty hit in indoor for the Mammoth this year and got a concussion, and the risk of trying to come back is just not worth it.” 
Grant’s jersey will be the fourth to be lifted to the rafters by the Mammoth, joining Gary Gait (No. 22), Brian Langry (6) and Gavin Prout (9).
