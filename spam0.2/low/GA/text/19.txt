DETROIT — The Detroit Pistons made an honorary call-up Thursday of G-League guard Zeke Upshaw, who died on Monday. 
“As we look to memorialize Zeke’s basketball career and continue to support his family during this tragically difficult time, executing an honorary call-up recognizes his standing as a member of the Pistons family,” general manager Jeff Bower said. 
Upshaw was playing for the Grand Rapids Drive, Detroit’s G-League affiliate, when he collapsed late in Saturday’s game against the Long Island Nets. He died two days later of what the Kent County Medical Examiner determined to be heart disease. 
The 26-year-old was playing in his second season for Grand Rapids, averaging 7.6 points in 75 games. He played at Illinois State and Hofstra, and after going undrafted, he played in Slovenia and Luxembourg.
