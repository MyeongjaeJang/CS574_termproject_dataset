Upon its release on April 2 at 6 p.m. KST, “Lady” ranked high on domestic and international music charts. The song placed No. 1 on real time charts on Korean music sites Bugs and Soribada as well as China’s largest music site Yinyuetai. 
LE said, “I hadn’t even imagined it, but thank you for giving us so much love. I will work hard to repay you for your love with performances during our promotions.” 
Junghwa commented, “It’s something that I didn’t predict, so it feels surreal. Many people like it, so my worries and concerns have disappeared and it makes me think that I should have more fun while promoting. I will repay this grateful feeling with performances while working hard during our promotions.” 
Hyerin said, “After ‘DDD,’ thank you for listening a lot to ‘Lady.’ I will continue the remaining promotions with a joyful heart. Thank you so much.” 
LE, who participated in producing and writing the track, said, “It was a concept that was hard for us to try because of our image. Since many people have expectations about our sexiness, we hesitated. The track came out and it was perfect for retro. Since the song came out that way, we thought that it was a good chance for us to try it.” 
EXID concluded, “We want to broaden the scope of where we can challenge ourselves. We want to hear that EXID has no limits. We have lots of possibilities and good individual capabilities, and still have more things to show. This album was one of them. We want to hear that EXID is a group that people look forward to seeing in the future.”
