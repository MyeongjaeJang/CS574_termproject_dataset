Minister of Youth, Sport and Child Development Moses Mawere says the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) is at liberty to hire an expatriate coach as long as they can afford to pay him. 
In an interview in Lusaka on Tuesday with Zambia Daily Mail, Mawere said his ministry will only intervene in the recruitment of an expatriate coach if the matter is brought to their attention. 
“First of all, if they [FAZ] decide to fire and re-engage a coach themselves, that means they have the capacity to pay him [new coach]. They are at liberty to fire and hire as long as they are able to raise their own money to pay the coach,” he said 
Last week FAZ President Andrew Kamanga said they were convening a technical committee meeting to discuss Nyirenda’s future. 
FAZ is under pressure from the Chipolopolo faithful who are calling for the sacking of Wada Wada. 
“We are calling a technical committee and I don’t want to pre-empt what will be discussed there. 
“Certainly, we are going to review his ( Wedson Nyirenda) performance,” Kamanga said on Muvi TV’s the Assignment programme. 
Kamanga also revealed that he is aware that fans want Wada ‘kicked out’ but he has categorically stated he doesn’t have ‘absolute power to fire’ the embattled coach. 
“Of course, I know there is general feeling that Wada must be kicked out almost immediately but I do not have the absolute power to fire. The process to review the coach’s performance against set targets is on-going,” He added. 
Government is bankrolling Nyirenda’s salary which has been estimated and speculated to be around $10, 000. [Zambia Daily Mail/ZamFoot]
