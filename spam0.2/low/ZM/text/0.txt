2017 Zambia super league runners up Sensational Zanaco started their 2018 campaign with a resounding two nil win over Zambia national service sponsored out-fit Green Eagles. 
The bankers had to wait for the second half to score their first goal of the game as Eagles managed to hold them off in the first half. National team winger Ernest Mbewe had the best chance of the first half but missed an open goal forcing Coach Numba Mumamba to replace him with Guily Manziba. 
The bankers finally broke the deadlock ing the 63rd minute when Martin Phiri’s thumping header from a Charles Zulu cross went past Robert Mwanza in the Eagles goal. 
Isaac Chansa put the result to bed in the 79th minute after connecting with Manziba’s low cross in the box. 
The bankers run away two nil victors as they opened their campaign for the season. For their week three fixture they face Lusaka Dynamos this Friday. Share this:
