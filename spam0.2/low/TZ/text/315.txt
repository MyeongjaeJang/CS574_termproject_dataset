Dar es Salaam. Police yesterday arrested opposition lawmaker Halima Mdee (pictured) at Julius Nyerere International Airport (JNIA). 
Chadema Central Committee member Boniface Jacob confirmed that the Kawe MP was arrested shortly after arriving from South Africa. 
“I can confirm that Ms Mdee was arrested at 3am at JNIA upon her arrival from South Africa, where she had been receiving medical treatment. She was taken to the Central Police Station,” Mr Jacob, who is also the Ubungo mayor, told The Citizen. 
Reached for comment, Dar es Salaam Special Police Zone Commander Lazaro Mambosasa said they had arrested Ms Mdee for jumping bail, adding that the MP would be joined in the case against six other Chadema cadres tomorrow. 
“It’s true that we have arrested her. She jumped bail and travelled to South Africa. Since she was supposed to be in remand, we will keep her locked up until Tuesday when she will be joined in the case,” he said. 
Chadema chairman Freeman Mbowe, secretary-general Vincent Mashinji, deputy secretaries-general John Mnyika (Mainland) and Salum Mwalimu (Zanzibar), Iringa Urban MP Peter Msigwa and Tarime Urban MP Ester Matiko were remanded last Tuesday after they were charged with sedition and incitement. 
They were also charged with taking part in an illegal demonstration in Dar es Salaam in February. They deny all charges. advertisement
