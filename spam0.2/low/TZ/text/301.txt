Dar es Salaam. The Rotary Club Arusha (RCA) inducted three new members late last month. 
Those inducted to Rotary International include Ms Laura Minde, Ms Marcelina Bandie and Mr Eric Rowberg. 
Rotary Club of Arusha says it has already inducted five new members this year alone. 
The Rotary Club is a global organisation of people who apply their leadership, expertise, and diverse perspectives to solving social issues and build lifelong friendships in the process. 
To be inducted or become a member, one must have spotted some qualities possessed, before being invited to attend the club meetings, where you learn more about the rotary club. 
Thereafter prospective member CV is circulated amongst the club members and after review they either approve or reject member induction. 
“I feel quite privileged to be part of this club that believes in service above self and high ethical standards,” said Ms Laura Minde, one of the candidates. (Mnaku Mbani) 
“Through this platform I can share my expertise and knowledge to my community and reach abroad audience that I may not reach individually and have the support of the club.” 
She added; “After my induction I am looking forward to offering my services to youth projects, particularly on work ethics and career development.” advertisement
