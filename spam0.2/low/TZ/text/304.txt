Gold Coast. Australian Olympic swimming champion Mack Horton said yesterday he had no regrets over calling out athletes caught cheating -- as he did in no uncertain terms at the 2016 Rio Games. 
Horton tore into China’s Sun Yang in Brazil two years ago after robbing him of his Olympic 400 metres freestyle title, sniffing: “I don’t have time or respect for drug cheats.”

His comments sparked fury from Chinese journalists who confronted Horton at his victory press conference, demanding to know why he had used such frank language. advertisement
