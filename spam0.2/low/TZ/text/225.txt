Dar es Salaam. Members of the central committee of the main opposition party, Chadema, converge for a meeting today, March 29, to discuss various issues. 

The meeting comes when top brass party officials are in custody, charged with taking part in alleged unlawful demonstrations. 

The news of the meeting was revealed by the spokespersons of the party, Mr Tumaini Makene when contacted by The Citizen via telephone. 

“The meeting will be held today. However, it will depend on how the court session ends,” he explained via a text message. 

Mr Makene, nonetheless, declined to disclose the venue where the central committee members will meet. 

Meanwhile, the Chedema national chairman, Mr Freeman Mbowe and other top leaders were set to appear before Kisutu Resident Magistrates’ Court, where ruling on their bail application is expected to be made. 
Mr Mbowe, Dr Vincent Mashinji (Secretary General), Mr John Mnyika (Deputy Secretary General (Mainland), Mr Salum Mwalimu (Deputy Secretary General, Zanzibar), Rev Peter Msigwa (Member of Parliament, Iringa Urban) and Ms Esther Matiko (MP for Tarime Urban) were charged on Tuesday facing eight counts of sedition. 

Resident Magistrate in-charge Wilbard Mashauri yesterday ordered the accused to remain in remand until today when he will deliver his ruling on whether to grant them bail or not after going through the competing submissions presented by the prosecution and defence. advertisement
