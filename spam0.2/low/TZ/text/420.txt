Dar es Salaam. Despite shrinking yields, investors’ appetite on government debt instruments continued to remain strong, after Treasury bills floated on Wednesday this week ended up being oversubscribed. 
According to the T-Bills auction summary published by Bank of Tanzania, yields fell to 3.92 per cent during Wednesday’s auction from 4.54 per cent during the previous float held on March 21, this year. 
T-Bills maturing within one month have continued to fetch no yield while three months maturity yield bills fell to 2.15 per cent on Wednesday from 2.25 per cent during the March 21 float. 
The yield for six months maturity dropped to 3.16 per cent on Wednesday from 3.32 per cent recorded during the previous auction, while yield for one year maturity was slightly down at 5.09 per cent from 5.12 per cent recorded during the previous auction. Analysts expect the rates to fall further due to strong demand for government debt instruments, as they are more secure than any other areas of investments in financial markets. 
Wednesday’s auction results summary shows that a total of 73 bids valued at Sh178.14 billion were tendered against an offer of Sh169 billion, an oversubscription of Sh9 billion. However, an oversubscription for the Wednesday’s float was lower than that of Sh55 billion recorded during the previous auction held on March 21. The summary shows that at the end of the auction, only 62 bids valued at Sh115 billion were successful, lower than the offered amount. 
Many bids were received for the six-month maturity bills, but one-year maturity bills were undersubscribed while one month maturity did not receive any bid. 
The six months maturity received 24 bids valued Sh106 billion but only 20 worth Sh65 billion were successful, which was equivalent to the offered amount. 
One year maturity bill received 44 bids valued Sh67 billion but BoT accepted 41 bids worth Sh47 billion, lower than the Sh100 billion offered. advertisement
