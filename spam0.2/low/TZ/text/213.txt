Dar es Salaam. The Five-Year Treasury Bond (T-Bond), floated by the Bank of Tanzania (BoT), was oversubscribed by close to 200 per cent on Wednesday, March 28, 2018 as investors’ appetite for risk-free securities remain high despite reducing yields. 

The T-Bond, which carries lowered yields of 9.18 per cent, was oversubscribed by a cool Sh165 billion, market data show. 
The government, through the BoT, sought to collect Sh90 billion, via the T-Bond. 
However, investors tendered a total of 167 bids, valued Sh255 billion. 
The BoT accepted only 71 bids valued Sh90 billion. 
The massive oversubscription is despite the fact yields on government securities have been going down in recent months in monetary policy action that seeks to increases the supply of credit in the economy. 
For instance, yields upon maturity have been lowered to 11.05 per cent during the Wednesday’s float from 12.16 per cent recorded during a similar bond floated in January. Similarly, the coupon yield went down to 9.888 per cent from 10.3 per cent. 
The yield upon maturity was also lower than 13.64 per cent recorded in January last year, and 12.16 per cent in January this year, according to Monthly Economic Review for February issued by BoT. 
In Wednesday’s auction, the highest bid was 95.7072/100 while lowest bid was at 80.0553/100 but the minimum successful price was 91.8191/100. advertisement
