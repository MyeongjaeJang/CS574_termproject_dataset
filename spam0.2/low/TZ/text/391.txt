Dar es Salaam. His Highness the Aga Khan has shown interest to invest in Tanzania’s Pharmaceutical industry, a cabinet minister has revealed. 

The Minister for Industry, Trade and Investment, Mr Charles Mwijage said on Wednesday 4 April that the government was planning to work closely with the founder and chairman of the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) in ensuring that the planned investment is realised. 

"I have planned a meeting with the Attorney General to see how we can execute the Aga Khan’s initiative in this particular area,” Mr Mwijage told participants to the meeting that brought together government officials and investors with a view to attracting investments into the pharmaceutical sector. 

He said the Aga Khan has contributed a lot in Tanzania's health sector especially through hospitals, medical insurance cover and training of medical experts. 

"The government is determined to have his ideas fully implemented as we soldier on with our goal of industrializing Tanzania," he added. 

The director general for the Medical Stores Department (MSD), Mr Laurean Bwanakunu said Tanzania needs a formidable local pharmaceutical industry to save the huge amount that is currently spent on importation of drugs and other medical equipment. 

"I'm happy to hear that the government is now encouraging sourcing locally," he said. advertisement
