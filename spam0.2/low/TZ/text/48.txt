Dar es Salaam. The emergency of bugs that attack heap tomatoes is likely to increase the shortage of the crop for consumers based in Dar es Salaam and other urban centres. 
Farmers say the bugs have caused spread of heap tomato disease, which affects yields. 
The existing shortage is due to the on-going rain which has damaged fields and in some places washed away crops in the farms. 
A spot-check in different markets has also indicated that an increased shortage of the crop has automatically pushed up both wholesale and retail prices. Kariakoo market data shows wholesale price for a 50-kilo bag of heap tomato rose from between Sh35,000 and Sh40,000 on February 20 to Sh50,000 and Sh60,000 recorded mid-March. 
At the same time the retail price has also increased from between Sh1,500 and Sh2,000 per bundle to between Sh1,800 and Sh2,500. 
Speaking to The Citizen, Mr Mbaraka Mandai, a farmer based in Ikwiriri confirmed over the outbreak of bugs attacking heap tomatoes, saying it was normal in the rain season. 
“Continued rains offer perfect environment for the breeding of these pests. The problem is when they attack the crops, the fruits start rotting even before they are ready for harvest,” said Mr Mandai adding that farms near rivers have also been affected by floods and muds. 
Kariakoo Market Corporation planning and statistical officer Henry Rwejuna said low supply of heap tomato is mainly caused by low supply from the main sources. 
“Most heap tomatoes consumed in the city come from Ruvu, Rufiji, Bagamoyo and Ikwiriri in Coast Region. 
Most of the farmers use irrigation method around River Rufiji and Ruvu. advertisement
