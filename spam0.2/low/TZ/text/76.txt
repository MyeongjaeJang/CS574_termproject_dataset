“The “two experiences” here refer to the Chinese experience of government supporting agricultural development and the Chinese experience of labour-intensive agricultural technology,” said Mr Qixin. 
He added that through the sharing of “two experiences”, the program will also explore a wider range a poverty reduction programme models that focus on food security through technical means and based on people’s exchange, which will in turn contribute to the ongoing attempt to create effective China-Africa cooperation models for sustainable development.
