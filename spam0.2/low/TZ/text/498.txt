Johannesburg. Oscar Pistorius, former South African Paralympic athlete, suffered a heavy blow on Monday after his request was dismissed to appeal against his 13-year jail term, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said. 
Pistorius had asked the Constitutional Court to review the jail term, which was increased to 13 years in November. “The application for leave to appeal is dismissed,” a South African court ruled on Monday, adding it was not a constitutional matter. 
The ruling was dated March 28. “I don’t foresee any other option for Oscar, this is the end of the road for Mr Pistorius,” NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku told Xinhua on Monday. (Xinhua) 
“We received an order from the ConCourt that specifically says that his application for leave to appeal has been dismissed due to the fact that it does not fall within the jurisdiction of the ConCourt,” he added. Pistorius killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine’s Day in 2013. He fired four times through the locked door of his bedroom toilet, later saying that he thought she was an intruder. advertisement
