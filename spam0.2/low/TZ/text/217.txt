Nairobi. Smartphone users are set to limit the number of hours spent on mobile gadgets due to safety concerns, a Deloitte survey has predicted. The research notes that people with smartphones look at their gadgets 50 times a day on average, a big distraction to their jobs. 
The Deloitte survey, however, predicts that mobile phone penetration will surpass 90 per cent in the developing world by 2023. 
“While the outlook for smartphone penetration remains largely positive, Deloitte predicts that in 2018, 45 per cent of all adult smartphone users will worry that they are using their phones too much for certain activities and will limit their phone usage in various ways. 
“This points to the distracting effect of smartphone use,” said Nikhil Hira, Deloitte East Africa Technology, Media and Telecommunication leader at a press briefing in Nairobi on Tuesday. 
According to the survey that was based on aggregate insights generated from conversations with media and telecoms companies across the world, social media, access to video and news were found to be the most popular smartphone activities among Kenyans. Social media visits emerged as the top with 56 per cent stating that it was for general use. This was followed by watching videos at 45 per cent, while following news stories came in third. (NMG)
