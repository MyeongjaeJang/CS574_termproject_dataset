Sido regional officer Charles Iganja handed over the kits at Nyamisisi Village on Wednesday, March 27. “My office will make a follow-up on the progress of the groups after being provided with training.” He said that was part of the organisation’s project introduced to support the government’s industrialisation drive. Sido has been implementing the project in cooperation Tools for Self-Reliance – a British non-governmental organisation. The aim is to support rural development groups in the region. “Our research findings have established that development groups are short of tools.

A representative of the groups, Mr Kennedy Nyeko, thanked Sido for the support. advertisement
