Dar es Salaam. Defending champion Gerald Miller will look on as a host of top drivers jostle for points in round two of the National Rally Championship (NRC) in Moshi, Kilimanjaro early next month. 
The Arusha-based driver, who also missed out on the opening round in Tanga last month, will have to play catch up in his title defence. 
“There is great interest in the national championship, let them battle in Moshi. I will recover those points in the next round,” he was quoted as saying yesterday. 
Fifteen drivers have so far confirmed their participation in the rally scheduled for April 7 to 8, according to event coordinator, Fahim Aloo. 
Aloo confirmed that Miller was a notable absentee in the list of drivers lined up for 145km race. 
He said Miller has opted to skip the Moshi rally because he is fine-tuning ahead of the forthcoming Kenya’s rally. 
Last month, Miller’s arch-rival Dharam Pandya made a bright start to the 2018 motor sport season after hitting the podium in the Tanga Rally. 
Using the services of one of the best navigators in East Africa, Moses Matovu, Pandya beat the rest of the 11 cars to open the new season on high note in their Subaru Imprezza VAB edition. 
The Dar driver looked well set to notch his maiden victory right from the opening day. 
Pandya, who finished runners-up last season, which was dominated by Miller, has notched valuable points to his collection kitty ahead of next month’s Moshi rally. 
Pandya forms a new generation of rally drivers has been highly jovial of the victory after a season that saw him finish second. advertisement
