Dar es Salaam. After a long wait, the third aircraft for Air Tanzania touched ground at the Julius Nyerere International Airport (JNIA) on Monday, 02 April 2018. 
The plane, a Bombardier Q-400, touched ground at 5.07 PM, with President John Magufuli gracing the event to receive it. 
Upon touching down, the plane received a water salute, involving firefighting rigs spraying arcs of water over it as a sign of respect, honour and gratitude. 
The government has purchased the plane for $32 million from Canada's Bombardier Aerospace. 
It is the third in a total of six aircrafts that President John Magufuli’s administration plans to purchase to revive the state-owned Air Tanzania. 
"We will receive three more aircrafts. This time, jets. We will have a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner and two Bombardier C300 series. They will arrive before the end of this year,” President Magufuli said. advertisement
