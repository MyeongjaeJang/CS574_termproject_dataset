New Delhi. Nepal’s cricket sensation Sandeep Lamichhane Saturday urged the game’s administrators to increase the number of teams in the World Cup and give associate nations a better chance of playing on the sport’s biggest stage. Lamichhane, 17, and his teammates made history earlier this month when Nepal gained one-day international status at the World Cup qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe.
