Dodoma. The Member of Parliament for Ulanga(CCM), Goodkuck Mlinga on Wednesday April 11 decried violation of family privacy at the Dar es Salaam Regional Commissioner's help desk. 
Mr Mlinga told the parliament that he was concerned about pictures of 'innocent children which are being circulated on social media in connection with paternity disputes. 
The MP sought the guidance of the Bunge chairperson, Najma Abdallah, asking the parliament to deliberate on the approach being used to solve paternity disputes. 
"I am not against the fact that we need to stop this habit of abandoning children. But I am concerned about the approach," said the MP. 
"In child protection laws of this country, children must be shielded from such conflicts because they are innocent but we have seen their pictures being circulated on social media, exposing their identities. We need to intervene," he added. 
However, the Bunge chairperson responded saying Parliament should wait until the entire process in Dar es Salaam comes to an end. That's when any legal disputes arising from it would be discussed according to the parliamentary standing orders. advertisement
