Fans have been patiently waiting for Rae Sremmurd’s forthcoming album SremmLife 3 since it was first teased last year, and while the album hasn’t received an official release date, Swae Lee promised to deliver “something special” for his loyal devotees this Friday. 
On Tuesday , Lee hopped on Instagram to update fans on the status of the long-awaited SremmLife 3, which will find the rappers getting back to their “original formula.” 
“I will give you everything every form of my artistry just went through mixes production is sounding very full,” Lee wrote. “Triple disk play each song one by one each has its own story and behind the scene story it’s sticking to our original formula which is to get people on their feet SremmLife 3 dripping very soon!” Then, he slipped in a little announcement and teased that he has “special something for you on April 6th mark your calendars.” 
In an interview with Rolling Stone, Lee shared that his side of the three-disc project is “crazy melodic” and even features a song named after his ex-girlfriend titled “Little Marliesia.” 
Lee also discussed his love for animals, especially his pet monkey Lil G, which he paid a cool $20,000 and a baby monkey named Naya. “I like wildlife. I wanna go in the jungle and see elephants and shit. I’m gonna go to the Amazon,” he said. “Anyone fucking with wildlife, poaching them, they need to be taken out. They corny for that. Shout out to PETA.” advertisement
