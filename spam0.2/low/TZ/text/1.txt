Dar es Salaam. Industries, consumers and the entire Tanzanian population will be casualties of the proposed idea by the Tanzanian Revenue Authority (TRA) that seeks to track production in factories, a business leader has warned. 
The newly introduced Excisable Goods Management System (EGMS) is expected to be installed in every factory’s product lines, putting excise duty stamps on every unit produced by those factories. 
Speaking during the 11th Tanzanian National Business Council (TNBC) meeting held at State House, Dar es Salaam, on Monday, Serengeti Breweries managing director Hellene Weesie expressed her fears that businesses would suffer irreparable damage if the system was implemented, noting that the affected industries stood to lose over Sh260 billion annually by purchasing and installing the machines whose cost would not benefit the country. 
“In principle, we have nothing against the system if only it comes with zero costs, but with its accompanying high costs, it means that the industries will incur extra costs, thus compelling them to significantly increase the prices of their products which will not only impact on the customers and consumers, but will also lead to a significant reduction in government revenue,” Ms Weesie said. 
She urged TRA to reconsider the proposal, adding that its implementation might reverse the gains already made in the industrial sector, something that would adversely affect consumers, the business community and the entire population. 
Last year, reports said that TRA had plans to implement the EGM system on selected industrial area, including the manufacture of beverage, cigarettes and textiles, among others. advertisement
