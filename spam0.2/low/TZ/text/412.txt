Dar es Salaam. Young Africans will be without a number of key players when they go head to head with Ethiopia’s Welayta Dicha in the Confederation Cup tomorrow, it has been revealed. 
Smarting from their ouster from the Total CAF Champions League, Yanga are desirous of better outing in the CAF Confederation Cup. 
But they will be unfortunate not to have on board defender Kelvin Yondani, midfielders Papy Tshishimbi and Said Juma in the play-off first leg tie at the National Stadium. 
Striker Obrey Chirwa, one of the forwards Yanga bank on for goals in domestic and international club competitions, has also been ruled out of the clash. 
The players are still serving a one match ban after being booked twice in their past games, according to the Confederation of African Football (Caf). 
Ethiopia’s Welayta Dicha are now undergoing light training in the city ahead of the clash. 
Meanwhile, Rayon Sports coach Ivan Minneart has said confidence will be vital for his side in their match against Costa do Sol of Mozambique on Friday in Kigali. 
“Yes we can be satisfied because we were not drawn against big teams like Supersports (South Africa), Algeria and Moroccan teams which are highly rated. 
But we need to treat the game like we did against Mamelodi Sundowns,” Minneart said. 
“We have to stop them from scoring and we need to do everything in best way to win. We have to be ready and be at our top ahead of the game. We should be ready from the first minute to the last” he added 
Rayon dropped to CAF Confederation Cup after a 2-0 aggregate loss at the hands of Sundowns at the 1/16th round of the Total CAF Champions League. advertisement
