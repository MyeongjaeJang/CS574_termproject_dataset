FRAUD 

Article 41 (1 a &b) of the Uganda Communications Act, 2013, mandates the commission to suspend and revoke operating license of any media house on the grounds of serious and repeated breach of the license conditions, and any fraud or intentional misrepresentation by the operator. 
MsAnkunda said the radio stations were warned before the closure that they were operating below the minimum broadcasting standards as set by the UCC. 

She said the radio stations will be allowed back on air only if they commit themselves against broadcasting any content linked to witchcraft or involve in any activity that in one way or the other aids and abets electronic fraud. 
MsAnkunda advised the radio stations to train their presenters some of the dos and don’ts of journalism so as to avoid the same fate in the future. advertisement
