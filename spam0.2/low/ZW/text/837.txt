Fungai Muderere NOT all that glitters is gold! 
The lure of big money has seen two Zimbabwean players sign for Saudi Arabian clubs only to make hasty exits out of the rich country. 
Months after Warriors forward Tendai Ndoro decided to end his disastrous short spell in Saudi Arabia and retrace to South Africa’s Absa Premiership, another Zimbabwe international Erick Chipeta is reportedly on the verge of completing a return to the Super Diski after he agreed to a mutual termination of his contract with Saudi Arabian side Al Ra’ed FC. 
The 27-year-old former Hwange and Chippa United player joined Al Ra’ed in January after signing an 18-month long deal with an option to renew based on performances. 
The centre-back, who was last year part of the Warriors Cosafa Cup winning squad, never made his debut for the Saudi club leaving him free to sign for another team this season. 
Word has it that the defender is set to sign with Platinum Stars in a short-term deal until the end of the season with an option to renew. 
Spirited efforts to get a comment from the player and his representatives Mede8 Sports Management Agency drew a blank. 
Chipeta joined Al Ra’ed FC after leaving Ajax Cape Town, a club that is interestingly now home to Ndoro. 
Although monetary figures of Chipeta’s deal with the Saudi club were not revealed when he put pen to paper in January, Ndoro’s move seemed to suggest all was rosy in Saudi Arabia. 
Before the ink had dried or even newspapers gone to bed, Ndoro had told the world about his move to Arab rich Al Faisaly FC on a two-year contract which was said to be worth more than $500 000. And just before newspapers went to bed on Monday, Tuesday and so on he had disclosed with aid of pictures that the club had given him a brand new Jaguar XF car and an iPhone7. 
However, despite the financial gains accrued from the move, Ndoro struggled to adjust to life in the oil-rich gulf nation, scoring just one goal in four appearances before deciding to retrace his roots to South Africa. 
The move saw Ndoro reunite with Turkish coach Muhsin Ertugral, who he worked under at Mpumalanga Black Aces and briefly at Pirates. 
“It was an easy decision. I was in Saudi Arabia and the club (Ajax Cape Town) approached me, then I didn’t have to wait, I just said: ‘Here in Saudi Arabia, I’m struggling, I have to go back home where I started.’ So it was a better opportunity for me again to come and join Ajax Cape Town, and join the greatest coach (Mushin) ever,” said Ndoro soon after joining Ajax Cape Town. 
And the biggest question is, should Zimbabwean players continue to go Arabic? 
Answer: Tell them Chipeta and Ndoro.
