From the moment i cut that ribbon, i am informed that we now have 30 megawatts of power generation transmitted into our national grid," he says. He also said this is the state of the art engineering and technology worldwide which is now resident in the country at the Nyaminyami adding that he has no doubt that the people of Zimbabwe or engineers and technicians will definitely look after this asset and maintain it for the good of the country. Zimbabwe had been experiencing power shortages with a deficit of up to 600 megawatts which were being sourced from regional power utilities which include Eskom of South Africa, Caho-bassa of Mozambique and SNEL of DRC, forcing the nation to spend between $7 million and $10 million weekly. The Kariba South expansion programme is part of government's infrastructure and utilities cluster under ZIM ASSET. - zbc
