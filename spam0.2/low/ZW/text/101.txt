AmaZulu midfielder Butholezwe Ncube is delighted to be included in the Warriors squad for the first time and has promised to use the chance to impress the team’s technical team for future assignments. 
Zimbabwe will participate in a four-nation tournament this week which also includes Angola, South Africa and the hosts Zambia. 
Ncube told NewsDay that it has been his wish to play for the national team. 
“It’s an honour for me to be called up to the national team to represent Zimbabwe,” he said. 
“It has always been a wish for me to play for my country. I want to add my part as well in achieving something for my country.” 
The South Africa-based player is one of the five players, who were called for the first time by Warriors coach Sunday Chidzambga in a 20-man squad. Other new faces in the squad are British-born Zimbabweans Adam Chicksen and Alec Mudimu. Share this:
