Three Monkeys sets record straight   THREE Monkeys, a restaurant in Victoria Falls whose directors initially refused to comment in stories reported by B-Metro have reached out through lawyers to "correct inaccuracies".While admitting that directors, namely Ilan Wiesenbacher and Martin Pieters, refused to comment in all the stories, they have now spoken through lawyers Webb, Low and Barry to "set the record straight. The first article was published on 9 March 2018 with the headline "Monkey Business at Three Monkeys".The lawyers say, "our clients do not appreciate their company being referred to as a 'monkey business'," reads their letter.The headline "monkey business" is simple English referring to mischievous or deceitful behaviour which is characteristic of the story being reported whereby one of the shareholders John Mpofu made allegations that his other partners backtracked on initial promises made to him.But because the story was based on Mpofu's narrative and that of other sources and that Wiesenbacher and Pieters refused to comment, Mpofu was referred to as a director which his partners now dispute.However, B-Metro is also in possession of documentation that proves Mpofu's directorship.As a matter of fact a copy of the company's CR 14 papers reveals that they are registered as Carnipes Investment Private Limited and lists the three Mpofu, Wiesenbacher and Pieters as directors.Nonetheless, Wiesenbacher and Pieters insist Mpofu has a cameo role in the business."He's just a minority shareholder as his directorship was previously removed," reads the response.Further checks with Mpofu reveal that his other two partners informed him of their intentions to scratch him through an extra-ordinary meeting on 30 November last year. He claims to have told them that he was away at the time. They then told him they would go ahead with the meeting since they are majority shareholders. Since then, no formal communication has reached Mpofu.They concluded their response by saying they never agreed to build a house for Mpofu and when they joined him in the partnership, he was constructing his own house.The second story followed on 16 March 2018, titled, "More trouble for Three Monkeys."The directors say they did not see a petition allegedly written to them.But the Victoria Falls Residents Association chairman Morgan Gaza as quoted by B-Metro said they summoned the restaurant's directors on the said issues of overlooking locals.B-Metro called Gaza again this week and he confirmed summoning the directors. - bmetro
