Felton Kamambo reveals why he quit ZIFA 
Soccer24 on 31 Mar, 2018 
Former ZIFA executive member Felton Kamambo has explained why he quit the association. 
Kamambo together with another board member Piraishe Mabhena announced their resignation on Wednesday. The move has caused debate in the local football scene as many believed it’s meant to trigger some changes in the organisation as it requires the elections to be held within two months. 
In a statement, Kamambo alleges that the current administration has failed to deliver their mandate. He says other board members tried to embrace good corporate governance during their 2 years in office, but the efforts we met with fierce resistance from the ZIFA presidium. 
When they try to engage the presidium, they would be labelled rebels. Late board member, Edzai Kasinauyo was a victim of such circumstances who was cleared by courts of concocted match-fixing allegations but was never accepted back into the ZIFA board for reasons best known by the ZIFA presidium. 
Kamambo insists the current executive’s term of office ended on 29th March 2018, and the Secretary-General was supposed to take over inline with the ZIFA constitution as 50% of the positions became vacant. 
The former official added that the attempt by Philip Chiyangwa to appoint members from Premier Soccer League and women football was an illegitimate arrangement which violates the Zifa statutes for selfish reasons. Regularising co-options was rubbished by some of our board members. 
On the “Sandton project” Kamambo dismissed the allegations as unfounded stories of non-existent projects.
