Bongani Charamuromo had pleaded with Harare Civil Court magistrate Lazini Ncube to evict Noleen Chipfeve saying their relationship was motivated by money. 
“We used to live together at my elder brother’s home and we fell in love and she asked for money so we could be intimate,” he said. 
“She came to my house in February after her brother saw our WhatsApp messages and discovered she was pregnant.” 
Charamuromo claimed Chipfeve broke into his house using a spoon and a knife. He said he did not want to live with his cousin as she had a child with another man. 
“She told me to give her $300 so she could leave me alone,” he said. “But she refused to leave after I gave her the money.” 
Chipfeve said Charamuromo had forced her to quit her job as a maid after promising to marry her.
