Ibrahimovic announces his arrival at LA Galaxy in a bizarre way

Zlatan Ibrahimovic has announced his arrival in America in a bizarre way by taking out a full-page ad in the LA Times, an American newspaper. 
The advert simply states: “Dear Los Angeles, You’re welcome.” 
The page is signed by Ibrahimovic, with his name printed underneath with “#9” revealing his shirt number. LA Galaxy’s badge was placed next to it. 
A full-page advert in the LA Times costs around $19,000. 
The Swedish player moved to the USA after Manchester United terminated the striker’s contract on Thursday, announcing he would leave the club with immediate effect. 
The 36-year-old enjoyed a successful first season at Old Trafford, helping lead the Red Devils to EFL Cup and Europa League glory with 28 goals, but a knee injury has prevented him from getting back to his best levels. Share this:
