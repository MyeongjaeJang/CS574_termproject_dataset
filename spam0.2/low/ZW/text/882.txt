Antipas Wants More Flavour

Chicken Inn moved into the second position after beating Mutare City Rovers 2-1, but coach Joey Antipas is not amused. 
Darryl Nyandoro scored both goals in the second half for the Gamecocks while Billy Vheremu got the consolation for Rovers. 
But the coach decried his strike force for lacking potency in front of goal after wasted numerous chances. 
“We needed the three points, and that is why we wanted to go forward. We did everything from defence, created lots of chances. We had to bring in Darryl Nyandoro who made the difference,” said Antipas. 
“We were a bit porous at the defence because when they scored that goal we had gone to sleep. 
“We need to tighten ourselves at the back but otherwise, it was a good match, and the most important thing is we got 3 points,” he added. Share this:
