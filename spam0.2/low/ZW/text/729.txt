Zidane has no faith in me – Isco 
  
Isco has revealed that playing for Spain during the international break was a relief as he feels Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane has no faith in him. 
The forward scored a hat-trick against Argentina in a friendly on Tuesday. 
With his current form, the 25-year-old has become a key player under coach Julen Lopetegui and is expected to start at this summer’s World Cup in a front three alongside Diego Costa and David Silva. 
But Zidane has not shown the same faith in him at Madrid, where Isco has often found himself on the bench behind the likes of Marco Asensio and Lucas Vazquez. 
“Lopetegui gives me confidence with minutes, with games,” Isco said. 
“With Madrid I do not have the confidence that a player needs, maybe the problem is me, that I have not won Zidane’s confidence with the good players there.” 
Isco signed a five-year contract with Real in September last year but there would be no shortage of suitors should he decide his future lies elsewhere. 
English Premier League pair Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur are rumoured to be interested in signing Isco. Share this:
