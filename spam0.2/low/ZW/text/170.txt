The pair left for the European country yesterday ahead of the race, slated for Valencia on Saturday. 
Mugomeri, who raced at the IAAF World Cross County event in China, the first time he was attending the prestigious race, is bracing himself for a tough competition. He is still hopeful of doing well. 
“I want to raise my country’s flag high. It’s a very difficult race, considering that we will be competing with good athletes, including Ethiopians and Kenyans, but I am confident that I will post a positive result,’’ he said. 
“I have participated in such races before and I hope to use that experience. I have been preparing for this race for several months and I feel ready. I have put a lot of hard work in this and I believe that hard work pays,’’ he said. 
Murowe was equally optimistic, heading into the race. 
“lt’s a big challenge, but I have trained hard and I am positive I am going to make it,’’ he said. 
Naaz president Tendai Tagara confirmed Mugomeri and Murowe’s trip, adding that he expects them to do well. 
The athletes will take part in the 21km race and this year’s edition is set to attract over 300 athletes, according to the organisers. Related posts:
