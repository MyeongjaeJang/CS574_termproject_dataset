Ngezi Platinum coach Tonderai Ndiraya though happy with a win against Dynamos, was ‘upset’ that his team didn’t score more goals in Thursday 1-0 Castle Lager Premiership win over the glamour boys. 
The win against the Harare giants propelled them to the top of the League making it 3 wins out if 3 as the early pacesetters. 
Xolisani Moyo’s 12th minute strike was all the team needed but it could well have been by a larger scoreline as the Ngezi side missed several other scoring chances especially in the first half. 
In an interview with the Chronicle, Ndiraya acknowledged Dynamos came back stronger in the second half but his defence was resolute as they stuck on the game plan. 
“I am happy for the boys but l feel we should have scored more goals as we created a lot of chances, especially in the first half.”, Ndiraya said Share this:
