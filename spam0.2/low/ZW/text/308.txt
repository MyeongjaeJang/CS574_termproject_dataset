Mnangagwa to simplify import, export processes   President Emmerson Mnangagwa says the government is in the process of simplifying the import and export processes to enhance economic growth.President Mnangagwa said this when he commissioned the $40 million Willowton Refinery Plant in Mutare today."My government is on course to streamline and simplify import and export linkages rules and procedures in the spirit of SADC, COMESA, and the new African Continental Free Trade Area," he said. The President also noted that the opening of the plant shows the confidence that investors now have in the country's economy saying the investment compliments government's call to enhance value addition and beneficiation."This huge investment compliments government's efforts in growing the economy and it will, in turn, grow Zimbabwe's gross domestic product. The coming on board of Willowton Zimbabwe has therefore brought a health competition based in oil expressing and soap producing industries in our economy. This huge investment compliments government's call for value addition and beneficiation of our primary produce from the agricultural sector such as soya beans and sunflower among others," he says," said the President.The company manufactures a wide range of products, which include edible oils, margarines and spreads, toiletries, laundry and bathing soaps, candles, chocolates, baking and industrial fats.Mnangagwa went on to urge the Willowton Group to expand its operations to other communities in Zimbabwe and to take advantage of the company's proximity to Beira port in Mozambique to export its products regionally and internationally."I further urge you to use the market which exists beyond our borders. I have realised that most African countries import both raw materials and finished products for this oil expressing sector, but if we share the advantages and opportunities we have on the African continent we should be able not only to service our continental market but we should also be able to export to the global market," he said. The President encouraged the purchase of locally produced products and implored industry players to continue embracing modern technology."Recently in Kigali, Rwanda where the farming operations signed the African Continental Free Trade Area, the continent (Africa) seeks to develop modernised, mechanised trade and commerce within the continent and link the advantages between products and services that are valuable within the continent. We now realise that the continent has about 1.2 billion people and that is a huge market," he said.President Mnangagwa said his government will continue to eliminate all investment impediments, bottlenecks, public sector, leakage, deliberate inefficiencies and corruption.He said whoever wants to stand in Zimbabwe's way will fall by the wayside as the government seeks to achieve is the desire and aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe, young and old.President Mnangagwa also congratulated Manicaland Province for holding the first investment conference on the 2nd of March 2018 saying the spirit and theme of that conference resonated well with the national spirit and mantra that Zimbabwe is open for business and the country's desire to decentralise the developmental agenda to the grassroots in a bid to improve the quality and a standard of living for all Zimbabweans. - zbc
