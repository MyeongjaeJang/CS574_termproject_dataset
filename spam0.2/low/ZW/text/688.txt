Tendai Ndoro barred from playing for Ajax 
  
Arbitrator Nassir Cassim SC has ruled that the Tendai Ndoro should stop playing for Ajax Cape Town as his matter has been referred to the world football governing body, FIFA. 
According to SAFA website, the Arbitrator is arguing that the PSLâ€™s Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) does not have jurisdiction over the issue after the board had allowed the player to continue playing. 
Orlando Pirates and Polokwane City had lodged a protest with the PSL arguing that Ajax Cape Town had contravened FIFA rules by fielding the player. Ndoro played for Pirates then signed for a Saudi Arabia side Al Faisaly before returning to the PSL to join Ajax. 
FIFA rules prohibit a player to play for three different clubs in a single season. 
In his ruling on Wednesday, 28 March 2018, Cassim SC referred the case to FIFA saying it was because the matter involved an overseas/international club.
