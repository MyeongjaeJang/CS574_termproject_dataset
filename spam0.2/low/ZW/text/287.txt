Zipra renews bid to recover seized properties   Former Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (Zipra) liberation struggle fighters are making frantic efforts to recover property worth millions of dollars seized by ex-president Robert Mugabe's regime during the Gukurahundi campaign of the 1980s that left an estimated 20 000 people dead in the Midlands and Matabeleland provinces. The mass killings, described as a genocide by international organisation Genocide Watch, remain a thorny issue in the country that incumbent President Emmerson Mnangagwa continues to grapple with, more than 30 years on. Nitram Investment Holdings, an investment vehicle owned by Zipra veterans, said the freedom fighters are seeking Mnangagwa's attention to push for the return of their properties confiscated by government. Mugabe was ousted in a military coup last November. - Zim Ind
