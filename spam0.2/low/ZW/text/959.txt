Dembare ready for Bosso: Mutasa 
Soccer24 on 1 Apr, 2018 
Dynamos coach Lloyd Mutasa believes his team is ready to face rivals Highlanders at Rufaro Stadium tomorrow. 
Dembare have only picked one point in their first three matches of the season, and the gaffer thinks they can come out with a positive result from the tie. 
“We are ready for Highlanders, the boys are hungry for a positive result,” Mutasa told The Sunday Mail. 
“After a slow start, we intend to turn the corner on Monday against a strong opposition.” 
The Glamour Boys lost 1-0 to Ngezi Platinum on Thursday after surrendering a 3-goal advantage to Shabanie Mine to settle for a draw on Match-day 2. Their opening fixture ended in a defeat in the hands of Chicken Inn. 
On the other hand, Bosso are yet to lose in this campaign with two wins and one draw. 
The match kicks-off at 3 pm. Share this:
