High Court judge Justice Alpheus Chitakunye declined to grant the Zimbabwe Anti-corruption Commission (Zacc) an order to search the University of Zimbabwe (UZ)’s offices with a view to seize documents and information pertaining to former First Lady Grace Mugabe’s PhD degree after the tertiary institution’s registrar, Noah Ariel Mutongoreni, approached the High Court challenging the warrant. 
This is the second time the High Court has declined Zacc a warrant of search and seizure. Justice Chitakunye also ordered Zacc and its investigating officer Detective Sergeant Richard Machinya to pay the costs incurred by UZ in filing the opposing application. Zacc had obtained a second warrant of search and seizure after the first one was nullified by Justice Lavender Makoni on February 16. However, Justice Chitakunye said the second warrant was null and void after UZ registrar Mutongoreni approached the High Court seeking an order declaring the new warrant of search and seizure null and void, arguing it had been illegally obtained.
