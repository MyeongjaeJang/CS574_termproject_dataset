Former Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel was left unconscious and swallowed his tongue during Slovakia’s King’s Cup final victory against Thailand on Sunday. 
Skrtel was knocked out in the 27th minute when the ball hit him in the face prompting him to collapse. The 33-year-old was incredibly saved by his team-mate Ondrej Duda, who acted quickly after realising the severity of the incident. 
According to Daily Mail , a UK newspaper, there was a long break in play and Skrtel was taken off the pitch before managing to return to the action and play for another 45 minutes. 
It was reported after the game that the Fenerbahce star was okay after a follow-up check from the Slovakia team doctor. 
Slovakia went on to beat Thailand 3-2 in the King’s Cup final.
