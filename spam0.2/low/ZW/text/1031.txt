Mberengwa to get citrus plantation Published: 02 April 2018 GOVERNMENT is in the process of establishing a citrus plantation at Manyuchi Dam in Mberengwa as one of the anchor projects aimed at producing export quality horticultural products, a senior Government official has said.Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement Deputy Minister, Davis Marapira, on Tuesday said Government was eyeing the European horticulture market and would want to restore its status as an agrarian-based economy.Marapira said Government was now prioritising horticulture as there was growing demand for horticultural and floricultural products in Europe.He said Government had embarked on a citrus plants project and would be putting up plantations across the country."We are establishing citrus plantations across the country," said Marapira. "In Midlands, we have identified Manyuchi Dam at the border of Mberengwa and Mwenezi where we want to put a citrus plantation. We are now shifting our focus to horticulture."We want to put avocado plantations, macadamia nuts, oranges, fibreless mangoes and lemons among other fruits. There is growing demand of these products in Europe."Marapira said Government was going to prepare 1 000 hectares that would be used for flower production in Mazowe.He said Government was aiming at producing horticultural products and fruits such as macadamia nuts, avocados, lemons, oranges, fibreless mangoes for the European market."We envisage a scenario where horticulture becomes the best foreign currency earner ahead of tobacco," said Marapira. "We want to utilise our water bodies in the forthcoming winter cropping season."All this is in our two year agricultural plan. In this plan we intend to put 300 000 ha under irrigation. What we want to impart to our farmers and people in general is the need to start harvesting water."Marapira said Government was in the process of equipping the irrigation schemes with centre pivots and other mechanisation equipment to maximise production during the winter cropping season."As was announced before, we received 80 centre pivots from Spain and we are expecting 50 more before the winter cropping season," he said."We have started distributing and installing those that we received." - chronicle
