Zimbabwean singing sensation Ammara Brown is set to perform in Lusaka, Zambia at the Big10UP show on the 30 th of March 2018. 
Mr Eazi, the ‘Leg Over’ hitmaker and South Africa’s Distruction Boyz are also headlining the event with many other supporting acts including Mampi, Bryan K also billed to perform at the same event. 
The show is hosted by Amigos Events and from the response it is getting online it is likely going to be packed. 
It’s nice to see our Home girl now also sharing the stage with other huge African artists. 
The show is taking place at the Queensmead Ground opposite JCS.
