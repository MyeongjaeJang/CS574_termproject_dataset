Chifambausiku sa Manyka you have hit the nail on the head- this tribal cabal is not going anywhere. We have a 93 year old dictator who wrecked our economy allocated ,himself 31 farms in contravention of his own government policies. His step-son summed it up '"we are Zimbabwe"that era will not come back. The President pronounced himself in from of former and current heads of states at his inaugration- "they no holy cows" -the people voice is the voice of God" ZIPRA forces died in Zvimba to liberate the Fatherland. Theÿ came from all language groups. The People of Zvimba supported the cause to free Zimbabwe and took no account dialects Manyika, Karanga or Zezuru. Muntihiri project is failed still born. Even MDC is losing support in Zvimba because Chamisa in his immaturity thinks he came climb to power on the back of a 93 old! Well done va Mutasa you are royalty! Mufaro Sibanda - 22 March 2018
