Ipec enforces new actuarial rules Published: 21 March 2018 The Insurance and Pensions Commission (Ipec) has issued a stern warning saying all insurance companies should engage actuaries for key validation on their activities or face serious consequences. The development comes at a time when some insurance companies and pension funds are said to be snubbing actuarial services due to high fees. It is understood that actuaries charges range from $20 per hour for a junior analyst coming straight from university to more than $300 per hour for a consultant with more than 15 years work experience and appointed or statutory or actuarial function holders. - Daily News
