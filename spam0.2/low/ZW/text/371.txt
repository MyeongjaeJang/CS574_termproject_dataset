Mhlangaâ€™s contract dispute far from over 
Soccer24 on 24 Mar, 2018 
Warriors defender Lawrence Mhlanga will have to wait even longer before he puts on an FC Platinum jersey in the league after Premier Soccer League asked his status clarified first. 
In a letter addressed to the Zifa Chief Executive, the Premier Soccer League said it will not allow a player to participate in the league without either a clearance from his previous club or a clearance from the Zifa players status committee. 
The PSL also said they are of the opinion that Zifa cannot clear any player without the verdict of the players status committee. 
Mhlanga spent the whole of 2017 without playing after Chicken Inn claimed FC Platinum negotiated with the player in bad faith as they still had a running contract with them. 
Meanwhile, some of the players whose status need ratification are Young Warriors striker Delic Murimba who moved to Triangle from Hwange and Moses Demera who has moved to ZPC Kariba from Yadah. Share this:
