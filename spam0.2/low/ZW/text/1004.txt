Sibanda names Mighty Warriors squad for Namibia clash 
  
Sithethelelwe Sibanda has named an 18-member Mighty Warriors squad for the AWCN first round qualifier against Namibia on 5 April. 
The squad is dominated by experienced players who have been playing together for a long time. 
The returning trio of Emmaculate Msipa, Mavis Chirandu and Felistas Muzongondi all made the team, having missed the previous major tournament due to work commitments. 
Rutendo Makore has to pass a late fitness test on 2 April if she is to take part in the back to back qualifiers, having suffered an ankle injury which saw her missing Sporting Club Huelva’s Liga Feminina victory on 1 April. 
Maudy Mafuruse returns for contention to lead the line following her six-month trial stint in Iceland in 2017. She will be competing for a place upfront with Susan Nyama, Vimbai Mharadzi and Erina Jeke. 
At the back, the only fairly new name is Edline Mutumbami, among mainstays – Nobuhle Majika, Sheila Makoto, Nobukhosi Ncube and Lynett Mutokuto. 
The return leg will be played at Rufaro Stadium on 8 April.
