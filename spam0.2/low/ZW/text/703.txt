Arsenal forward Reiss Nelson is among the best 50 NxGn teenagers in 2018. 
NxGn is a list of teenage players in the world who have excelled in the past year. It’s compiled by Goal! , an international football website. 
The 19-year-old who is eligible to play for Zimbabwe is ranked among other talented youngsters like Patrick Kluivert’s son Justin, AC Milan goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, Liverpool’s Ben Woodburn and Timothy Weah, the son of 1995 Ballon d’ Or winner George. 
Kluivert is the winner of this year’s award, beating Donnarumma who won it last year. 
The website described Nelson as a turbo-charged winger with mesmerising dribbling skills. 
The ZIFA target has already broken into Arsene Wenger’s first-team squad, impressing in the Community Shield win over Chelsea at the start of the season before making his first appearances in the Europa League, League Cup, FA Cup and then, in January, the Premier League. 
He recently scored a brace for England Under 19s against Hungary. 
With this massive recognition, it remains unknown if ZIFA will manage to convince him to play for the Warriors. Share this:
