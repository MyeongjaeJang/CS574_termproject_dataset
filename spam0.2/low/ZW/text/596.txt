Soccer24 on 27 Mar, 2018 
Chicken Inn midfielder Innocent Mucheneka has reportedly attracted interest from ABSA Premiership side Martizburg United. 
Muchaneka’s agent Gibson Mahachi confirmed to The Herald that the player is undergoing trials at the South African club. 
“Yes for Innocent that is true he is undergoing trials with them (Maritzburg), he started training with them last week and we are still to hear if they are interested or not. 
“It was an international break so the coaches there might have more time to assess him other than when they are busy with their league match preparations. 
“The transfer window there is closed for now and the players they want might be moving in June not now,” said Mahachi. 
Meanwhile, the newspaper also reported that goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze has signed a three-year contract with Limpopo-based Baroka FC. The 28-year old goal-minder will join Baroka in June ahead of the 2018-2019 South African season and has been allowed to continue featuring for Chicken Inn until he completes his move. Share this:
