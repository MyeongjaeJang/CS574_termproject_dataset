UNIVERSITY of Zimbabwe vice-chancellor Levi Nyagura wants his trial in connection with former first lady Grace Mugabe’s controversial PhD quashed. 
CHARLES LAITON 
Nyagura, who was arrested last month, said Harare magistrate Tilda Mazhande’s ruling two weeks ago that he must stand trial should be set aside. 
“I am asking this court to exercise its review powers because the first respondent adopted a grossly irregular procedure in determining whether my arrest was lawful and there was reasonable suspicion warranting my lawful placement on remand,” he wrote in his affidavit filed at the High Court. 
“The first respondent’s plainly premature ruling seriously violates my constitutional rights as guaranteed in Section 49 (1) (b) and 50 (1) (e) of the constitution.” Nyagura also accused Mazhande of refusing to hear evidence from the investigating officer. 
Mazhande and the state are yet to respond to the application.
