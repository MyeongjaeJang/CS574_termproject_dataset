Last Wednesday Sunday Chidzambwa’s men fell to hosts Zambia 5-4 on penalties as the two teams proved inseparable having played out a 2-2 draw in the first match of the tournament. 
CAPS United’s Praise Tonha and South Africa-based Ovidy Karuru both converted their spot kicks, while Tinotenda Kadewere, who plies his trade in Sweden, and English League One club Bradford City’s Adam Chicksen had their spot kicks saved. 
Carmo Carlos, Quissanga Bartolomew, Afonso Manuel and EStevao Ricardo were on target for Angola with Daniel Macuenho missing the target. 
Strangely, similar to the midweek match, the Warriors surrendered the lead twice in regulation time with Angola grabbing a late equaliser. 
Abbas Amidu gave the Warriors the lead in the 22nd minute with Campos Djalma drawing Angola level a minute before half-time. 
Talent Chawapiwa restored Zimbabwe’s lead seven minutes after half-time, but Angola grabbed a last-minute equaliser to deny the Warriors bronze.
