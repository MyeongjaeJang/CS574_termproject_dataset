Said Mnangagwa: 
Civil society, who come with an agenda, especially in the area of elections, they assemble a team of what they call experts coming from various countries and come and say we want to teach your people about voter education, they then come with gifts like beans and when you open the beans (sic) you find a paper inside which tells you whom to vote for. Such type of civil society is not necessary we don’t need it. If they interfere in the politics of a country, that’s not acceptable and also the issue comes in on who is funding them has an agenda if one has a funder who wants to address issues of poverty, provision of clean water that is acceptable, but to say a particular party, say in Nigeria, has stayed in power for too long and it must go in terms of their understanding of democracy from wherever they come from, it is necessary to have 10 or 15 parties forming a government, let them form those governments where they come from. If in a country there are few political parties and the one that wins the majority and is allowed to form a government let it be, in our view it shouldn’t anger them (sic)
