Ndoro’s saga to be finalised tomorrow 
Soccer24 on 27 Mar, 2018 
A decision is expected on Wednesday in the arbitration case between the Premier Soccer League (PSL) and its own Dispute Resolution Chamber as the long running saga over Ajax Cape Town striker Tendai Ndoro looks to be coming to an end. 
The DRC had announced in January that Ndoro could be fielded for Ajax despite a FIFA edict to the contrary and their decision was quickly appealed by the PSL. 
According to Times Live , a South African news website, the arbitrator‚ Advocate Nassir Cassim SC‚ reserved judgment after a hearing in Johannesburg on Monday where the PSL is appealing a decision by the DRC to allow Ajax to field Tendai Ndoro‚ in spite of a FIFA ruling that says no player can play for three different teams in a single season. 
Ajax won the other part of the Ndoro legal saga last week when the protest brought against them by Orlando Pirates and Polokwane City were dismissed. 
Pirates protested against Ajax’s use of Ndoro when the two clubs met at the Cape Town Stadium on January 31 and Ajax won 3-0. City did the same when they took on Ajax‚ with Ndoro in the line-up‚ in a drawn match on February 4. Share this:
