The Zimbabwe International Film Festival(ZIFF) and the Images International Film Festival(IIFF) have teamed up to host a Joint Film Festival this year (2018). This is a welcome development for the Zimbabwean film industry, which looks like its on a resurgence. 
The two festivals do not have a name for the joint festival yet and they need you your help. 
Below is information on how you can get involved and stand a chance to win a price: 
What’s in a name? (a fantastic prize – that’s what!!) 
The International Images Film Festival for Women (IIFF) and the Zimbabwe International Film Festival (ZIFF) are teaming up again to present the 2018 edition of the Joint Film Festival. 
We are currently looking for a catchy, home-grown, new name for this joint festival and in line with our rich African heritage of naming traditions, we are inviting YOU to help us, just as relatives are called upon to name a new member of the family. 
What kind of name are we looking for? The name must be short and conscise, can be in any official Zimbabwean language, must relate to or reflect film and cinema, and due to the fact that one of the organisations in this partnership is a women’s organisation, it must be gender-sensitive. 
All you have to do is post your suggestion preceeded by the hashtag # IgamaZita and tag @wfozicapa and @zifftweets on either Facebook or Twitter before 4pm on Sunday 25 March 2018. 
The best name will be selected by a jury, comprising members of the two film institutions, IIFF and ZIFFT. 
The originator of the chosen name will receive VIP treatment throughout the festival, and also get a fantastic prize (to be revealed at the festival awards ceremony) …and of course, he or she will have a LASTING LEGACY of “The One who Named THE Festival”
