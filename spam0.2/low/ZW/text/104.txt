PRAZ sets up probe team Published: 21 March 2018 THE Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (PRAZ) has set up a department to investigate the awarding of tenders following the decentralisation of tender allocation systems.PRAZ was established in January this year, taking over from the dissolved State Procurement Board (SPB) whose operations were plagued by accusations of illicit tender dealings.Responding to emailed questions, PRAZ board chairperson, Mrs Vimbai Nyemba, said her organisation has decentralised its operations and that procuring institutions will now handle their tender allocations.This comes as a relief for local companies who previously complained that the centralisation of the tender system was disadvantaging them."The cry for decentralisation emanated from the fact that there was one central body, the SPB, making decisions in Harare for the whole country. That process included the termination of tenders at the SPB Harare office."It's now a thing of the past, tenders are now terminating at procuring entities that are in different regions of the country," said Mrs Nyemba.She said for accountability purposes, PRAZ has set up an investigations team that will monitor the awarding of tenders."The role of investigation was always the responsibility of the SPB that PRAZ also has. PRAZ has established a Monitoring and Evaluation Department endowed with investigations in addition to monitoring and evaluation," said Mrs Nyemba.The composition of the SPB compromised its operations as it was heavily involved in the allocation of tenders."The board chair said PRAZ will adhere to principles of good governance as reiterated by President Emmerson Mnangagwa whose administration has declare war on corruption."His Excellency the President is clear on fighting corruption and this gives the impetus to the authority to manage corruption in public procurement."The Act is also regulating the whole procurement cycle from procurement planning through tendering and contract award, contract management and assets disposal.There are rules for each stage of the process now making it clear on issues of guidance, compliance and enforcement," she said.Mrs Nyemba said her board will address issues of tender middlemen who were previously used as fronts leading to major problems."The law requires fair, equal and equitable treatment of bidders. It also stresses the parameters for specifying supplier credentials and requirement specification."The focus of PRAZ is to build capacity so that procurement processes are conducted efficiently in a transparent manner. The State Procurement Board Reform project is currently seized with that project and it shall be rolled shortly," said Mrs Nyemba. - zimpapers
