Harare to re-advertise town clerk's post Published: 24 hours ago HARARE City Council has resolved to re-advertise the town clerk's post, after its three shortlisted candidates were rejected by the Local Government Board (LGB) for various reasons.The resolution was made during a full council meeting last night after mayor Bernard Manyenyeni told councillors that the LGB was not happy with the selection process and requested that the position be re-advertised.Councillors agreed to invite fresh applications while a legal opinion would be sought to challenge the LGB decision."From the deliberations here, I get a sense that we shall re-advertise the post while we seek the legal challenge," Manyenyeni said.His deputy, Enock Mupamawonde had told the meeting that council should challenge the LGB position on this issue after efforts to engage Local Government minister July Moyo failed to break the impasse.Council had submitted three names to the LGB for consideration. These were the city's suspended human capital director Cainos Chingombe, MDC-T Hatfield legislator Tapiwa Mashakada and Gweru town clerk Elizabeth Gwatipedza.Manyenyeni recently disclosed that Chingombe's candidature was turned down over his alleged involvement in the council executives' "obscene" salary scandal while Mashakada could not make it because of his active involvement in the opposition MDC-T politics. Gwatipedza was also rejected for demanding $38 000 worth of curtains at her council-issued house in Gweru.The position has been lying vacant for three years after former town clerk Tendai Mahachi was retrenched.Two years ago, council appointed former banker James Mushore to the position, but former Local Government minister Saviour Kasukuwere nullified the decision, accusing council of flouting the appointment procedures. Mushore has since approached the Labour Court for recourse and the matter is yet to be determined. - zimpapers
