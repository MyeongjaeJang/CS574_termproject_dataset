Langalakhe Mabhena One man’s meat is another man’s poison! 
Njabulo Nkomo, known in music circles as Tytan Skhokho of the Skhokho Empire married social media celebrity Olinda Chapel last week. 
Their relationship blossomed for all to see on social media as somewhat a reality television show. 
From the time Tytan moved into Chapel’s life wiping away her tears from her previous highly publicised and drama filled marriage to rapper Desmond Chideme alias Stunner- the world was watching. 
Endless data bundles were wasted or used wisely on Olinda’s soap opera and from the look of things, with a fresh lovey dovey story line, people will continue following the United Kingdom-based Olinda. 
To show public interest in Olinda and Tytan’s marriage, the latter posted that he is the man in her life and the post garnered more than 750 likes on Facebook. 
“Oksalayo umuntu ngowami (The fact is she’s mine),” posted Tytan. 
Olinda’ story of finding love after a heartbreak serves as an inspiration to some women. 
“I am so happy for her. Everyone deserves to be loved and Tytan is not just her husband. He’s our hero because he is a man who found love where others abused. Some thought he was just there for the good time but guess what, his heart is in it,” said Sihle Nzima from Bulawayo. 
During her time with Stunner, Olinda told of how she sacrificed her looks to meet his standards because he didn’t want to be the guy with the “fat girl” in the club. 
However, with the new dispensation in her life she is taking the fuller figure with pride. 
“One dhafu rakarongeka, nekufuta kwangu ndiri kungo rarama kamwe ka life so (One fat girl on point, with my full figure I am very much living life to the fullest),” she said on her facebook wall. 
All the best to Tytan and Olinda.
