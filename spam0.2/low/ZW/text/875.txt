Triangle hold Bosso as Shabanie, Nichrut share spoils 
Soccer24 on 30 Mar, 2018 
Highlanders dropped points for the first time this season when they drew 0-0 against Triangle United in a match played at Barbourfields Stadium on Friday afternoon. 
The Bulawayo Giants have themselves to blame after failing to score in a game they dominated and created several chances. Ozias Zibande was the chief suspect, especially in the first half. 
The striker skied his first effort inside the opening quarter hour before he wasted another great opportunity on the 20th-minute mark. United only came close after 35 minutes when they got a free-kick on the edge of the box which was saved by the keeper. 
A minute later, Zibande again had a chance, but this time his on-target strike was cleared off the line by the goalkeeper. 
The second half saw both teams missing from good positions. Nothing changed and the game ended in a goalless draw with Triangle picking their first point of the campaign. 
At Maglas, Nichrut came from behind twice and squeeze a 2-2 draw against Shabanie Mine. 
Richard Kawondera opened the scoring as early as in the 6th minute before Nichrut’s Nigel Mupinduki equalised a minute into the second period. In-form striker David Temwanjira netted his fourth goal of the season to restore the Chinda Boys’ lead. 
With only four minutes to play, Farai Vimisayi struck home to earn his team a crucial away point to remain unbeaten in their debut season.
