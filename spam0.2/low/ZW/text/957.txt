England-based defender Adam Chicksen says he can’t wait to feature for the Warriors in front of the home fans in the near future. 
The 26-year-old Bradford City player made his National Team debut last month in the Four-Nation tournament hosted in Zambia. 
In an interview with The Standard , Chicksen said he is now looking forward to showcasing his talent on home soil. 
“The one thing I’m itching to do now is to play in front of the fans at home and hopefully we can give them a Warrior-like performance they deserve,” he said. 
“I’m sure the fans will be there in their numbers, supporting as they were for this tournament. I thought how we played as a team we set out to go for our opponents — I enjoy that. 
“I’m a very driven, hungry, passionate person that only works for the team, not as an individual. And will never stop trying to improve myself and the people around me. I love this sport and hopefully can entertain the fans, but also show I will give everything all the time,” he added. 
Alec Mudimu, Marshall Munetsi, Cliff Moyo and Butholezwe Ncube also featured for the Warriors for the first time. Share this:
