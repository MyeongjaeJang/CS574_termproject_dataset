FCP bank on Champions League experience 
Soccer24 on 24 Mar, 2018 
FC Platinum acting coach Lizwe Sweswe says they will use the experienced gained during their short spell in the CAF Champions League to defend their Castle Lager Premier Soccer League title. 
The Zvishavane side is set to play their first match of the season this afternoon after their encounter against ZPC Kariba failed to take place. They face Yadah at Mandava Stadium. 
“We can say this is our first game, but remember we have been competing in the Champions League, and I believe the experience we got from the African safari will help us on the local front,” Sweswe told NewsDay. 
“Our target is to win the league title again, and from the assessment, I think we are ready to defend what is ours, but we will take each game as it comes. I am also glad that new players the likes of Farai Mupasiri are doing well with the rest of the team.” 
Meanwhile, two highly-rated foreign strikers, Cameroonian Albert Eonde and Zambian Shadreck Mayembe are expected to get their league debut today. Share this:
