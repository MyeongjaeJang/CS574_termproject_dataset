“That report; I am sure the minister of Finance and Economic Development will be able to publish.

“As regards to the local authorities, they are not an exception to this problem that is being faced by many of our people in the society,”

“ 
“Therefore, we expect that, value despite the dollarisation, will be looked at in line with the recommendations of the Committee that was set up by the minister of Finance and Economic Development once the publications are made public,” 
He further said: “ 
“It will also show that while they deduct the salaries of the workers so that they can send that money to the Local Authority Pension Fund that is not happening.
