Mutasa rejects Mugabe's offer Published: 22 March 2018 Former minister of State Security Didymus Mutasa has turned down an invitation to join the newly-formed National Patriotic Front (NPF), saying it is nothing but a tribal party doing the bidding for deposed ex-president, Robert Mugabe. A former close ally of Mugabe, the country's first black Speaker of Parliament yesterday said he would rather stay in retirement than join the NPF because it was no different from Zanu-PF. Mutasa, 82, had a private meeting with NPF leader, retired brigadier-general Ambrose Mutinhiri at his residence in Harare, sending the rumour mill into overdrive amid speculation that the former Marondera West legislator had convinced him to join the new political formation. - Daily News
