Police brutality victim demands $33 000 Published: 22 March 2018 A VICTIM of police brutality has taken the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) to the High Court demanding $33 000 compensation, after a police officer allegedly unleashed a dog on him during a musical show by Oliver Mtukudzi in Gokwe last year.The victim, Oren Rukwava, cited Home Affairs minister, Obert Mpofu Police Commissioner-General Godwin Matanga and the police dog handler Fazibo Nkosana as respondents.In his declaration to the High Court, Rukwava said Nkosana released the dog with an instruction to attack him for no apparent reason."The instruction given by Nkosana to the dog onto the plaintiff was unwarranted, unjustified, cruel and unprofessional. The plaintiff suffered injuries, pain, shock and suffering and the attack resulted in a lot of embarrassment," the summon reads."The plaintiff was unable to drive his vehicle and had to hire a driver until his recovery. The first and second respondents are vicariously liable for the damages incurred as they are the employers of the third defendant."However, the Civil Division of the Attorney General's Office representing the respondents filed an appearance to defend, saying the dog was agitated when Rukwava pushed Nkosana."The defendants did not release the dog to the plaintiff, but that the dog was agitated by the conduct of the plaintiff as he resisted arrest by pushing Nkosana away despite the fact that he had already arrested him," the plea read.But in his letter of demand, Rukwava said Nkosana had approached him and his friends while they were merrymaking at the musical show and he had no reason to release the dog.Rukwava further argued he was never arrested and there was no proof that he was arrested and charged. - newsday
