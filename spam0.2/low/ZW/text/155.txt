Popular music video director Vusa Blaqs says he is losing clients after an audio of him attacking film producer leaked. In a two-minute audio, Vusa is heard using cussing words to ridicule award winning film producer, Amanda Ranganawa who has earlier written an article in the NewsDay highlighting sexual harassment in the Zimbabwe Film Industry. 
Vusa who has produced music videos for some of the biggest names in the country including Ammara’s Akiliz music video is facing backlash from the audio. 
According to Vusa, the director started receiving e-mails in the morning from some of his clients informing him that they had terminated their contracts with him. 
Here Vusa’s full statement below. 
I’ve lost everything. Lesson learned. While attempting to be cool on a group I actually dug my own grave. My comments about a sad thing that happened to Amanda have sparked so much outrage that it has actually affected my livelihood. My own actions have put an abrupt end to my career which I worked so hard to established. All morning I’ve been receiving emails from clients cancelling contracts. Yes it’s that bad. I have myself to blame. Still I say thank you to my sisters Bren Mupa and Sisa Senkosiand all of you who have spoken out against my disgraceful actions. Once again I hope other men who are perpetrating this violence will learn from my mistakes. And I hereby add my voice to the campaign against sexual harassment. Thank you for reprimanding me. #ThePrime has fallen
