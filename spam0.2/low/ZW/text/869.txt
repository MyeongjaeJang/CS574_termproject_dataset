ONE of the leading body building academies in the country, Body Works Gym is sending three athletes to Novice Zimbabwe at the Zimbabwe College of Music in Harare on Saturday . 
Two females, Kylie MacDonald, Sinini Nxumalo and one male Jonathan Fredericks will be representing Body Works Gym as well as Bulawayo in a competition meant for those who have never taken part in a national event. Nxumalo and MacDonald are competing in the beach bikini while Fredericks is entering the men’s Under-21. 
Body Works Gym manager Donavan Ashborne said they were expecting medals from the three athletes heading to Harare since the trio has put in a lot of hard work in the gym. 
“From the three we are sending to Harare this week we are hoping for medals from all of them, they have really put in a lot of hard work and I think this year we are bringing back the Ms Novice title,’’ Ashborne said. 
Last year, Body Works Gym sent 10 competitors to Mr and Ms Novice with some of those who did well being Thembinkosi Lunga who finished second in senior men, Marvelous Gandah the winner in the men’s physique where Tapiwa Zimhamba was second. Loreen Moyo took second place in the women’s beach bikini fitness where Eulene Ndlovu was third and Khethiwe Ncube fourth. 
Ashborne is travelling to Harare with the athletes and their coach Simon Ghama.
