fifteen-year-old Audrey Anesu Ngangura’s dream was to become a magistrate. Despite dropping out of school after writing Grade Seven examinations, in which she did exceptionally well — coming out with five units — Ngangura hopes one day she will go back to school and realise her dream.

She is among many girls in Uzumba Maramba Pfungwe (UMP) district in Mashonaland East undergoing a unique programme designed to empower adolescent girls. 
The Sista2Sista programme has touched the lives of over 100 000 girls in rural Zimbabwe through mentorship. The Sista2Sista club offers a safe place where vulnerable adolescent girls can speak with mentors and each other about their problems. 
Girls in the club learn about sexual and reproductive health and rights, financial literacy, and how to navigate difficult social situations, including coercive relationships. The programme also aims to give girls the confidence and self-esteem to stand up for themselves. 
“At one point in my life, I decided to get married to my 18-year-old boyfriend,” said Ngangura in an interview with The Standard Style on the sidelines of a Sista2Sista session at Chitimbe Health Centre in Musosonwa ward, Uzumba, last week. 
“I lost my parents when I was very young and I was left under the custody of my uncle and grandmother who are both unemployed. After Grade 7, they told me that they could no longer afford sending me to secondary school. “My dreams were shattered because I was looking forward to be a magistrate. I thought of getting married, but after joining the Sista2Sista programme, I thought otherwise and I want to go back to school.” 
Ngangura, who during the Sista2Sista session proved to be the most intelligent, said the programme had an enormous impact on her life. 
“I have learnt a lot of things, including that early marriages are wrong. They are wrong in the sense they breed gender-based violence, something that I have seen happening to my two sisters, both of whom were married under the age of 16,” she said. 
“Apart from early marriages, we also do sessions on sexual and reproductive health as well as HIV and Aids.” 
Sista2Sista mentor at Chitimbe Health Centre Lydia Muchena said the programme helps girls to socialise with their peers and learn from others about how to defend their sexual reproductive health rights. 
“Girls learn a lot of things under the Sista2Sista programme, with the main emphasis being helping girls navigate difficult social situations. A lot of girls who have gone through this programme are doing well and the mind-set of the community has changed,” she said. 
UMP, one of the marginalised communities in the country, is characterised by rampant child marriages, but Zimbabwe Community Health Intervention Research (ZICHIRe) programmes officer for the district Aundrance Machakamise believes the Sista2Sista initiative, a joint UNFPA-ZICHIRe project, is changing the mindset of the community with regard to child marriages. 
“You know UMP is one of the communities in the country where child marriage prevalence is high. We have realised that this programme has been effective as we are now seeing child marriage cases going down,” she said. 
“We have also seen a number of members of the Johanne Marange Apostle sect embracing our programme as evidenced by the increasing number of girls from the church who are now part of this Sista2Sista family. It’s really appreciated.” 
National Aids Council (NAC) district coordinator for UMP Owen Mupemhi said programmes such as Sista2Sita, were going a long way in the response to HIV and Aids. 
“You will realise that we are one of the districts that have seen a reduction in HIV prevalence in the country, thanks to the intervention programmes that are taking place across the district,” he said. 
“It is pleasing to note that UMP as a district with a high prevalence rate of child marriage, 30% to be precise, has embraced such programmes. Our programmes include sensitising communities and engaging community leaders discussing issues like child marriage as well as HIV and Aids.” 
Approximately one in three girls in Zimbabwe are married before their 18th birthday. 
Child marriage predominantly affects girls who live in poverty and in rural areas. Girls from the poorest 20% of households are more than four times as likely to be married/in union before age 18 than girls from the richest 20% of households. The less educated a girl is, the more she is likely to marry during her childhood. 
Mupemhi said some of the intervention programmes were targeted at religious groups.
