AS Vita are reportedly demanding $70 000 from Oscar Machapa in order to give him a reverse international clearance. 
According to The Herald , Machapa still has a running contract with the Congolese Giants but decided to return home, claiming his security was not assured in Kinshasa. He was included in Lloyd Chitembwe’s team, replacing captain Hardlife Zvirekwi who was injured in a car accident. 
“The team he (Machapa) was playing for in the DRC, AS Vita Club, didn’t release him but he instead returned home as he claimed he feared for his life,’’ unnamed sources told the newspaper. 
“He decided to settle for CAPS United as he thought it would be easy to get the reverse international clearance. 
“But, the club (AS Vita) is now demanding $70 000 which CAPS United are not in a position to pay. 
“As it stands, Machapa will not feature for CAPS as getting the clearance is not that simple as things stand.’’ 
The Green Machine signed a good number of players who include Simba Nhivi, Method Mwanjali, Milton Ncube and Machapa, most of whom were free agents. Mwanjali is also waiting for his clearance but is expected to get it soon from his old club Simba of Tanzania after his contract was terminated. Share this:
