Mnangagwa threatens corrupt elements Published: 30 March 2018 PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa has threatened to deal with corrupt elements in public entities, including Zesa Holdings.Mnangagwa made the remarks while commissioning two new power generation units at Kariba South Power Station on Wednesday."My administration will be 'blind' and not consider the personalities that commit acts of corruption," he said."Corruption at whatever level, by whosoever, will not be tolerated and perpetrators will be punished."Mnangagwa added: "Stealing and vandalism of any Zesa property or transmission lines in particular, is a criminal offence. We will not hesitate to bring the culprits to book and impose stiffer penalties to deter such retrogressive activities."Zesa and its subsidiary companies are currently under investigation for shady deals which have prejudiced the power utility of millions of dollars.African Parliamentarian Network Against Corruption (APNAC) chairperson and board member of the Pan African Network against Corruption, James Maridadi, however, challenged Mnangagwa to walk the talk on corruption and ensure those implicated are brought to book."The President can say that at a rally, but talk is cheap and money buys the whiskey. The entities and persons that are corrupt in Zimbabwe are known, but why is it taking long to prosecute? For example, the chairperson of the NSSA (National Social Security Authority) board Robbin Vela was recalled without even being asked to respond to any allegations of corruption. Recalling someone is not enough," Maridadi said.The Mabvuku-Tafara legislator said Mnangagwa has failed to deal with persons mentioned in the list of foreign currency externalisers.Maridadi said Mnangagwa will only be deemed serious in dealing with corruption if he gets those implicated investigated and arrested. - newsday
