The Confederation African Football (CAF) has opened its bureau in Mahajanga, a city northwest coast of Madagascar, with FIFA General Secretary Fatma Samoura, CAF Executive Committee members and several African football federation heads in attendance. 
The opening of the bureau is under the CAF Statutes, which means the establishment of an office for the CAF President in his home town if he resides outside the city where the CAF headquarters is located, is to make sure smooth coordination between the Secretariat in Cairo and the office of the CAF President. 
The CAF President was joined by Madagascar Senate President Rivo Rakotovao, leader of the National Assembly, Jean-Max Rakotomamonjy, Defense Minister Beni Xavier Rasolofonirina, Police Minister Mamy Andrianisa and other top government officials for the inauguration. 
He used the opportunity to offer a heartfelt gratitude to the presidents of the federations for voting for him to take charge of Africa football, assuring them that he will fight their interest. 
â€œYou all played pivotal roles in making this vision happen. Now in front of my family, my close friends and the people of Madagascar let me use this opportunity to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the trust that you have placed in me. Share this:
