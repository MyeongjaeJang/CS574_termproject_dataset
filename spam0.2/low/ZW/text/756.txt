Econet slams greedy agents Published: 22 hours ago Mobile telecommunication company Econet Wireless Zimbabwe has disowned agents who are charging punitive rates to the transacting public.A snap survey by The Herald in Mutare showed that some unscrupulous dealers were charging 30 percent interest to process transactions, especially those redeeming cash.Econet Mutare resident manager Mr Parshon Muranganwa said in a recent interview, the company had zero tolerance on corruption."I would like to be very clear on this matter: as Econet, we do not condone EcoCash agencies who are misusing the facility for personal aggrandisement by demanding ungazetted charges on cash withdrawals by our customers," said Mr Muranganwa."Moreso, I urge members of the public to report such misconduct to Econet once they fall prey and I would like to also assure members of the public that once a formal complaint has been lodged with us and is proved to be true, we do not hesitate to withdraw the agent line from the merchant."Again, inasmuch as we do not support the illegal charges, it is advisable for members of the public to embrace the cashless society and avoid the risk of being duped," he added.Most EcoCash customers are fretting over punitive charges, particularly for accessing cash.Said Mr Trymore Madodo (56) of Hobhouse, Mutare: "We are in a dilemma these days. EcoCash agents now have the money for cash-outs but the problem comes with the conditions under which you get the money; the interest rates are very high."Chipo Chibodo of Sakubva high-density suburb said the mobile money agents were doing more harm than good.Some people even speculate that some dealers are now using agents as conduits through which they buy and sell money. - zimpapers
