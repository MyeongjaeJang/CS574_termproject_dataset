ZIMBABWEANS must honour the elderly, as not doing so will bring a curse to the nation. This was part of the message from the latest book Double Honour Servants of God penned by prolific writer Pride Sibiya.

Speaking at the book launch held at Ablaze Church in Chitungwiza, Sibiya commended President Emmerson Mnangagwa for honouring former president Robert Mugabe, notwithstanding the differences the two might have. 
“We have elderly people among us, some of whom we have surrendered to old people’s homes like Bumhudzo and the like, those people are very close and dear to God. So, if we don’t honour them, a curse will come upon Zimbabwe,” he said. 
“It is very very important like what the president is doing to the former president, taking care of him: that is very critical in terms of honouring the elderly because the Bible says when you honour the elderly, you will have the blessing of longevity, you will have long life in marriage, long life in business and long life as a nation. 
“So, it is important for us to remember those who have gone before us. even if today we now view them as bad people, most of what we have today came through them.” 
The 122-page book says while the church is now saturated with fake prophets, the church should position itself for the blessing that flows from God to those who boldly “double honour the faithful servants of God”. 
Sibiya, who has written six books to date, ventured into church ministry in 1994. He said he had always had a passion for writing and the latest book was “a cry for God’s servants”.
