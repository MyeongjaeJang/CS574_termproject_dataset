Mubaiwa refuses Chiyangwa’s offer

Dynamos president and PSL chairman Keni Mubaiwa has refused to be appointed to the ZIFA executive board. 
Mubaiwa was roped in after two members – Piraishe Mabhena and Felton Kamambo resigned yesterday. 
In a letter sent to ZIFA, the Dembare boss said he is unable to take the post without a resolution from his PSL colleagues. 
However, Keni Mubaiwa said he will only consider the appointment if the PSL endorse him. 
Part of the letter reads: “Please be advised that I am unable to accept the co-option into the ZIFA Executive committee as a Board Member without a resolution from my fellow Premier Soccer League Board of Governors. 
However, I may consider the co-option into the ZIFA Executive Committee should the PSL Board of Governors agree to convene a Special Congress and unanimously resolve that I accept the appointment.” 
According to the ZIFA constitution, if more than 50% of the positions in the executive become vacant, the Secretary-General should take over the reigns while arranging for an elective congress to be held in short time. 
Mabhena and Kamambo’s resignation plus the post left vacant following the death of Edzai Kasinauyo, Chiyangwa must now step down and hand over the power to his secretary.
