Last year, the company won the best dealership award in vehicles sales and emerged as a runner-up in parts sales and a runner-up in the service category."What we do is we don't want to disclose our numbers so early in the year because of our competitors but we have agreements in place this year. This year, at UD Trucks we are looking at selling, including tractors, just over 100 vehicles and we have put in place strategies and tactics to achieve that. Our Q1 results are pleasing," he said.Towards the end of last year UD Trucks managed to secure a dealership for tractors with New Holland."These awards are acknowledgement of good work we have done for the last 12 months. It shows that although things are not well we are trying to push the Zimbabwe agenda to the world. We were awarded the best dealer of the year award in various special business units. One of our technicians, Michael Mupunga, was also honoured at the ceremony, as the Best Technician in South Africa. It's good that the awards also included South Africa. This translates to the kind of service we offer," he saidUD Trucks has a footprint in Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru and, Mutare.Every year UD holds an Annual Dealer Conference for all its dealers in Southern Africa.
