Dynamos’ supporters association chairperson Benjamin Munzira has warned some fans who have threatened to protest against the current administration led by Bernard Marriot . 
There are social media reports suggesting that some sections of supporters are planning to boycott all home matches starting with Sunday’s game against Shabanie Mine. 
In an open letter posted on Dynamos’ official Facebook page, Munzira urged his club’s faithfuls to shun from participating in these planned protests. He said anyone who have issues with the Club leadership should follow the right procedures and approach their respective Chapter Chairpersons. 
Here is the open latter by Benjamin Munzira: 
Whilst we appreciate the role we play as the Club’s supporters, it is my desire to to urge all of us to shun from participation in carrying out any of the threats and demonstrations that have been planned by some sections of our supporters. The protests are understood to be around issues to do with the Club administration. 
Our role as supporters remains that of giving maximum support to our beloved Club- moreso in these trying times. Let us all continue to assist the Club however we can- wherever possible. We would like to distance ourselves from those sections of supporters mobilizing mass protests against the Club management on social media. We would like to caution these individuals that if they are caught wanting, we will allow the law to take its course. 
Dynamos Football Club is a tight-knit family where hooliganism has no place. We urge everyone who deems to have any issues that need to heard by the Club leadership, to follow the set procedure and protocols; and approach their respective Chapter Chairpersons who will in turn liaise with the relevant club officials.
