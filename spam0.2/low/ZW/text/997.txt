I would have wanted Epoupa in squad: Mutasa 
Soccer24 on 2 Apr, 2018 
Dynamos coach Lloyd Mutasa says he would have wanted to see his star striker Christian Epoupa in the squad ahead of their league match against Highlanders at Rufaro Stadium this afternoon. 
Epoupa is refusing to play until he is paid at least half of the $16 000 owed to him by the Harare Giants. 
“It is games like these in which players can make a name for themselves. So, in as much as I would have wanted Epoupa to be available for selection, I also believe whoever is given the chance can go into the battle and show their worth,” Mutasa told The Herald. 
“Epoupa is a vital member of the squad, but then his unavailability is not a technical issue. That’s an administrative issue, and the players who are available will have to do duty for us.” 
The forward, who still has seven months left in his contract, is reportedly unhappy with the way the club has handled his financial situation with his manager Gilbert Sengwe saying the player now wants to terminate his contract and return home. Share this:
