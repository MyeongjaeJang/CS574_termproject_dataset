Mnangagwa names, shames looters Published: 20 March 2018 President Mnangagwa yesterday named and shamed corporates and individuals that failed to return nearly $1 billion they externalised in the past years, despite Government giving them a three-month amnesty.The moratorium, which began on December 1 last year, expired last Friday.This saw President Mnangagwa publishing a list with 1 844 externalisers and most of the looters are in mining, agriculture, manufacturing and cross border freight.From $1,4 billion that was externalised, $591,1 million was recovered under the amnesty, while $826,5 million is outstanding.The money was looted through non-repatriation of export proceeds, payment of imports not received in Zimbabwe and funds banked in foreign banks in cash or under spurious circumstances. - the herald
