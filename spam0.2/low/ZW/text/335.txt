CHIREDZI - MISA-Zimbabwe has sent an alert at which four journalists were this week assaulted outside the Chiredzi Magistrates' Court at the end of Andrew Takashinga Bere's bail hearing. 
Bere is accused of defrauding United States of America taxpayer funds amounting to $7 million during his stay in the country. 
The four journalists harassed are Godfrey Mtimba a freelance journalist, Patrick Chitongo of Chiredzi’s Flame newspaper, Morris Bishi of the Masvingo Mirror, and Tawanda Mangoma with Zimpapers in Chiredzi. The journalists were assaulted when they attempted to take pictures of Bere as he was led out of court. 
The alleged perpetrators of the assault are family members from Bere’s family. 
Misa Zimbabwe reiterates its position that media freedom, freedom of expression and access to information are the cornerstones of the practice of journalism. These rights are constitutionally guaranteed and must be respected.
