Bulawayo's investment drive hailed   Vice President Kembo Mohadi has commended Bulawayo for taking a lead in engaging investors from South Africa in its investment drive as this resonates well with the national mantra, Zimbabwe is open for business.Officiating at the Bulawayo is open for business investors engagement conference, Mohadi said the involvement of a highly powered business delegation from the Limpopo province of South Africa demonstrates the seriousness of the province in this renewed approach to business.If well handled the Limpopo province initiative that falls under the special development initiative could be the game changer to Bulawayo and the entire Matabeleland region.He also commended the city for availing incentives to investors saying that the city must embrace the special economic zones status and exploit it to its fullest.The Bulawayo economy is anchored on five clusters which include the National Railways of Zimbabwe, Cold Storage Commission, Ziscosteel, ZITF and the water bodies around the city.Sound infrastructure forms the basis of growth and development of the city while the agriculture value chains that include cattle to beef and leather value chain, small stock, small grains and the cotton to clothing sectors are key to the investment drive for Bulawayo. - zbc
