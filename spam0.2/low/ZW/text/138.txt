Grace Mugabe sucked into ivory scam Published: 21 March 2018 A state-sanctioned investigation into a massive ivory and rhino horn trafficking scandal that prejudiced the foreign currency-starved nation of millions of United State dollars has sucked in former first lady Grace Mugabe. Environment, Water and Climate minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri sensationally claimed Grace would occasionally ivory raid the country's ivory stockpile kept at the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks). The raids, according to Muchinguri-Kashiri, worsened when the Environment component of the ministry was assigned to former minister Edgar Mbwembwe, weeks before the fall of Grace's husband, Robert Mugabe. - Daily News
