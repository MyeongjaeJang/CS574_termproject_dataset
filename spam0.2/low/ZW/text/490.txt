Irene Kapenda was dragged to the civil court by Bertha Mutanda, who accused her of spreading malicious rumours. 
“She is in the habit of telling people that I was caught sleeping with a leader of an apostolic sect in the bush,” she said. 
“She is also saying that I am HIV-positive and even told some of my friends from church. She tells people that I spread HIV by sleeping with countless men.” 
Mutanda accused her neighbour of insulting her deceased children in an hour-long rant. 
“She insulted me for an hour and I did not respond. She even insulted my dead children. I am a sick person and I don’t want her abuse,” she said. 
Kapenda did not oppose her neighbour’s application, but accused Mutanda of lying. 
Kapenda said her neighbour once told her to venture into prostitution after she confided in her about her financial problems.
