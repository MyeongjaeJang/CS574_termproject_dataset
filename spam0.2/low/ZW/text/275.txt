3 000 get jobs in Midlands   AT least 3 000 people in the Midlands province have been engaged in different jobs by companies since the ushering in of the new political dispensation led by President Mnangagwa last November.In an interview yesterday Midlands Minister of State for Provincial Affairs, Owen Ncube, said he was pleased with the growth of the industrial sector in the past three months. He said the economy has started showing signs of growth across the country spurred by the measures being put in place by the new Government to create job opportunities for the people."I am very pleased to note that there has been a significant growth in the industries in the Midlands province, a growth that has seen about 3 000 people being employed as contract or permanent employees," said Minister Ncube."Bata Shoe Company has increased its workforce to 1 200 from 400. Unki Mines has employed about 1 000 people and Mimosa Mining Company has employed about 1 500 contract employees from the local communities."The minister said the Zimbabwe Mining and Smelting Company (Zimasco) has also re-engaged some of its former employees signalling brighter days for the province and the country at large. He said he had toured a number of companies in the province that include Caridorn Abrasives, Bata Shoe Company, Zimasco, Unki Mines, Mimosa Mining Company and Ziscosteel as part of his familiarisation tours since his appointment a few months ago. The minister said although the industrial sector has not yet reached its full potential, Government was optimistic that closed companies like asbestos miner, Shabanie Mashava Mines, would be re-opened and employ more people."It is our priority that companies like Ziscosteel, ZimAlloys and Shabani Mashava Mines open as a matter of urgency for the development of our country. We have since engaged the Minister Industry and Commerce Mike Bimha about the state of industries in Midlands and he said his ministry is committed to help us resuscitate these companies," said Minister Ncube.He said he was also pleased about progress made by the Gweru City Council (GCC) in the rehabilitation of roads and re-opening of Mtapa Maternity clinic."GCC has managed to refurbish about 27km of their roads after getting funds from Zinara. The local authority also managed to re-open Mtapa Maternity Clinic, which was closed in 2013 after it failed to meet the required health standards. So, we have every reason to smile and celebrate the coming in of the new dispensation," said the minister. - chronicle
