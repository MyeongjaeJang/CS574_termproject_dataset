A group of fans of Shabanie Mine FC team decided to say thanks to their team with a braai. 
The groups who converge through social media groups in Whatsapp decided to treat the entire team to a braai after their draw against new boys Nichrut yesterday. . 
Shabanie is yet to taste defeat this season having won one and drew two, including their inspiring draw against Dynamos where they needed to come from three goals down to draw 3-3. 
The Shabanie outfit has been without a sponsor and almost came close to being sold but fans have stood behind the team donating in cash and kind. 
Coach Takesure Chiragwi was delighted with the gesture of the team saying such treats to motivate the players during the difficult times. 
Club chairman Mr Jimmy Mhloro who was also present at the braai hosted at Caravan Park was happy with the arrangement and thanked the fans who were behind the initiative. Share this:
