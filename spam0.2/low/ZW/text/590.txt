Rusape stadium to host PSL matches 
Soccer24 on 27 Mar, 2018 
The First Instant Board which is responsible for ground inspection has approved the use of Vengere Stadium in Rusepe for Premier League matches. 
Mutare City Rovers will now use the venue to host their home matches, shifting base from the National Sports Stadium. Rovers will play their first match in Rusape on Monday against Harare City. 
Vengere has hosted top-flight football before, with relegated Buffaloes and Dongo Sawmills using the venue some few years ago. 
Meanwhile, other stadiums recently approved to host PSL matches are Ascot in Gweru and Nyamhunga in Kariba. Share this:
