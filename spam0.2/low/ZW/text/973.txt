HARARE - Zimbabwe's largest business lobby group, the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI), is pressing government to clear 40 of its members who were “wrongly” 
This comes as the Confederation’s sister organisation, Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC), on Thursday demanded government revises the list and clear those incorrec 
“We have therefore fixed a meeting with the RBZ governor on Monday as part of efforts to clear ourselves and return to normal business,” 
“Thirty two of our companies have come forward and submitted documents seeking to clear their names. We believe the remaining eight are either sorting their documents or they are returning the money if they truly externalised,” 
“We have examined the documents and realised that trading issues were mistaken for externalisation. We are going to be explaining to the governor that it’s not possible that all those companies could have externalised funds. The companies have supplied us with documents indicating they were simply exporting or importing but the transactions could not be processed on time for various reasons and the bank thought it was externalisation. 
“For example, if a payment for import or export has been made for 90 days and there is a delay, it could easily be mistaken for externalisation. We have companies which have those issues; whose payments were overdue,” 
“Remember Zimbabwe has a poor credit rating and when you are exporting for example, the foreign partner will only pay when they have received the goods,” 
“They can’t really blame Zimra for that. I think the Zimra system was down for just a month and that is a list which is 90 days. It took 90 days to compile that list but if you are going to be in export, you have to make sure that the moment the money or the goods come in, you must acquit them and you need to have a person who does that very diligently, otherwise you are going to run into problems. It’s a back office function but a very important function,”
