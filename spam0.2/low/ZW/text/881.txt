Dynamos coach Lloyd Mutasa has expressed his fears at his team’s poor performance as they slumped to a second defeat in their 3rd Premiership game. 
Dynamos followed up their power usurping 3-3 draw against Shabanie Mine with a rather disappointing 1 nil defeat to ever improving Ngezi Platinum Stars. 
The Dynamos squad assembled for the 2018 PSL not fully fit and are unprepared for the competition and coach Lloyd Mutasa is now a worried man. 
“We thought by conceding three goals against Shabanie, it was more to do with our defence being porous and we were working to rectify that as we thought our strikeforce was fine after scoring those three.”, Mutasa told the Chronicle. 
“Unfortunately, we failed to score. 
“It is getting worrisome as you saw we once again failed to defend a high ball. 
“I don’t know, it is an area where we have to always work on. It was also a case of defenders drawing a lot into the box. We would want to win each and every game but unfortunately we failed to win this one,” said Mutasa. 
Dynamos remains winless since the start of the Premier Soccer League having kicked off with a 1 nil loss to Chicken Inn. 
The Dynamos gaffer also bemoaned the absence of strike Christian Epoupa who continously remains on the sidelines protesting over his outstanding allowances and sign on fees. Share this:
