- The Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) has joined the country in mourning former boxing administrator Lovemore Malianga who succumbed to diabetes at Harare’s West End Hospital on Wednesday. 
SRC has been saddened to learn of the passing on of . . . Malianga...whose relationship with the SRC dated back to the 1990s when the SRC was running the Sport for All Programme and he was the chief focal point person for the partnership with the SRC and covered the then Central Region (Harare, Chitungwiza and Norton),” Muchechetere said. 
He was not only an avid sportsperson but was also an astute sports administrator and this resulted in him rising through the leadership ranks to become the president of the Zimbabwe Boxing Association and the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee as a Board member responsible for the Sports For All Commission until 2015.” 
As the SRC we had been aware that he was not been well for some time but we were hopeful that he was going to recover but that was not to be as God had other plans,” he said. 
Lovemore will be remembered for his zeal, passion and dedication to duty especially the development of sport at the grassroots level where he worked tirelessly to ensure that sports was accessed in Harare’s 19 suburbs then. 
He was also instrumental in organising the Annual Olympic Day which is a feature on our sporting calendar. His contribution to sport and recreation was undoubtedly immense as he was dedicated to community development through sport. 
On behalf of SRC board, management and staff, I would like to collectively offer our condolence to Lovemore’s family, Zoc and the boxing fraternity for the sad loss of a passionate and highly dedicated sportsperson of our time. 
May you be consoled by the knowledge his contribution to sport and recreation development will remain engrained in the history of our country.”
