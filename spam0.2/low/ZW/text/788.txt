THREE members of the Presidential Guard and a civilian teamed up and allegedly robbed a non-governmental organisation of $21 000. 
Ekem Zvomuya (34), Nabal Prosper Moyo (24) and Innocent Mutimutema (25) were not asked to plead when they appeared before magistrate Tilda Mazhande who remanded the matter to today for bail ruling. 
It is the Stateâ€™s case that on January 23, Zvomuya, Moyo and Mutimutema, in the company of Mildred Makoto, hatched a plan to rob More Than Conquerors Trust Organisation director Tawanda Zeze. 
The quartet, clad in ZNA uniform, went to the complainant in Belvedere where they alleged that they intended to take him to his workplace for some interviews regarding the operations of his organisation. 
The State alleges they led him into his bedroom to conduct a thorough search. In the bedroom, they ordered Zeze to open an inbuilt safe. 
The gang allegedly stole $21 000 and two mobile phones. It is alleged one of the suspects blindfolded Zeze with a towel and force-marched him out of the house to the main gate and they dragged him into their gate away vehicle. 
It is alleged along the way the suspects ordered Zeze to disclose his mobile money transfer trust account pin number and he complied. The gang withdrew $527. The State alleges the value stolen good is $21 713 and nothing was recovered.
