Fans who were eagerly awaiting the Premiere of the war movie Chinhoyi 7 will have to wait indefinitely as the filmmakers work frantically to edit out scenes that glorify the former President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe. 
The producers of the film announced two days before the premiere that the premiere was postponed due to reasons ‘beyond their control’. With the former President now looking like he wants to return to active politics, if the report is to be believed then that is not a coincidence. 
According to reports the film which was produced by the Zimbabwe Defence Forces and took almost 3 years to complete , glorifies Mugabe, a Newsday source reportedly says; ‘It has a lot of shortcomings like you have people chanting Pamberi NaMugabe’. 
The movie’s producer, Tawanda Sarireni has dismissed all this as a lie, he attributed the delay to failure to secure software needed for special effects ‘to ensure the movie is world class’ (That is one expensive copy of After Effects). 
Let’s hope the movie will come out eventually.
