TREY SONGZ NABBED 
Singer Trey Songz has been arrested for allegedly beating up a woman. Songz surrendered to LAPD early on Monday morning to face a felony domestic violence charge. 
According to TMZ, the singer turned himself in for the incident involving a woman he was out with in L.A. last month during NBA All-Star weekend. Songz is accused of brutally beating one Andrea Buera at a Hollywood Hills party where she claims he was upset because she was talking to another man. 
She alleged that the singer beat her so badly, that she suffered a concussion and had to go to a hospital for treatment. She also claimed that several people at the party witnessed the alleged beating. 
Following his arrest this morning, Trey Songz tweeted: ‘For weeks my lawyers & Mgmt have asked me not to comment on this and I initially agreed but this morning I feel that my fam, the women that raised me, my friends & fans especially the youth need to hear from me. 
I am being lied on and falsely accused for someone’s personal gain’ 
According to the report, he was booked at 6a.m, and released shortly after 8 a.m . He posted a $50,000 bond. Share this:
