Soccer24 on 1 Apr, 2018 
CAPS United will be looking for their first victory of the season when they face Black Rhinos at National Sports Stadium this afternoon. 
The Green Machine have drawn all of the three matches they have played so far. They came from behind to squeeze a point against Bulawayo Chiefs on Thursday. They are currently in 12th position, one place above Rhinos who also have the same number of points â€“ 3. 
The last time these two teams met, it ended in a goalless draw. 
Method Mwanjali and Oscar Machapa are still out of the squad while Denver Mukamba and Nigerian Abasirim Chidiebere are likely to start ahead of Wisdom Mutasa and Brian Muzondiwa respectively. 
Elsewhere, Chiefs who are yet to lose face Chapungu at Luveve Stadium. 
At Rufaro Stadium, Herentals host Yadah FC. The Students picked up their first set of points on Match-day 3 against struggling ZPC Kariba.
