Mnangagwa's list of looters deflating STAFF WRITER • 20 March 2018 12:09PM • 0 comments 
HARARE - President Emmerson Mnangagwa, since assuming office on November 24 last year, has really tried hard to stamp his mark on the country’s politics.

Without doubt, what was released yesterday doesn’t hit you in the face. It’s a list containing names of companies that might pass off as brief case companies. 
It also has names of nonentities who, with all due respect, do not qualify to be called looters. 
What Zimbabweans were expecting was a list showing how the money was removed from local banks to foreign banks in foreign lands such as the Caribbean Islands, which are generally regarded as safe havens by those illegally moving the money. 
It was also expected that the list would include the names of banks where the money is stashed, proprieties purchased and the countries were looters hid their assets. 
Instead, a plain list giving the names and amounts involved was what was released — leaving many questions than answers for Zimbabweans who had waited with bated breath for the release of “looters” list. 
This is a missed opportunity for ED’s government.
