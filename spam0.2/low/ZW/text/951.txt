Former Zimbabwe national cricket team coach, Heath Streak believes he did not deserve to be fired by his former employer for failing to qualify for the International Cricket Council (ICC) World Cup. 
Streak believes he did not deserve to be fired because he won Zimbabwe’s first One Day International away series victory when they defeated Sri Lanka last year. Said Streak: 
We were not given any explanation, never got any chance to explain ourselves. All we got was an e-mail from the Managing Director. I was told to communicate with the other members of the technical team that we should resign by 3pm on Friday or we would be fired. None of the guys resigned, so we have been summarily dismissed. My staff and I didn’t deserve to be sacked, we won first series in 17 years, we never had such crowds that we saw during the Qualifier even during my playing days. If we had failed to make the Super Six of the Qualifier then we deserved to be fired. 
Streak is now in India where he has taken up role as bowling coach of Indian Premier League side Kolkata Knight Riders.
