Mnangagwa heads to China to seek financial aid Published: 22 March 2018 President Emmerson Mnangagwa heads to China in the first week of April to try to secure greater access for Zimbabwe companies to that market and strengthen the Look East policy. In his first official visit to the world's second-largest economy since his rise to power through Mugabe, Mnangagwa is expected to push for more help, as Zimbabwe tries to revive an economy ravaged by insane policies. Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa and Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor John Mangudya are in Beijing to seek loans from China's Export-Import Bank for priority areas such as agriculture, machinery and equipment as well as health and water systems. - Daily News
