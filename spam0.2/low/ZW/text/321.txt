Warriors coach Sunday Chidzambwa says he has been impressed by the new players who made their international debut on Wednesday against Zambia. 
Zimbabwe are taking part in a Four-Nation Tournament in Ndola, and they failed to progress to the final after losing 5-4 on penalties to Chipolopolo. The national team will now play Angola in the 3rd/4th place playoffs this afternoon. 
Speaking to The Herald from Kitwe where the Warriors are based, Chidzambwa said they solved some problems in certain departments of their squad. 
“I was impressed by some of the guys who were playing for the first time and those I had not had a chance to closely look at, especially Mudimu (Alec) who was playing at centre-back and Chicksen (Adam) who is a good left back,” he said. 
“I was also happy with Marshall Munetsi, the Pirates midfielder, he is a very good anchorman, plays basic football and is very good at marking and Teenage Hadebe has vastly improved too. 
“I had been particularly worried about our centre back area, but Teenage and Mudimu did very well and I think our problems in that department may have been solved now,” Chidzambwa said. 
Big goalkeeper Edmore Sibanda, ZPC Kariba’s Takabva Mawaya, Divine Lunga, newboy Butholezwe Ncube of South African Premiership side Amazulu, Praise Tonha, Abbas Amidu and Chawapiwa were the players who started on the bench against Chipolopolo and are now set to feature in starting XI to face the Palancas Negras.
