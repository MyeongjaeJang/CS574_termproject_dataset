Preview: CLPSL Match-day 2 
Soccer24 on 24 Mar, 2018 
The Castle Lager Premier Soccer League continues this afternoon with five matches lined up across the country. 
Reigning Champions FC Platinum are set to play their first match in this season when they host Yadah at Mandava Stadium. 
Pure Platinum Play were scheduled to clash against ZPC Kariba last week, but the later did not travel to Harare insisting that they should play their home games in Kariba. 
Cameroonian Albert Eonde and Zambian Shadreck Mayembe are expected to make their league debut for FC Platinum today together with Farai Mupasiri, but defender Lawrance Muhlanga is not available for selection as he is not eligible to play until his former club Chicken Inn clears him. 
ZPC Kariba are also in action today, playing Black Rhinos away at National Sports Stadium. The match between Mutare City and Chapungu completes the doubleheader at the same venue this afternoon. 
Chicken Inn travel to Gweru to face newcomers Nichrut at Ascot Stadium. Both teams posted victories on Match-day 1 with the Gamecocks beating giants Dynamos while Nichrut pulled a shocker when they overcame Premiership returnees Mutare City. 
Harare City will be without Elisha Muroiwa against Bulawayo City. The defender is still awaiting international clearance from his former team in Tanzania Singida United. 
Captain Tendai Samanja and midfielder Malvin Gaki remain doubtful ahead of the game as coach Mark Harrison feels the players need some time to get into the shape after recovering from injuries. 
On the other hand, Amakhosi’s Morris Kadzola will also be missed due to an injury. 
Match-day two fixtures: 
Mutare City vs Chapungu (NSS – 13:00) Black Rhinos vs ZPC Kariba (NSS – 15:00) Harare City vs Bulawayo City (Rufaro Stadium) FC Platinum vs Yadah (Mandava Stadium) Nichrut vs Chicken Inn (Ascot Stadium)
