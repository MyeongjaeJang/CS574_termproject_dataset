STUDENTS at Lupane State University based at the institution’s campus in Lupane are up in arms with the authorities after they allegedly exempted students from the Department of Development Studies from paying accommodation fees. 
The students demonstrated on Friday last week over the issue and threatened to form an alliance against Development Studies students. 
Student Representative Council vice-president Mr Rutendo Nyeve said the unrest was caused by allegations that the university had authorised that students from the Development Studies Department should not pay for accommodation as they were coming for half a semester. 
“Development Studies students are supposed to relocate to the university campus in Lupane on 8 April, so we understand that they were initially told to pay $100 which is half of what other students paid for a full semester. However, this changed and we understand they are now coming to stay at no cost,” he said. 
This was also confirmed by other officials at the university who declined to be named. 
However, other sources at the institution said the move to let the students come and stay for free was because the department had threatened to demonstrate. 
“This department threatened the university officials with a demonstration as they did not want to relocate to Lupane, so as a way to appease the students, the university agreed that they stay for free. They are being enticed to relocate hence the decision,” said the source. 
LSU director of marketing and public relations Mr Zwelithini Dhlamini said he was yet to get finer details as he had not communicated with the responsible authorities >
