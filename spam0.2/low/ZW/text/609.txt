Jonathan Moyo sends SOS for Mugabe Published: 27 March 2018 FORMER Higher Education Minister Jonathan Moyo has sent out a public appeal to African leaders including Thabo Mbeki to save ousted President Robert Mugabe from harassment by authorities in Harare.Moyo used his Twitter account to call on Rwandan President and current African Union chairperson, Paul Kagame, South African leader, Cyril Rhamaposa and Ugandan strongman, Yoweri Museveni, as well as former leaders to help Mugabe."HE P Kagame, HE C Rhamaposa, HE (Thabo) Mbeki (former President of South Africa), HE B (Benjamin) Mkapa (former President of Tanzania), HE O (Olesegun) Obasanjo (former President of Nigeria), HE Y Museveni and HE K (Koffi) Annan (former UN secretary general). Coup rulers in Zimbabwe are persecuting your brother Mugabe. Please check on him," Moyo said.Moyo was a leading figure in a faction of the ruling Zanu-PF party then known as Generation 40 that was vanquished by President Emmerson Mnangagwa's Team Lacoste with assistance from the military last year in November.Mugabe was forced to resign after the army staged a largely bloodless coup paving the way for Mnangagwa who had been fired in early November as Vice President to sweep to power. - newzimbabwe
