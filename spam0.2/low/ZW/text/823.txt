Zimpapers CEO scoops Megafest business award Published: 30 March 2018 ZIMPAPERS CEO, Pikirayi Deketeke, won the Megafest Business Awards professional of the year award on Wednesday while Chronicle senior features reporter, Yoliswa Dube, scooped the print media personality of the year accolade.The awards, held at Rainbow Towers in Harare, were in honour of journalistic excellence having an impact on society. They were aimed at recognising great minds. The Herald was awarded first runner up for being the most consistent organisation.Dube could not hide her excitement and said she felt honoured after winning the award."I am beyond chuffed, most humbled and grateful. Unlike other awards where people put in entries, you are anonymously nominated. It means so much more that people noticed my work and thought it was worthy of recognition," she said."My heart still flutters when I think of the citation that preceded the award. I don't consider myself a personality. I didn't think I had that much reach but this award made me realise that I am not bad at all which is pretty cool. It's really God's grace."As journalists at Zimpapers' Bulawayo branch continue to excel, photo journalist Obey Sibanda was named, also on Wednesday in Harare, the first runner up in the photography section of the Gender and Media Connect awards for his coverage of women improvements in sports. The versatile photo journalist was also the second runner up in the news category of the same awards.Gibson Mhaka of B-Metro was the second runner up in the features section of the same awards for stories published in the Chronicle.Nhlalwenhle Ngwenya, of B-Metro also, received a special commendation for "a refreshing and innovative story on women empowerment." - zimpapers
