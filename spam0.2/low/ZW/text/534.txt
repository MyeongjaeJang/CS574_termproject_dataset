Rusape Town Council, in partnership with Chinhoyi University of Technology, has identified 15 sites where they intend to install traffic lights as the rapidly growing town faces traffic flow challenges, town secretary Solomon Gabaza has said.

The council needs $350 000 for the traffic lights after successfully installing solar-powered traffic lights at two points last year. 
In an interview with NewsDay yesterday, Gabaza said they were working tirelessly to change the face of Rusape. 
“We were having problems during the holidays because we are also a tourist town. Tourists who will be travelling to Nyanga and other tourist attraction areas in the province (Manicaland) also pass through our town, so we have to put the robots to curb traffic flow challenges,” he said 
He said congestion is usually caused by travellers from Harare and Mutare. 
“We have so far installed the robots at two centres and this year we are hoping to put the robots on two other centres. We have already identified 15 points, where we are going to install the robots,” Gabaza said. 
“We need $22 500 per point and we have spent about $45 000 on two points. If it were not for financial problems, we would finish the installation this year. Our target is to install robots at two points this year.” 
Cosmas Mamombe, an executive member in the Rusape Residents’ Trust, hailed the initiative. 
“’We are happy with this initiative that has been taken by our town council at least this is going to solve the traffic jam in the town,” he said. Related posts:
