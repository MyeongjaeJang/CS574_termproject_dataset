'Mugabe suffering memory loss'   President Robert Mugabe is now too old too old to remember anything and government is no longer taking his statements seriously, his successor and long time ally President Emmerson Mnangagwa told guests in Rwanda on Wednesday. Mnangagwa came to power through a military-assisted takeover of government that resulted in the fall of Mugabe and the scattering of the Generation 40 (G40) faction across the globe, but the former president is now throwing salvos at his former comrade, accusing him of ruling the country 'illegally'. Recently, Mugabe told selected journalists that Mnangagwa came to power through a military coup. - Daily News
