Liquid Telecoms to raise cash through IPO   Econet Group subsidiary Liquid Telecom has appointed three global banks to begin a process of listing the company on a major European Exchange. Leading publication TMT Finance, which tracks potential listings, has revealed that global banks JP Morgan, Citigroup and Standard Bank have been appointed to start the process of the listing. However, both Econet and Liquid remained tight-lipped about the appointments, neither confirming nor denying the reports. But another sign of the eminent listing was a filing statement issued by the company and picked up by financial media, in which it gave a standard introductory statement on the company, much in line with the requirements of most stock exchanges. - Business Weekly
