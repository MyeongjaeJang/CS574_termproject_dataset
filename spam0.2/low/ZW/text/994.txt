Soccer24 on 2 Apr, 2018 
Mamelodi Sundowns forward Khama Billiat returned to action on Sunday after a long layoff due to injury. 
Billiat started in the Nedbank Cup quarter-final tie against Cape Town City but did not finish the game as he was subbed off in the 79th minute. The 27-year old had a decent game and created Sundowns’ first goal which was scored by Percy Tau in the 54th minute. 
Khama also showed some brilliant skills when he beat his marker before cutting back the ball to Gaston Sirino who hit the crossbar from a close range.

City’s Matthew Rusike was not part of the squad. 
On Saturday, Talent Chawapiwa featured for Baroka FC against Kaizer Chiefs. The winger was in top form and delivered some excellent crosses which found no takers at some point. 
Amakhosi duo of Willard Katsande and Teenage Hadebe played for ninety minutes. Hadebe received a yellow card three minutes into the second half. 
Bloemfontein Celtic’s Ronald Pfumbidzai was in the starting eleven in his team’s loss to Maritzburg United. Temptation Chiwunga of Ubuntu Cape Town was also in action over the weekend, but his side failed to advance to the semi-finals of the Nedbank Cup. Share this:
