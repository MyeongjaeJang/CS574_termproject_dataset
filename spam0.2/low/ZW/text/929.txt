CLERGYMAN and aspiring presidential candidate Emmanuel Moyana of the Multi-People’s Democratic Party has said his party will field only female councillors to politically empower women and shrug off biased competition from their male counterparts.

Speaking during the launch of his party on Friday, Moyana said the party wants to promote gender equality by ensuring women occupy key roles in national development. He said the resolution to have all-women councillors was motivated by the fact that females had a more hands-on approach in tackling basic matters that affect communities. “The idea is to make sure that women are not side-lined,” Moyana said. 
“We decided to field women only as councillors. They will not be contested. At the parliamentary level, we will ensure that there is adequate representation of women as well. We need equality and everyone deserves a chance to work for the country.” 
Moyana said he was previously with MDC-T but parted ways with the main opposition party after sharp differences on policy. 
In a jibe aimed at MDC-T leader Nelson Chamisa, Moyana said he would not be focusing on building infrastructure for bullet trains but would ensure a good road network, functioning economy, adequate health care, education and respect for the rule of law.
