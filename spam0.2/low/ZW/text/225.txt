Red Café set for Harare opening Published: 21 March 2018 RED Café, which first opened its doors in Bulawayo last October, is spreading its wings nationwide with the opening of another branch in Harare this weekend.The restaurant/bar will be opening its second branch in Harare on Friday at an event that is set to change the face of entertainment in the capital city.The bar's manager, Johannes Chipoyera, said the spot would be similar to the one in Bulawayo as it would have the same vibe. Red Café Bulawayo, that has socialite Babongile Sikhonjwa as its CEO, is one of the most patronised spots in the City of Kings, especially by people visiting the city, something Chipoyera said they aim to do for the Harare outlet. With no entry fee, the trendy joint, also used by many as a meeting place, often attracts diverse crowds because of its relaxed environment and resident bands who regularly play there.Chipoyera said the Harare opening would be a red carpet affair that will be graced by A-list celebrities and socialites from the capital and Bulawayo."What sets this place apart from the rest is that it's a meeting place with a business centre complete with Wi-Fi, printers and photocopiers for the convenience of our clients who want to mix business and pleasure," Chipoyera said.For foodies, Chipoyera said a top chef had been hired to ensure that the place serves only the best cuisine. - zimpapers
