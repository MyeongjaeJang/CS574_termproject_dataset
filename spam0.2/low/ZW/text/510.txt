The presentation was made at a colourful ceremony at the Zimbabwe Dancers’ Association (DAZ) awards at the City Sports Centre in the capital. 
DAZ president Harpers Mapimhidze said the Mandisa Kings and Queens had been performing well throughout the years and they deserved the accolade. 
“This group has been shining all along and they are the best group outside Harare. We were impressed by their performance and their professionalism,” said Mapimhidze. 
“I would like to congratulate them for coming out tops. I wish them the best. They have done their best, their consistency has been above the rest,” he said. 
In an interview with The Standard Style last week, Club Mandisa director Boniface Nyamanhindi said Club Mandisa, the joint that hosts the dance group, strives to promote dance groups. He said he provided the platform for the dance group and many other artistes from all over the country. 
Dance groups have of late been attracting a huge following. 
“I am happy for them and it is quite encouraging to see our efforts being recognised. We want to thank the organisers of these awards as they will go a long way in motivating the dancers,” said Nyamanhindi. 
“Dance groups are without doubt the most followed performers and we have decided to host gigs every week so that we cater for the growing numbers of dance group lovers.” 
Club Mandisa hosts different dance groups and pole dancers every week from Thursday to Sunday.
