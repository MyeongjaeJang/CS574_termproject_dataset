'More resources for agricultural mechanisation' Published: 22 March 2018 LANDS and Agriculture minister, Perrance Shiri has said government will pour more resources to mechanise agriculture in order to boost productivity.Speaking at a SeedCo field day at Arnold Rattray Research Station in Shamva on Tuesday, Shiri said there was need to modernise agriculture with farmers having access to centre pivots as part of efforts to promote irrigation. "As a country we want to make farming easy for our farmers, we have received 80 centre pivots from Spain and have given them out to some farmers," he said."We are planning to bring in more and give them out to farmers again so that we modernise our agriculture."Shiri said the ministry was in the process of rehabilitating dilapidated irrigation systems and wanted to ensure that all water bodies in the country were fully utilised for the benefit of the country.He told the hundreds of farmers at the field day that dam construction was a priority area for the government to ensure the success of irrigation development.Shiri said the government fully supported companies which developed seeds that were drought resistant as this would give the country a bumper harvest.Tichaona Mubvuti, a commercial farmer, encouraged Seed Co to decentralise field days so as to benefit other smallholder farmers.The field day was graced by farmers from Zimbabwe, Malawi and Tanzania. - newsday
