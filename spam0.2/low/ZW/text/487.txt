Although Bulawayo City dominated the game, especially in the first half, they failed to capitalise on a number of chances that came their way. It only needed veteran striker Vengesai’s late effort to settle the tie. 
Bulawayo City coach Darlington Dodo was disappointed by his players’ inability to utilise the chances that came their way. 
“We didn’t do ourselves a good favour. We controlled the game, we settled quickly, but we were too elaborate in front of goal. In the end, it backfired. I think we wanted to walk the ball into the net, which was very unfortunate,” he said. 
Harare City coach Mark Harrison was pleased with the win, saying he was impressed by the team’s overall performance. 
“The first half was shocking. It should have been two or three-nil against us at half-time, but Bulawayo City did not take the chances. They dominated the first half,” Harrison said. 
“The turning point was when Tendai Samanja came in and we had more stability, which we lacked in the first half. We didn’t concede any goal today and we collected maximum points. We will move on to the next game with confidence.”
