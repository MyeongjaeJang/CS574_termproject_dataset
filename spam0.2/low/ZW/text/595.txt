Warriors captain, Knowledge Musona, returned to training with the team yesterday, albeit a light workout, after staying away from action due to injury. 
The 27-year-old appeared in KV Oostende’s training session doing a few exercises in solo. 
According to KV Oostende doctor Musona won’t resume full training for another week and could play games in two weeks time ahead of Belgian Europa play offs. 
The striker, however, has resumed training and it will be known today if he will be fit for the crucial resumption of the Belgian Pro League play offs starting on the 2nd of April.
