Highlanders are confident they will pull off a result against Dynamos today when the two teams clash in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League. 
Currently without a win in the Premier Soccer League, Dynamos are hoping to cut down the lead held by teams at the top of the league standings, with just three games played so far. 
Today’s Battle of Zimbabwe against rivals Dynamos is far from a championship decider,but winning a match of this magnitude is a mental boost not even a credible shrink can mastermind. 
Not only does this fixture carry the benefits of unique bragging rights, but Dynamos will also be eager to right the wrongs of a horrendous start that has seen them draw only once and lose back to back matches. 
On the other hand Highlanders youngsters have been going through their business smartly and are yet to taste defeat having won twice and drawn once. 
Highlanders coach Madinda Ndlovu believes his charges are at the right frame of mind to focus on a victory. 
“The boys will go into the game with the morale high because they had a lot of positives on the pitch and a lot of acceptance from the supporters, the technical team and everybody around them really. They got a lot of praises to say they played very well which is a plus for us as we go to play against Dynamos,” Ndlovu told the Chronicle. Share this:
