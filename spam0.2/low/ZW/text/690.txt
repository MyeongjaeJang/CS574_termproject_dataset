Highlanders captain Honest Moyo has called on his teammates to forget being complacent as they prepare for matchday 3 and 4 this Easter weekend. 
Bosso, the third team yet to drop a point, are at home to Triangle United on Friday before heading to Harare where they will face Dynamos. Madinda Ndlovu’s men won their first match 2-1 against Black Rhinos before their last weekend 2-0 triumph over Herentals, which means the team will be bubbling with confidence going forward. 
But Moyo insists Bosso must do everything to win their games without reading much from previous results. 
“Two out of two sounds perfect until you analyse history and get to understand football better,’’ Moyo told the Chronicle. 
“We have beaten Black Rhinos and Herentals on the trot, which is good as the results have given us something to smile about. 
“I just want to advice my teammates to keep their feet on the ground. While we have played well and won our first two games, we should also remember that we have to keep the spirit and try to win the other games to follow.”, he added. Share this:
