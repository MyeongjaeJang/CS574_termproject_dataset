Herentals Revels In First Premiership Win 
Soccer24 on 30 Mar, 2018 
Herentals coach Kumbirai Mutiwekuziva is now looking forward to their next match against Yadah after the club registered its first win of the season against ZPC Kariba. 
After two straight identical 2-0 losses to Ngezi Platinum and Highlanders, captain Blessing Majarira scored the club’s first goal which gave them their first win away in Kariba. 
“I am the happiest man on earth right now because it’s not easy coming here to Nyamhunga stadium and get a result, let alone a win,” said Mutiwekuziva. 
“This is going to be a big morale booster for the boys ahead of the match against Yadah. 
“The boys are now beginning to adjust to premiership football. We lost in the previous games not because we were bad but it was because we were still adjusting,” he added. 
The win for Herentals added more misery to ZPC Kariba who are still to get a point after they were docked of points for refusing to travel to Harare for a season opener against FC Platinum before losing 2-0 to Black Rhinos. Share this:
