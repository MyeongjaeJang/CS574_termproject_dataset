FORMER Air Zimbabwe chief executive officer Ripton Muzenda has taken the national carrier to court demanding over $42 801 in terminal benefits, four months after termination of his contract on allegations of misconduct. 
BY CHARLES LAITON 
Muzenda left the national airline in October last year, leading to the signing of a deed of settlement between the parties. In his court application, Muzenda accused the airline of defying the settlement. 
Part of the deed of settlement signed on October 20, 2017 read: “Whereas the employee (Muzenda) has at all material times been employed by the employer (AirZim) as the chief executive officer; and whereas certain serious misconduct charges were raised by employer against the employee leading to the employee’s suspension without pay and benefits with effect from October 6, 2017; and whereas the parties have agreed to enter into a mutual termination of the employee’s contract of employment with the effective date of such termination being October 2017.” 
Muzenda claimed he earned a gross salary of $9 178 before he entered into a written mutual termination of contract agreement on October 20 last year. 
“In terms of clause 2 of the agreement, the statutory terminal package payable to the plaintiff was one-and-a-half month’s salary, three months’ salary in lieu of outstanding leave days and pro-rated October 2017 salary and benefits up to October 6, 2017,” Muzenda said in his declaration. 
“The defendant, therefore, owes the plaintiff the total sum of $42 801, being total amount after adding $13 767, $27 534 and $1 500. 
“The defendant failed to honour its obligation to pay the terminal package set out above. The defendant is, therefore, indebted to the plaintiff in respect of the same.” 
He added: “Despite demand and the plaintiff acknowledging indebtedness in its correspondence with the plaintiff, defendant has failed, refused and or neglected to pay the sum of $42 801.” 
The summons were issued on February 12, 2017 and Air Zimbabwe is yet to enter its appearance to defend. Related posts:
