Messi, Suarez score late as Barca draw Sevilla 
Soccer24 on 1 Apr, 2018 
Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez scored in the final two minutes to earn Barcelona a dramatic 2-2 draw against Sevilla and extend their unbeaten record in La Liga to 37 games. 
Sevilla took the lead in the first half thanks to Franco Vazquez’s close-range finish before Luis Muriel doubled the home side’s advantage shortly after half-time. 
It looked as though Sevilla would become the first team to beat Barcelona in the league this season before Suarez set up a nervy finish with an emphatic volley in the 88th minute. 
Then just 55 seconds later, Messi, who had come on as a substitute in the 57th minute, swept a trademark strike from the edge of the box into the bottom corner to complete a miraculous turnaround. 
In Italy, Juventus cruised to a 3-1 victory over AC Milan. 
Paulo Dybala, Juan Cuadrado and Sami Khedira all scored for Juve in a win which extended their lead over Napoli at the top of the Serie A standings to four points and was the perfect preparation for their quarter-final first leg match against Real on Tuesday. 
Leonardo Bonucci scored Milan’s only goal of the night in the 28th minute to draw the visitors back on level terms with the Bianconeri following Dybala’s eighth-minute opener. 
However, Cuadrado edged Juve back in front in the 79th minute when he fired the ball into the net from Khedira’s pinpoint cross, before the midfielder drove home from Dybala’s assist. Share this:
