Madinda Not Impressed

Highlanders coach Madinda Ndlovu was not impressed despite his side beating Herentals 2-0 away at the National Sports stadium on Sunday. 
The win gave Bosso a perfect build-up to their next fixture in Harare for the blockbuster clash against their biggest rivals Dynamos on Easter Monday. 
“We didn’t play well, we had a slow start. Actually, Herentals did their homework, and they played well in the first half in which they could have scored,” said Madinda. 
“We didn’t play the way we wanted, we could not penetrate them through the wings, and that’s the reason we had to change tactics in the second half, and it paid off. Credit should also go to my boys for winning in a match, but they were off form,” said Ndlovu. 
Herentals had the better share of possession and scoring opportunities in the first half but were wasteful. The league’s new boys were also hamstrung by the decision to play club owner Innocent Benza who was a liability as he could neither link up play nor run. 
A master stroke substitution by Highlanders coach which saw Ozias Zibande replace Newman Sianchali changed the complexion of the game with Bosso getting into the lead only two minutes after Zibande’s introduction. 
Zibande who is a making a return to Highlanders after a stint in Botswana sealed the victory five minutes from time, heading a cross from enterprising right back MacClive Phiri. Share this:
