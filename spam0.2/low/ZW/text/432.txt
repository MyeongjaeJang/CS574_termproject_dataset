Herentals plot Bosso upset SPORT EDITOR • 25 March 2018 10:06AM • 0 comments 
HARARE - Castle Lager Premiership new boys Herentals believe they can get their first victory in the top flight when they face Bulawayo giants Highlanders at the National Sports Stadium this afternoon. 
The Students were humbled 2-0 by Ngezi Platinum Stars at Baobab Stadium last weekend in their first match of the season. 
Herentals coach Kumbirai Mutiwekuziva reckons his charges have learned quickly and now know what is required in order to get a positive result against Bosso. 
“This is actually one game that we must treat with caution looking at the kind of team we are playing against; Highlanders is a big team,” Mutiwekuziva told the Daily News on Sunday. 
“We had a chance to correct or amend those mistakes during our training sessions this week. I’m sure in this game against Highlanders; we can get something positives to give to the fans.” 
A new-look Bosso under their former striker Madinda Ndlovu started the 2018 campaign with a well-deserved 2-1 win over Black Rhinos. 
Highlanders got their goals from Godfrey Makaruse and Gabriel Nyoni but Ndlovu was particularly impressed by goalkeeper Ariel Sibanda. 
“The boys came to the party and they did not disappoint. Ariel (Sibanda) is one of the seasoned players within our ranks and I think he did very well. 
“He commanded his defence and around his area in a very professional manner. Yes of cause we did concede that goal to Rhinos but I think it was just a case of miscommunication between Ariel and his defence.”
