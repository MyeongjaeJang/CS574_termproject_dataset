Zimpapers going to war with DStv and Kwese Published: 23 hours ago In January the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe (BAZ) called for interested parties to submit licence applications for; Video On Demand Services (VoD), Webcasting Services and Content Distribution Services. Zimpapers are very much interested in entering this field as they have applied for the Content Distribution Services licence.This move seems to be more in tune with the times and might see Zimpapers become a competitor of popular services such as Kwese and DStv who offer subscription content. Back in 2015, Zimpapers had promised that they would be embracing digital but up until now the changes they would implement were neither drastic nor clear. They did launch ZTN (Zimpapers Television Network) in October of 2017 but that was more of an online streaming service. The new licence they are applying for seems to be promising a more traditional TV service. - techzim
