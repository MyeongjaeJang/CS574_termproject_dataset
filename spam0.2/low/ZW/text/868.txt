HIGHLANDERS coach Madinda Ndlovu will not shield his players from possible injury ahead of the biggest game in the land against Dynamos on Monday when Bosso face Triangle on Friday . 
Ndlovu indicated that he wants to get the best out of his players and for that reason they will not classify any opponents with the best team chosen for all their matches. He said out of the 30 players he has in his squad, those who perform at training ahead of a match will get selected to play. @Mdawini_29
