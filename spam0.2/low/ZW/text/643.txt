Edgars goes to court to recover $40 000 Published: 26 March 2018 Edgars Stores in Bulawayo allegedly lost more than $40 000 it paid to a Harare company for supply of printers.The retail chain paid $43 000 into Nasraq Technologies' bank account in 2016 and the company failed to deliver the printers which it claimed were being sourced from a company in Korea.A court heard that Nasraq's director, Sobusa Dube, who is also representing the company sent the clothing retailer a copy of the purchase order purporting that the printers had been bought.Dube pleaded not guilty to two counts of theft before Bulawayo magistrate Ms Sthembiso Ncube who remanded the matter to April 6.Prosecuting, Mr Alfonce Makonese alleged that in 2016 Edgars Stores requested for quotations for the supply of Bixolon point of sale printers and Nasraq won the tender.Mr Makonese said Edgars chose Nasraq as it had the lowest prices."The complainant immediately issued Nasraq with a purchase order and Edgars was supposed to deposit half of the total price. The remaining amount was to be paid after delivery," he said."On June 21, 2016, Edgars deposited $43 000,80 through Nasraq's NMB account and the accused assured Edgars that they would deliver the goods by July 30,the same year. On the following day Dube sent a copy of a purchase order saying he had bought the printers from Bixolon Company Limited in Korea."A few days later, he sent a sample of the printers to Edgars and the complainant tested it and discovered that the power cords were not going to work in Zimbabwe and gave Nasraq the right type of cords."The court heard that Nasraq failed to supply the goods and kept on giving Edgars promises until the matter was reported to the police. - chronicle
