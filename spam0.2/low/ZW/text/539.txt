Chamisa, who was elevated to succeed Tsvangirai by the MDC-T national council, is facing massive resistance from expelled deputy president Thokozani Khupe and other disgruntled officials who are against his ascendancy. 
Addressing thousands of party supporters at Nzvimbo Growth Point on Sunday, Vimbai said Chamisa was the right candidate to take “Zimbabwe to Canaan”. 
“I want to tell you this secret, I was close to my father, but the man called Chamisa is our first born in our family. My father told us a lot, but some of the secrets we would ask the President (Chamisa). I want to remind you that Tsvangirai’s legacy is not dead. He left us Chamisa who will take us to Canaan,” she said. 
Vimbai had been linked to Chamisa’s deputy, Elias Mudzuri, who also had initially contested the leadership wrangle. 
She was touted as the aspiring MP for Glen View South constituency and during the address, MDC-T supporters shouted “Glen View South”. Related posts:
