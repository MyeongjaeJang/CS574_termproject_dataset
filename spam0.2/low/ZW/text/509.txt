  Moyo releases anti-Mugabe book Moyo releases anti-Mugabe book   
Kwekwe human rights activist Nkosilathi Emmanuel Moyo has released a book that takes a dig at the alleged undemocratic systems in government left during and after the rule of former president Robert Mugabe.

Moyo, who is currently in Germany as a resident artist, said the book, titled, Dismantling the System of Mugabeism, would be launched in Berlin on March 29. 
“Dismantling the System of Mugabeism speaks to the political dynamics in the pre and post-Mugabe era,” Moyo told The Standard Style. 
“Mugabe the person might have been removed, but the system he established is still intact and can only be removed by removing Zanu PF in its entirety in the coming polls.” 
In the the book, Moyo argues that what happened in November last year when Mugabe was removed from power by the army was not a people’s revolution, but the ruling party solving its succession issues with President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s faction — Team Lacoste — backed by the military. 
He said he would come to Zimbabwe next month to launch the book in his hometown of Kwekwe and other parts of the country. 
The human rights campaigner has published other books, criticising Mugabe and the Zanu PF-led government. The books include Robert Mugabe: from Freedom Fighter To The People’s Enemy, The Rise of Grace Mugabe-The Fall of Zanu PF and Zimbabwe: A Revolution Waiting To Happen. 
In November last year Moyo released a 14-track album with most of the songs being political satires against Mugabe and Zanu PF, whom the activist accused of destroying the country’s economic and political fortunes. 
Moyo courted controversy in 2016 after he sent Mugabe prison garb as a birthday present.
