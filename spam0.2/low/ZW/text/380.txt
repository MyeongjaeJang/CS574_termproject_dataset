Newly promoted Bulawayo Chiefs are ready for the visit of Harare giants Caps United as the Castle Lager Premiership season enters Matchday two with a mouth-watering showdown at Luveve Stadium on Sunday. 
The new comers started the season with a commendable 2 all draw against Yadah FC having thrown away a 2 nil lead. On the other hand, visiting Caps United got off their campaign with a goalless draw against Harare City. 
Bulawayo Chiefs coach Gartly Chipuka is confident of a good performance against Caps United. 
“Caps United are big team but we are not reading much into the tag, our focus is to get maximum points and utilise home advantage and hopefully we will come out victorious. 
“We scored twice in our last match and they failed to score against Harare City, that gives my team some kind of confidence ahead of today’s match,” Chipuka told the Sundaymail. Share this:
