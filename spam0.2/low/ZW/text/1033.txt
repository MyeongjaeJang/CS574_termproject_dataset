MSU owes lecturers over $700,000 Published: 02 April 2018 Lecturers at the Midlands State University have threatened to down tools in a fortnight until they are paid outstanding allowances amounting to over $700 000. The Midlands State University Lecturers' Association (MSULA) made their intentions known in a letter addressed to the Acting Vice Chancellor Professor Ngonidzashe Muzvidziwa and copied to the Registrar Mr Erasmus Mupfiga following their meeting on March 26.The strike will affect all full-fee paying students, most of whom are studying at various campuses across the country."It was resolved that lectures for all full-fee paying classes, including Harare programmes will be discontinued with effect from Saturday, 14 April 2018," part of the letter reads."Reasons for discontinuing those classes are; members relocated to other campuses have not been fully compensated and in spite of various works council resolutions, the university continue to drag its feet; members have delivered part-time lectures to PDP, block and visiting classes in Gweru, Harare and elsewhere, but the university has introduced the aspect of 'viability threshold', which it continues to shift in order to avoid paying for services rendered."To date, members are owed more than $700 000 in disputed and unpaid claims. Several meetings and works council resolutions have failed to work."MSULA said the industrial action would not affect conventional students and that they would only resume work after their grievances have been addressed.Professor Muzvidziwa could not be reached for comment yesterday, while Mr Mupfiga refused to speak on the matter last night."I am at my farm, why are you calling me at this time. Go back to the person who gave you that letter and he or she will tell you what you want," Mr Mupfiga said.A source at MSU said the university management was refusing to pay them their dues, arguing that the block release and visiting students' classes were unviable.The lecturers are disappointed that while they are not being paid their dues, management at the institution were paying each other $2 500 vehicle purchase allowance monthly for the next five years, while ignoring their plight. - online
