Foreign, direct investors eye Kariba Published: 31 March 2018 Foreign and domestic investors are angling towards creating a competitive package for the resort town of Kariba in anticipation of improved arrivals from international markets, with revelations that preparations are already on the ground for Zimbabwe's second largest houseboat earmarked for the resort town.The first version of this idea named "The African Dream" was a marvel across Zimbabwe with its imposing magnitude measuring an impressive 33.4 metres in length.The developers of this project, Flame of Africa managing director Mr Brett McDonald said they are now preparing the groundwork for another larger and better version of "The African Dream" which will be specifically for Kariba, a development widely expected to effectively position the resort town and recoup on lost arrivals over the last years.Kariba Publicity Association information officer Mr Laiton Kandawire said the investment appetite is also drawn towards infrastructure with a number of foreign investors lining up to commit their funds into the area.Given the record figures recorded on inbound tourism for the month of December attributable to a number of factors, among them the removal of impeding aspects such as roadblocks, tour operators are optimistic of improved arrivals from the country's traditional source markets such as the United Kingdom, United States and Germany.Recent commitments by regional airline operators such as Kenya and South African Airways to feed tourism traffic from their Heathrow flight routes have also given impetus to the industry which is now projecting a strong finish this year - zbc
