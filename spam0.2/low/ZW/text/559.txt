The celebrations — running under the theme Ebenezer: Thus far the Lord has helped us — started on Friday and ends today with a combined service which will be spiced up by music from Mahachi, Nigerian gospel singer Steve Crown and South Africa’s Neyi Zimu. 
Nigerian South Africa-based Pastor Francis Anosike is hosting the event at the church’s premises in Newton, Johannesburg. 
“It feels good to share the stage with big names in gospel music in Africa like Steve Crown and South Africa’s Neyi Zimu. It means a lot to someone who is growing in the industry like me,” Mahachi told The Standard Style from South Africa. 
Mahachi is not new to the South African gospel music scene; having been a regular participant at the late S’fiso Ncwane-organised Gospel All Stars music concerts and recently he graced the Abathandwa Music Group’s album at the Durban Christian Centre. 
He made his name in South Africa after teaming up with Ncwane on the track Ndinoda Jesu (Ngiyamuthanda UJesu). Incidentally, the late Ncwane was a member of Rock of Victory Celebrations Ministries International. 
Crown, who is based in Abuja, Nigeria, became popular after his first hit song You are Great took the market by storm. His other popular tracks include We Wait On You, All the Glory and God of Wonders. 
Zimu is a multi-award winning South African gospel singer known for hits such as Sinenqaba, Ufanelwe, The waiting is Over and Miracle, among others.
