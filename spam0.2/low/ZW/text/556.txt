There are unconfirmed reports that yesterday night at the Beitbridge border post a bus driver was caught with 16 Zimbabwean passports by the SA Revenue Service (SARS) scanner official. 
It is alleged that the bus driver had put the passports in his bag and the scanner rang several times pointing that there are suspicious documents in the bag. The driver was then submitted to a search by the authorities and after the search, SARS officials found the passports which already had the arrivals and departures stamps from the South African immigration department. 
SARS officials then went to immigration supervisors to report the issue and a case of fraud was opened. The driver was locked up. There are indications that the Immigration officers who stamped the passports will also be arrested. Share this:
