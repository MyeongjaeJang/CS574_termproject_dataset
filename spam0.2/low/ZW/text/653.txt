'Banks de-risk, invest in TBs' Published: 26 March 2018 PARLIAMENT's Budget Office says banks have reduced lending to the private sector, choosing instead to de-risk by investing in secure Government instruments such as Treasury Bills.Increased lending to Government, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is on record saying, has the tendency of crowding out private sector, which negatively affects the economy."Banks have not been as supportive as expected as evidenced by their de-risking and reduced lending to the private sector in favour of less risky Treasury Bills," the budget office said."This de-risking largely explains the increase in net credit to Government of 70,45 percent to $6,27 billion in 2017, while credit to the private sector rose by 6,97 percent to $3,71 billion."Parliament's Budget Office said that overall, bank lending to local economic agents grew by 44,31 percent, from $7,55 billion in November 2016 to about $10,64 billion in November 2017.
