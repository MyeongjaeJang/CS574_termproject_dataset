No Need To Panic: Dynamos 
Soccer24 on 26 Mar, 2018 
Dynamos assistant coach Biggie Zuze feels it’s too early to start writing them off after surrendering a healthy 3-0 lead to share spoils against Shabanie Mine. 
“We know a lot of things will be said. With just two games played, you cannot win the league, and you can also not be relegated. So we are not pressing the panic button now,” said Zuze. 
“We noted some positives because we could score and the character was there especially after losing the first game away to Chicken Inn. 
“We now need to regroup as a team and focus on the positives. 
“We lost because we failed to defend, the defence was relaxing, thinking we have already won the game,” added Zuze. 
Dembare’s next opponents are high flying Ngezi Platinum on Thursday. Ngezi Platinum who are one of the dark horses for the title have managed six points in the starting matches after beating Herentals in the opening match. Dynamos will then play against Highlanders on Easter Monday. Share this:
