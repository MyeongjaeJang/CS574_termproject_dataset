NEWSDAY readers have rapped the expelling of five-year-old Enos Mucheriwa Choga from a crèche at 1 Commando Barracks over his father’s allegiance to Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai’s MDC-T party saying the child was innocent and could not be victimised for his father’s political affiliation. 
STAFF REPORTER 
The boy’s father, Kubvoruno Choga, who is the MDC-T secretary for Chirumanzu-Zibagwe district in Midlands South, was recently summoned to 1 Commando Barracks and reportedly interrogated for about an hour by senior army officers seeking to establish his political background. 
His son was later expelled following the meeting with the school administration. 
Commenting on the paper’s social media platforms, readers castigated the army, saying it had exhibited the behaviour of people with “small minds” by ejecting “this five-year innocent child”. 
A reader indentified as Sihle said it was “wiser” for Choga to find another crèche for his child than have him caught up in a political storm. 
“There are many crèches around. Choga may be victimised or even killed for disclosing such issues to the Press and the child would have no one to look after him,” she said. 
Another reader Chirandu said such behaviour was shameful as children did not have to be dragged into adults’ political disputes. 
“These are desperate actions by puppets of an ailing regime. You will go one way soon,” wrote another reader, Igwe. Related posts:
