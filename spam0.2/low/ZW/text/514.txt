Sibanda sees improvement in Mighty Warriors camp 
Soccer24 on 26 Mar, 2018 
Mighty Warriors coach Sithethelelwe Sibanda says there has been a considerable progress during the 6 days that the team has been training together. 
The National Women’s Team are preparing for the AWCON Qualifier match against Namibia next month. 
In an interview with ZIFA media , Sibanda said: “When we started their fitness was not so good, but they are improving daily. 
“There is still a lot of work to be done for us to be able to compete, I am hopeful that will be achieved by the end of the week.” 
The gaffer, however, feels there is a limited time for the girls to fully get into shape and would have wanted her charges to play a competitive friendly match before their game. 
“The preparation time is definitely not enough, we would have loved more time together, and probably a competitive friendly match to gauge our fitness and competitiveness. 
“A positive result in the away match is critical so that we relieve ourselves of intense pressure in the deciding match at home. If we cannot win, we have to score.” 
Zimbabwe will play the first leg away in Namibia on April, 5 before they host their opponents three days later at Rufaro Stadium. Share this:
