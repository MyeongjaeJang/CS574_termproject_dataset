NSSA directors face axe Published: 18 hours ago At least four National Social Security Authority (NSSA) directors, including CEO Elizabeth Chitiga, will be relieved of their duties after the Easter holidays, it has emergedThe impending sacking of the directors comes barely a week after Labour minister Petronella Kagonye fired NSSA board chairperson Robin Vela.Among the directors likely to be affected are Emmerson Mungwariri (finance and operations), David Makwara (investments) and Barnabas Matongera (contributions, collections and compliance).However, Chitiga yesterday said she was not aware of the developments."Am hearing that from you," Chitiga said. "In any case, if there is the decision to fire me, I will only know when I receive the letter of dismissal. They cannot discuss that with me."It was not clear whether the dismissals were approved by the board that sat on Thursday after the dismissal of Vela or it was a directive from the minister.The reasons for the impending dismissal were not clear yesterday, but sources said they were linked to maladministration and alleged abuse of funds.In firing Vela, Kagonye cited a clause in the law governing NSSA that forbids the appointment of a non-resident Zimbabwean on the board of the pay-as-you-go pension scheme.Vela was appointed board chairman in 2015 when Prisca Mupfumira was in charge of the then Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare ministry. - the standard
