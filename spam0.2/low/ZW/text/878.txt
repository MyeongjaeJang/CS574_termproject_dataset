Three match officials from the COSAFA region have been selected to do duty at the 2018 FIFA World Cup to be held in Russia this June. 
Zambian referee Janny Sikazwe will blow the whistle while South Africa’s Zakhele Siwela and Jerson dos Santos from Angola are the assistant referees. Sikazwe is not new to big tournaments as he once officiated the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan and the final of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon. 
The Southern African trio were named by FIFA on Thursday as part of the 36 referees and 63 assistant referees for the tournament. Other African referees selected are Mehdi Abid Charef (Algeria), Malang Diedhiou (Senegal), Bakary Gassama (Gambia), Gehad Grisha (Egypt) and Bamlak Tessema Weyesa (Ethiopia). 
The world football’s governing body said the final selection was based on each referee’s skills and personality, as well as his level of understanding of football and ability to read both the game and the various tactics employed by teams. Share this:
