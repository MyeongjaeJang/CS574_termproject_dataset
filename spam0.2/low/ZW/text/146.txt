A superb hundred by Brendan Taylor proved not enough with Zimbabwe beaten by four wickets by West Indies at Harare Sports Club on Monday, the first defeat for the host nation in the International Cricket Council Cricket World Cup Qualifier. 
Zimbabwe must now beat United Arab Emirates on Thursday while the Windies, now on top of the log with six points take on Scotland on Wednesday with the winner of that contest guaranteed one of the two slots at next yearâ€™s Cricket World Cup in England. 
Taylor struck 20 fours and two sixes on his way to scoring 138 runs, his tenth One Day International ton as Zimbabwe, who won the toss and opted to bat posted 289 runs. Half centuries by man of the match Marlon Samuels(86) Shai Hope (75) and Evan Lewis (64) handed West Indies their first win of the Super Six stage.
