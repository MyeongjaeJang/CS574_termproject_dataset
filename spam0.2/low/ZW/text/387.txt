Crocodile skin prices buoy Padenga Published: 25 March 2018 Crocodile skins and meat producer, Padenga Holdings, yesterday reported a 53 percent increase in profit after tax for the year ended December 31, 2017, buoyed by firming prices.The group reported a profit after tax of $12,9 million for the period under review, up 52,98 percent from $8,4 million reported in the previous period.In a statement accompanying the results, group chairperson Alexander Calder said the improvement was a result of firm prices supported by other factors."The group, again, produced outstanding financial results. These were a consequence of firm prices coupled with improved operational efficiencies and fiscal discipline that resulted in reduced cost of sales," said Calder.The group recorded an operating profit before depreciation, amortisation, impairment and fair valuation adjustments of $13,9 million after reporting $12,6 million in 2016.The group's revenues for the 12 months to December 31, 2017 amounted to $30,3 million.

Operating profit and profit before tax increased by eight percent and 35 percent to $13 934 470 and $17 008 557 respectively," said Calder. - The Financial Gazette
