Govt to receive more tractors, centre pivots Published: 26 March 2018 Government is expecting tractors and an additional 80 centre pivots from Brazil as it continues to promote mechanization of agriculture. This was revealed by Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement Minister Air Chief Marshal Perrance Shiri (Rtd) at a Seed Co Zimbabwe field day held at Rattray Arnold Research Station in Goromonzi last week. "In the next two months we are expecting tractors for the A2 farmers as the A1 were catered for by the Brazil More Food for Africa Programme," he said. Minister Shiri said the tractors would not be given for free and farmers would be required to pay with first preference being given to farmers who were not in arrears. - The Herald
