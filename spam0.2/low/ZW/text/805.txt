Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) dominated the Gender and Media Awards, with three of its journalists bagging accolades at a ceremony held at a local hotel on Wednesday night. The awards, which are organised by the Gender and Media Connect (GMC), were held in recognition of good journalistic practices of ensuring women’s access to expression in the media and flagging relevant or topical issues from a gender perspective.

AMH is the largest independent media house in Zimbabwe and the publishers of Zimbabwe Independent, The Standard, NewsDay and Southern Eye. 
The Standard’s Moses Mugugunyeki won the Specialised Reporting category with AMH online reporter Tapiwa Zivira coming in as the first runner-up. 
Tafadzwa Ufumeli walked away with the photojournalism award, while AMH was the runner-up in the institutional category. 
AMH was rewarded for having the highest number of females promoted at editorial level. 
According to an adjudication panel report, 50 submissions were submitted by male journalists and 21 by female journalists. 
The adjudicators said the kind of scenario reflects a shift in the mind-set that gender issues can only be dealt with by female journalists. 
“It is particularly pleasing to see that male journalists and writers in Zimbabwe have embraced the Gender Media Awards and submitted some outstanding pieces,” GMC board member John Masuku said. 
“We assessed stories on their originality, investigation, research effort and persistence. Depth of knowledge on the subject was also key in as far as it added clarity and influenced change in the community.” Related posts:
