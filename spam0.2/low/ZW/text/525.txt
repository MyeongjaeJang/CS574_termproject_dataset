Shabanie Mine coach Takesure Chiragwi feels his courage to tinker around with the team in the last minutes of the match salvaged a precious point against giants Dynamos on Sunday. 
The Glamour Boys were leading by three goals, and Shabanie managed to launch a come back in the last 20 minutes of the game courtesy of Richard Kawondera’s strike and a brace from David Temwanjira. 
“At times in football, you need to take a risk. It’s not final until the referee has blown to end the match, otherwise, we kept on believing and God answers us,” said Chiragwi in a post-match interview. 
“I also need to applaud the players because it’s never easy to score three goals against a team like Dynamos. They showed a lot of determination. I kept on encouraging the boys to keep the fight. 
“I am one of the happiest men on earth because I took a risk, and it paid well according to strategy. We don’t want to fight relegation again this year,” added Chiragwi. Share this:
