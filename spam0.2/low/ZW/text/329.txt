Harare City duo return to training 
Soccer24 on 23 Mar, 2018 
Harare City captain Tendai Samanja and midfielder Malvin Gaki have resumed training after missing the opening match-day fixture against CAPS United last weekend, the club has confirmed. 
Samanja has been on the sidelines since last year after picking up an injury while Gaki has not trained for the past two weeks. 
However, the duo remains doubtful ahead of their weekendâ€™s tie against Bulawayo City at Rufaro Stadium on Saturday. The Sunshine Boys coach Mark Harrison feels the players need some time to get into the shape. 
Meanwhile, striker Jerry Chipangura did not train today because of an elbow injury. Share this:
