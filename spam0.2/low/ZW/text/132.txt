'Mugabe to vote MDC-T,' claims Chamisa Published: 21 March 2018 MDC-T leader Nelson Chamisa has said former President Robert Mugabe was likely vote for him in the forthcoming general elections expected in July as the 94-year-old veteran politician has openly shown his disdain of his successor, President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the ruling Zanu-PF party for forcing him out of power.In an interview with Sabc News recently, Chamisa said given the animosity between Mnangagwa and Mugabe, the former veteran leader was bound to vote against his erstwhile comrades."It's a curse for country and a nation for such an elderly man in our country to be so angry, so we must be able to go and deal with that anger. I hope ED (President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa) will be mature enough to try and engage him and hear what his views are," Chamisa said."He has his issues. I think as a former President and as a liberation icon, I feel for him because there are certain things he feels betrayed. And betrayal is not good in leadership. But again he has done his bit; he must allow us to move forward. But the good news for you is that, for the first time in the history of this country President Mugabe is not going to vote for Zanu-PF, not only that, President Mugabe is going to vote for the opposition. And of course, the big question is the jury is still out, which opposition, I suspect he's going to vote for the MDC."Chamisa's utterances came amid speculation that he intended to meet Mugabe for his support in the forthcoming election. But the youthful MDC-T leader denied the allegations.Mugabe, who was ousted in November, last year, in a military intervention, was now working at cross-purpose with his former top lieutenants whom he accused of betrayal.He recently hinted that he would not vote for Zanu-PF if Mnangagwa ignored his offer for dialogue to resolve a dispute that arose during the veteran politician's ouster by the military.Mugabe distanced himself from the Ambrose Mutinhiri-led National Patriotic Front, composed of former members of Zanu-PF's G40 faction, but indicated he would support the opposition party if it promoted the ruling party's values and ideology which he said were now being abrogated. - newsday
