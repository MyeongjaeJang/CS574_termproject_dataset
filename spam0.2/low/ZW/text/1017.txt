Minister Kazembe wants Peak Mine upgraded Published: 02 April 2018 Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Minister Raymond Kazembe has said Government will engage stakeholders with the view of upgrading Peak Mine Stadium in Shurugwi to meet international standards.Peak Mine Stadium is a multipurpose sports facility which can host football, cycling and athletics among other sport codes but years of neglect of the stadia which is owned by Zimasco have resulted in the facility becoming an eyesore.This resulted in the Zifa First Instance Board condemning the facility from hosting PSL matches forcing newly promoted premiership side Nichrut to use Ascot Stadium in Gweru.Speaking at the ground-breaking ceremony for the construction of a multi-purpose sports complex at Chachacha Business Centre in Shurugwi last week, Minister Kazembe said the stadium should reclaim its former glory and become a world class facility."I had a meeting with PSL officials where I met representatives from Nichrut Football Club which was recently promoted in the league but told us they could not host PSL matches there because the stadium is not up to standard," said Minister Kazembe."We are going to discuss with various stakeholders so that Nichrut can host premiership matches."We want the stadium to become a world class facility so that it can be host to various games. In that regard we will meet with Zimasco as the owners of the stadium together with the Local Government ministry on how best we can rehabilitate the facility," he added.Meanwhile, Minister Kazembe has said the Government's Community Sport and Recreation Club System will benefit various groups by stimulating mass participation in sport, arts and recreation."Through this strategy, the Government is rolling out the Community Sport and Recreation Club System, a programme that will reach all communities in Zimbabwe including the previously disadvantaged rural communities," he said."The vision of decentralising sport, arts and recreation facilities is an operative platform for stimulating mass participation in sport, arts and recreation by all people including youths, women, persons with disabilities and the elderly," added Minister Kazembe. - zimpapers
