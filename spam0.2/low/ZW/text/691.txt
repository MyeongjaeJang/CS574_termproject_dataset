Mudehwe faces long spell on the sidelines

FC Platinum winger Marshal Mudehwe will be out of action for at least four weeks due to injury. 
Mudehwe who scored against Yadah over the weekend suffered a hamstring injury during the encounter and had to be stretchered off in the second half. 
Stand-in coach Lizwe Sweswe told NewsDay that the 24-year-old’s absence is a huge setback for his side. 
“It is definitely a big blow for us as a team because he was on fire,” Sweswe said. 
“This injury came at a time when we didn’t expect, but I hope he will be back to play in no time.” Share this:
