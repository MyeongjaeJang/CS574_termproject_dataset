In a pair of ripped denims, a tucked-in bright round neck t-shirt, hair tied in a simple and neat ponytail and a pair of white sneakers, Rani Mukerji looks far from turning 40. 
As she entered a new decade of life on last Wednesday, the actress, who is coming back to the big screen after a hiatus of four years with Hichki, says she hopes to do more movies and wants to cherish the foundation years of her two-year-old daughter Adira with husband and filmmaker Aditya Chopra. 
“I want to treat my 40 as my 20. And I want to do a lot of work… more and more movies. I want to enjoy bringing up Adira. It is going to be the most important years of her life, so I think it’s going to be a really really nice decade,” Rani told IANS while she was here to promote Hichki. 
The movie, directed by Siddharth P. Malhotra, is about Naina Mathur, who has a nervous system disorder, Tourette syndrome, forces an individual to make involuntary repetitive movements or sounds. 
The film’s narrative focuses on turning disadvantages into opportunities. In a way, it takes forward Rani’s knack for taking up roles which let the story take forefront over her stardom. “For me, it is important that the audience connects with the story or storyline, and when they connect with it, they connect with me and the character as well,” she said. 
In the past decade, Rani’s filmography is mostly laced by projects like Dil Bole Hadippa!, No One Killed Jessica, Aiyyaa and Mardaani, where the woman carries the most weight of the film on her shoulders — a rare but gradually visible shift in Indian cinema. Recent Updates
