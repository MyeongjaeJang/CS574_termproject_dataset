BNP demands army deployment in city polls Published on: 7:13   Politics   
BNP has demanded the deployment of army and the cancellation of the Election Commission’s decision to use Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in Gazipur and Khulna city polls, UNB reports. 

“Though the voters have no interest in EVMs, the Election Commission has announced to use that in many centres in the two city polls. We think the Commission’s decision has reflected the government’s will,” said BNP senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi on Sunday. 

Speaking at a discussion, he further said, “I, on behalf of BNP, demand the Election Commission deploy army and withdraw its decision of using EVMs in the two city polls.” 

Justifying their party’s demand for army deployment, the BNP leader said, the voters have no confidence in law enforcers as they are now working as the government’s party force. 

He also alleged that the Election Commission still could not ensure any sign of level-playing field in the election areas of the two cities. 

“The ruling party cadres are roaming around brandishing arms. 
Their leaders and activists are holding rallies and bringing out processions in the election areas while BNP leaders and followers can’t stay at their homes, let alone holding meetings,” the BNP leader said. 

He urged the Election Commission to ensure a level-playing field in the two cities and take steps to stop the arrest of BNP leaders and activists and repression on them. 

Last week, Chief Election Commissioner KM Nurul Huda announced that the elections to Gazipur and Khulna city corporations will be held on May 15. 

According to the election schedule, the deadline for the submission of nomination papers is April 12, while the dates for scrutinising those are April 15 and 16, and the last date for withdrawal of candidature is April 23. 

BNP candidates Moni and Prof Mannan were elected mayors in Khulna and Gazipur polls respectively in the 2013 polls. Recent Updates
