Top leaders of the BNP-led 20-party alliance are going to sit in a meeting on Saturday to discuss the country’s latest political situation and work out its next course of action. The meeting is scheduled to begin at BNP chairperson’s Gulshan office at 7:00pm, said Khaleda Zia’s media wing member Sayrul Kabir Khan. A top leader of the alliance, wishing anonymity, said the 20-party leaders are expected to discuss the country’s overall situation, organisational issues and upcoming city polls, and devise its future course of action. It will be the second meeting of the alliance leaders since BNP chief Khaleda was put in jail after being convicted in the Zia Orphanage Trust graft case. Three days after she went to jail, the top leaders of the 20-party alliance had a meeting with the BNP standing committee members on February 11 where they expressed solidarity with BNP’s programmes for unconditional release of its chairperson.
