The young man who attempted murdering Professor Zafar Iqbal some weeks ago has reportedly told investigators that several other people were involved in the attempt. For those of us who have closely been monitoring militant activities in the country through the prism of journalism, there has never been the slightest doubt that besides Foyzur Rahman Faizul there were others definitely involved in the conspiracy. What must now happen is for the law enforcers and other security forces to go firmly into the job of weeding out the elements who not only planned the attack on Zafar Iqbal but may also be engaged in planning new conspiracies for the future. The truth is that these elements who go about killing people in the name of faith are still out there and it will therefore not be wise for us to suppose that everything is under control. 

The operations against militancy we have been witnessing in recent times impress us in a way, of course. The dangers to which these men out to kill exposed us to with their behaviour, demonstrated through the murder of bloggers, writers, foreigners and others, have seemingly or for the time being declined. But that decline, it now appears, has not been enough. The attack on Zafar Iqbal shows that these killers, led astray by twisted ideas of faith, are yet lurking in the bushes and can strike any time. That is where the danger lies, or persists. Faizul has fortunately been caught, but one would like to know who else was there with him on that day and where they have disappeared. Besides, such criminal acts cannot be the brainchild of young men like Faizul alone. There are the patrons of terror and they are scattered all over the country. The state machinery needs to go after them with speed and a sense of purpose. At the same time, it has become hugely important for madrasas of all categories to be brought under the scanner. The education they impart to their pupils calls for strict surveillance.
