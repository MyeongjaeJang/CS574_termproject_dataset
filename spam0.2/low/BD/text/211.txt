Bipasha Basu says she plans to use technology to impart knowledge about health and fitness. “Soon, I will be imparting more knowledge to people who want to get fit. It will be in the digital world, because DVDs don’t really matter anymore,” Bipasha Basu said in an interview. 
“It will be a regular stream of information on one solid platform. It won’t only be about my regimens, but also about what different people need to do. It will not only cover workouts [but other fitness-related details too]; everything that’s good for the human body,” she added. Recent Updates
