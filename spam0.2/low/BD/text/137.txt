Health and Family Welfare Minister Mohammad Nasim on Thursday assured college student Rajib Hasan, who lost his right arm after having pressed between two buses, of giving a government job, reports UNB. 
The minister visited him at the Dhaka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) at noon. 
“The incident is very unfortunate, he earlier had lost his parents and now he’s an orphan who has two siblings. We’ll take all necessary steps considering Rajib’s condition. After his recovery, I’ll manage a job for him in the ministry,” he told reporters after visiting the ill-fated youth at the hospital. 
Replying to a question from a journalist about the Tk 1,26,000 bill of Samorita Hospital, Nasim said, “We’ll investigate the matter and pay the bills. We’ll also consult doctors whether Rajib could use an artificial hand.” 
Meanwhile, Prof Dr Shamsuzzaman Shahin, head of DMCH Orthopedic Department and chief of a 7-member medical board, said, “Rajib has an injury in his head while his severed hand needs more surgeries. He’s not out of danger yet.” 
Earlier on Tuesday, Rajib Hasan, a 2nd year student of Govt Titumir College, was going to his college by a double-decker Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BTRC) bus. He was standing on the rear gate dangling his right hand outside as the bus was overcrowded. 
When the bus got stranded at the Sonargaon crossing near Panthakunja park, a ‘Sajan Paribahan’ bus tried to make its way through the narrow space on between the BRTC bus and the footpath. Rajib’s right hand was pressed in between the two buses and got severed from the elbow. 
Being rescued, the victim was taken to MH Samorita Hospital at Panthapath. Recent Updates
