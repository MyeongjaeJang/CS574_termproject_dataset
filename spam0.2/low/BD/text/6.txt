Sarah Hyland had opened up last year about how her health contributes to her thin figure, and also revealed that she gets skinny shamed, and is slapped with comments like “eat something” all the time. 
Recently, the Modern Family star condemned fans who commented on her skinny appearance at an event. Now, she opened up to People.com about how she is always going to call them out! “For me it’s just kind of like a natural reaction,” Sarah said, adding, “Sometimes it gets too much to where I’m like, okay, I really need to make a statement right now because what is happening is not okay.” Recent Updates
