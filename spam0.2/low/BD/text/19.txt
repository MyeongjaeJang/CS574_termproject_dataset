Before she played the antagonist in Gulaab Gang and impressed movie goers, Juhi Chawla had won hearts in the film industry with bubbly, girl-next-door roles during the 1990s. The veteran actress has said she thought of herself as “the best villain ever”, but found it strange that movie makers did not approach her for more such roles. 
“After Gulaab Gang, believe me, I thought I was the best villain ever! I had such a fun time portraying that role that I would have loved to do some more of that but strangely not many people came after that to say let’s do something black like that,” Juhi said. 
Known for her work in films like Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, Bol Radha Bol, Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke, Darr, Ishq and My Brother Nikhil, Juhi tried to give a twist to her work portfolio by essaying a negative role as a corrupt and cold politician in Gulaab Gang. 
Her work was widely appreciated and her performance earned rave reviews with many critics calling it her career’s best performance. Now, the 50-year-old, who is the ambassador of the first edition of the Women of India Organic Festival, says she is playing a character close to it in a yet-untitled film where she is essaying a dark grey character.
