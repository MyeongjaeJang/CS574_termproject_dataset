Bangladesh and India will now be able to send and receive containerised goods through railway as trial run of first container train from India to Bangladesh was flagged off on Tuesday (Apr 3). The trial run of the first container train from Kolkata to Bangabandhusetu West station was flagged off from Majerhat station, Kolkata by the General Manager, Eastern Railways, Government of India, and the CMD of Container Corporation of India Limited (CONCOR). 
The train will enter Bangladesh through Gede/Darshana border and will terminate at Bangabandhu Shetu West Station on Wednesday where it will be received by senior officials of the Bangladesh Railway. 
This is in pursuant to the signing of a MoU between the CONCOR and Container Company of Bangladesh Limited (CCBL) for starting the container services between the two countries during the visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to India in April 2017. 
Transportation of goods through container trains is likely to be a faster and cheaper option for both India and Bangladesh, said the Indian High Commission in Dhaka.
