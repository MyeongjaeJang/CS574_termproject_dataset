Rapper Logic and Jessica Andrea split! Published on: 12:35   

Logic and his wife Jessica Andrea, social media star and singer, have split after two years of marriage, reports TMZ.com. 
Although neither of the two have filed for divorce yet, the outlet says that it is not far away as there are no signs of reconciliation. Fans first noticed trouble brewing between the two when Jessica unfollowed Logic on Instagram. 
But the case looks even more serious now, as sources say that the home they purchased together last year is about to go on sale. 
The news comes as quite a shocker as just a month ago, they seemed to set major couple goals while attending the Grammy Awards, where Logic was nominated for Song of the Year for 1-800-273-8255. It is unclear exactly when the couple decided to part ways. Recent Updates
