Brexit: A Tale of Two Establishment Stitch Ups 

Many of the spokespeople for Euroscepticism like to talk about representing “ordinary, decent people”. They are the so-called “bad boys” who dared to stand up to the elites. Speaking at a Trump rally last year, Nigel Farage claimed, “we made June 23 our independence day when we smashed the establishment.” 

This is patent nonsense. Both campaigns, Leave and Remain, were masterminded by elites – and the actual voting demographics dismantle the cliché that poor people in the North voted for Brexit, while rich people in the South East shunned it. As my colleague Adam Ramsay reports in his excellent analysis of the pro-Leave campaign, Veterans for Britain; “Brexit was as Establishment England as they come”. 

And yet this myth – of the plucky, brave underdogs who started a revolution to take their country back – is a highly convenient one. Particularly when journalists start asking awkward questions. Easier to write off Carole Cadwalladr at the Observer as a sore loser than to answer questions about AggregrateIQ, the Cambridge Analytica-linked firm that, mysteriously, no one in any Leave camp can remember much about – despite collectively shelling out millions for their services. (Here’s Adam Ramsay and Peter Geoghegan putting this awkward question to DUP’s Brexit campaign manager, Jeffrey Donaldson, in May last year. Here’s Adam and Peter tracking down the obscure branding agency they all used, headquartered in an empty semi-detached house in Ely). 

Easier, too, to throw around vague, anti-Semitic tropes about George Soros than to come clean about where the Brexit campaign cash came from, after openDemocracy’s reporting triggered questions in parliament about the role of dark money in the EU referendum – and the concerns about foreign and particularly Russian interference in western democracies.
