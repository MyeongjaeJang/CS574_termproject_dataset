Who’s running country? Questions Fakhrul Published on: 7:36 pm - Thursday | April 5, 2018 Exclusive / Features / Politics   
Expressing his doubt, BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Thursday questioned if the country is being run by Awami League or ‘any other element.’ 
“Sometime I doubt, is Awami League really running the country, or any other element? The party which had fought for democracy and caretaker government, cannot run the country such a way,”he said. 
Fakhrul said this while talking to reporters at BNP’s Nayapaltan central office. 
He alleged that the government is pushing for an undemocratic system in the name of democracy. 
Terming the Election Commission (EC) and the Anti Corruption Commission (ACC) power-less, the senior BNP leader said,” The EC and the ACC are working as per the government’s instruction. The ACC brought allegations against some BNP leaders of mysterious transaction in banks. But, some the leaders have no accounts in those banks at all.” Recent Updates
