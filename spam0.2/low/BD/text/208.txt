BNP Senior Secretary General Ruhul Kabir Rizvi Ahmed has alleged that the party’s Chairperson is not being given proper treatment although she was seriously ill in the jail. 
“Khaleda Zia was put into jail in a planned way. But, now, she is being deprived of proper treatment. It’s a part of a multi-faced conspiracy to destroy the nationalist forces,” he said. 
Rizvi came up with the comment at a press conference held at BNP Central office at Nayapaltan in Dhaka on Sunday. 
Alleging that the medical board only recommended blood test, X-ray and physiotherapy for her treatment, the senior BNP leader also said, “The elderly leader who has long been suffering from knee pain and eye problem, was kept in an unhygienic environment that created many other complications.” 
Although Khaleda’s personal physicians were called in the BSMMU during her physical examinations, they were not allowed to give her treatment or advise, Rizvi also alleged further. 
Calling upon the authorities to ensure proper treatment of Khaleda Zia as per her decision, he demanded immediate release of the party chief. Recent Updates
