Kate Hudson’s fan goes kooky as the actress revealed that she is pregnant with a baby girl, with her boyfriend Danny Fujikawa. 
The star took to Instagram on Saturday to post a gender reveal party video that showcases a baby bump, while she and her family pop balloons that contain smaller pink balloons and pink confetti. 
The ‘Almost Famous’ actress wrote alongside, “SURPRISE!!! If you’ve wondered why I’ve been so absent on my social channels it’s because I have never been more sick! It was the most sick first trimester of all my children.
