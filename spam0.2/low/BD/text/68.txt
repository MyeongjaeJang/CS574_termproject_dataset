Russian President Vladimir Putin is trying to divide Britain from its allies, according t o Britain’s defense secretary. Gavin Williamson, who is in Tallinn, Estonia, said the world’s patience was wearing thin with Putin and his actions.He said the world was united behind the British, in a “powerful message to the Kremlin”. 
The Russian government hit back, saying Britain’s accusations over the nerve agent attack on a former spy in Salisbury “border on banditry”, reports Sky News. Williamson said the universal backing for Britain was in “itself a defeat for President Putin”. 
“The world’s patience is rather wearing thin with President Putin and his actions, and the fact that right across the NATO alliance, right across the European Union, nations have stood up in support of the United Kingdom… I actually think that is the very best response that we could have,” he said. 
“Their (the Kremlin’s) intention, their aim is to divide and what we are seeing is the world uniting behind the British stance and that in itself is a great victory and sends an exceptionally powerful message to the Kremlin and President Putin.” 
Williamson arrived in the Estonian capital on Sunday for a two-day visit to see British troops who are based there as part of a NATO mission in the Baltic states to deter Russian aggression. 
He addressed the troops with his Estonian counterpart, Juri Luik, who said Estonia was prepared to stand by the UK just as the UK had stood by his country. Williamson has been vociferous in speaking about Russian involvement in the attack on double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia on 4 March. 
Earlier this month he said Russia should “go away and shut up” when asked how the Kremlin should respond to 23 of its diplomats, thought to be spies, being expelled from the UK over the poisoning. Recent Updates
