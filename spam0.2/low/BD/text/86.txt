One of the 47 torch bearers 

Ok, now here is the question. How many full blooded English person do you know who wants to be a Bangladeshi? He wants to be one but it just hasn’t happened yet. Why? well, you know how things are when the Government is involved and they do take their time deciding things. 

How long will that take one can’t say. His health has not been the best for a while so this citizenship award if given a little more quickly might really make us all of us feel rather good. 

Now where did I hear that he was one of those 47 torch bearers at the Shaheed Minar on March 26 this year. Those selected to be so were the finest of Bangladshis and Julian was there. In fact, by doing so he joins the most honourable elite of our time selected to bear the torch that is sacred not because it bears a symbol of any religion but because its anointed by history.
