Bangladesh Cricket team returned home from Sri Lanka on Monday after losing to India by four wickets in the last-ball thriller in the final of the Nidahas Trophy tri-nation T20I cricket at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo Sunday night. The Tigers were once again deprived of an international trophy from a winning position as Bangladeshi occasional bowler Soumya Sarkar conceded six runs in the last ball of the match maintaining their losing record against India in the shorter version of the cricket. India chased down a target of 167 runs scoring 168 for 6 in 20 overs as Dinesh Karthik made a tough task of hitting six over extra cover in the last ball of the match, taken by Soumya Sarkar. In the double league basis tri-nation T20 cricket arranged on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Sri Lankan independence, Bangladesh stormed the final eliminating hosts Sri Lanka from the title race beating them twice. The Tigers beat the hosts in the first match with their highest chase record of 215 runs riding on the outstanding performance of Mushfiqur Rahim while they reached the final to the frustration of the hosts beating the Islanders also in the last-ball thriller by Mahmudullah, who assured victory hitting a six in the penultimate ball of the match. But, Bangladesh finished runners-up losing all the three matches against neighbouring India including the final. Bangladesh Cricket team left Dhaka for Colombo on March 4 to participate in the tri-nation Nidahas Trophy T20I tournament. Recent Updates
