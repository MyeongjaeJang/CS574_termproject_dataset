Spice Girls ‘to star’ in animated superhero movie Published on: 11:13   

The first officially official new Spice Girls project is taking off: Variety reports all five girls have signed off on voicing characters designed in their likeness for a superhero-themed “girl power” movie. 
The project is being shopped to potential production partners at this point. Not much has been reported on the plot yet (and whether it’ll be more for kids or adults), but each character will have a super girl power inspired by the actual girls’ real-life personalities. 
While Victoria Beckham (Posh Spice), Melanie Brown (Scary Spice), Emma Bunton (Baby Spice), Melanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice) and Geri Halliwell (Ginger Spice) have been less (wholly) committal to a big reunion tour, the group is “fired up about the idea of the animated film,” a source told Variety. 
“The Spice Girls are thinking big in terms of a franchise on a global scale. They’re the most successful girl group on the planet. It’s just what Marvel or Disney needs.” 
The girls’ last big movie was their live-action 1997 Spice World, a ’90s gem with plenty for the animated film to pull inspiration from. Recent Updates
