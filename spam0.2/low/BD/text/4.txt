‘I will be victim’s voice if needed’ Published on: 12:39   

While the leading ladies of Hollywood have raised their voice against sexual abuse and sparked off a global movement, artistes in India continue to shy away from the topic. The fear of getting sidelined in the industry apart, leading actors have also stated that pointing fingers at men in an industry that idolises the hero, is difficult. 
However, Neha Dhupia opines that the Hindi film industry’s silence has little to do with these elements. “If I had to raise my voice, I would. I want to tell every woman that if there is someone going through any of this, and if I need to be her voice, I’m willing to do it. 
If somebody is scared to talk, they should call me. I would love to help,” says the actor. She says they can get in touch with her over social media. “If you’re encountering abuse, or someone is forcing themselves on you, you can write to me.” Recent Updates
