Rucha Pathak, Chief Creative Officer, said, “Mukesh called me out of the blue one day to meet her… and she had a striking and yet innocent personality but what really caught my attention was when Mukesh screen tested her. 
She nailed it in her audition and we knew right away she was our leading lady. We’re now looking forward to launching this talented young lady in Mukesh’s directorial debut.” Recent Updates
