Bangla Academy Moshari Lecture Series 

Bangla Academy has announced a Moshari lecture series named as the Mayor of Dhaka commemorative event. The Academy has announced that the rise in the number of mosharis in various academic institutions led them to explore the matter and they found that mosharis have a long history in Bengal and Bangla. 

The DG said that, “In fact, our Gurudev himself used to hang a moshari and he wrote some of his masterpieces while sitting under them. So the contribution of mosharis to Bangla literature can’t be underestimated. It has been speculated that the song “ amar jamar majhe likiye chiley dekhte ami paini “ was written on a mosha but later after hanging the moshari, the words were changed and a more profound angle added.“
