Today is the 86th birth anniversary of the Ekushey Padak winning artist Rashid Chowdhury, who introduced and popularised tapestry as a fine art form in Bangladesh. He was a brilliant artist, sculpture, writer and fine art professor at Chittagong University. He played a major role in the progress of art movements in 1950s and improvement of the art-related educational institutions. Chowdhury was the pioneer of tapestry in this country and definitely the finest artist of this particular genre to date. He successfully introduced tapestry in various forms. His works are unparalleled in their subjects and uniqueness. Born in the village of Haroa, under Faridpur district, on April 1, 1932, Chowdhury completed his five-year course in fine arts from the then Dacca Art College (now Dhaka University’s faculty of fine arts) in 1954 and attended a teachers’ training certificate course at Asutosh Museum of the Calcutta University. He did his post-graduate studies under a Spanish government scholarship, and studied sculpture at the Central Escula des Bellias Artes de San Fernando in Madrid from 1956 to ‘57. He also studied sculpture, fresco and tapestry at the Academy of Jullian and Beaux Arts in Paris from 1960 to ‘64. Following his study in Paris, he became more interested in tapestry and developed a unique style in terms of design and colour composition. Chowdhury received the first prize on fresco painting in Beaux Arts in Paris (1962) and first prize in RCD Biennale in Tehran (1967). He also received Ekushey Padak and the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy Award. Recent Updates
