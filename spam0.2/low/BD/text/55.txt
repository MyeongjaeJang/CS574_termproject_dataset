Ronaldo scores twice as Portugal beat Egypt 2-1 Published on: 11:16   
Cristiano Ronaldo scored with two stoppage-time headers and lifted Portugal to a stunning 2-1 win over Mohamed Salah-inspired Egypt in a friendly between World Cup-bound teams Friday.Salah seemed to have won the game with a 56th-minute shot worthy of his fast-rising star status from the edge of the Portugal penalty area. But one superstar was still on the field after Salah was substituted to a loud ovation in the 79th from fans in neutral Zurich. Ronaldo first rose unchallenged to score from Ricardo Quaresma’s left-flank cross in the second minute of time added on. Two minutes later, Ronaldo powered a header low into the right corner of the goal from Quaresma’s free kick on the right. The winning goal was confirmed 90 seconds later after a video review for a possible offside. Ronaldo came closest to scoring in the first half after Portugal was awarded a free kick when goalkeeper Mohamed El-Shenawy picked up a backpass. His shot from near the penalty spot beat the defensive wall then was blocked by the leg of Abdallah Said standing in the middle of the goal.Salah struck with a classy goal early in the second half, collecting the ball 20 meters from the goal before spreading a pass to the left side of the area. -AP, Zurich
