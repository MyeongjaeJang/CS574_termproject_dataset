Terming Facebook a ‘dangerous’ tool, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s ICT Adviser also her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy said that he likes to call the Facebook as ‘a book of fake things’ which is uncontrollable. 
“Facebook is dangerous. Many people use this social communication media. My wife Christina checks (her) Facebook within short intervals. I like to call it a ‘fake book’. It’s an imaginary and pseudo sphere. It has no bound. It is not controllable and also beyond blocking,” he said. 
Joy, as the chief guest, was addressing the inauguration program of two-day long Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) Summit 2018 at a city hotel Sunday (April 15). 
“Nothing can be intercepted on internet by blocking. You too won’t want to block” 
“The whole world including the United States is facing propaganda on Facebook. None can control it. We are taking steps. Another initiative is being taken to provide training on to see how the black-listed contents or the contents used to spread propaganda can be blocked. These will be blocked. Because, these are used to instigate torture on the minorities, and incitement given for turning the situation unstable too,” added Joy. 
Expressing the opinion on Facebook is everyone’s freedom of speech. But it is not right to incite something through it. Our government has completed the making of digital security law draft. Freedom of speech of anyone isn’t being shoved through it. 
“Objective of this law is to ensure security of minorities and resisting provocation,” he said further. 
Telecom and ICT Minister Mustafa Jabbar, State Minister for ICT ICT State Minister Junaid Ahmed Palak, President of Parliamentary Standing Committee on Post, Telecommunication and Information Technology Imran Ahmed MP, President of Bangladesh Association of Call Center and Outsourcing (BACCO) Wahidur Rahman Sharif were among others address the program.
