E-commerce still not picking up mainstream popularity 

A 4-day art camp was held by Gallery Cosmos in Chattogram’s Finlay Hills, where 13 of the country’s eminent artists participated to produce stellar artworks away from the machinations of urban life. 
It is part of Gallery Cosmos’ continuous endeavours in elevating Bangladeshi art through the organising of such frequent art camps. They plan on holding more art camps in future, both domestically and internationally. 

Hosted at the residence of art enthusiast and entrepreneur M Tariqul Islam, the stalwart artists included Shamarjit Ray Chowdhury, Hamiduzzaman Khan, Alakesh Ghosh, Farida Zaman, Ahmed Shamsuddoha, Sheikh Afzal, Nazia Andaleeb Preema, Bishwajit Goswami, Sourav Chowdhury and Shahanoor Mamun. Guest artists included Sharbari Roy, Ivy Zaman and Zahangir Alom. 

The art camp proved to be a ground for nurturing the artists’ inner thoughts and then manifesting them into stellar artworks. Alakesh Ghosh, for example, painted a couple of flowers on canvas, using his trademark forte of water colour. Hamiduzzaman Khan paid homage to the 1971 martyrs in his artworks, Bishwajit Goswami chose the theme of motherhood and so on. 

The derived artworks will soon be up for exhibition at Gallery Cosmos. Leave a Reply
