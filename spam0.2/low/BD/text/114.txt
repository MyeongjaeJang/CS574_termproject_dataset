Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone may tie the knot by the end of 2018. There are talks on these lines about DeepVeer — the B-Town’s most admirable lovebirds. 

According to a report in Mumbai Mirror, the couple is likely set to tie the knot sometime between September and December. 

After the release of Padmaavat, the families of both the actors met each other at Ranveer’s Bandra residence, where the two families reportedly discussed about the marriage. 

The reports also claim that the two families exchanged pre-wedding gifts and jewellery, including a Sabyasachi saree for Deepika. 

The marriage will be a low-key affair in the presence of family members and close friends. 

“It will be an extremely private, traditional Hindu ceremony with the couple tying the knot in the presence of only close friends and family. 
The couple is still deciding if they want a reception to follow,” a source close to the families revealed to Mumbai Mirror. 

Deepika, who was last seen in Padmaavat alongside Ranveer, is reportedly on a shopping spree for the marriage with her sister Anshika Padukone as she has taken time off from work. 

The couple has been in a relationship for more than five years now and the rumours of their love story started to blossom on the sets of their first film Golyioun Ki Rasleela Ram Leela. 

Besides Ram Leela, DeepVeer has worked together in films like Bajirao Mastani and Padmaavat. Recent Updates
