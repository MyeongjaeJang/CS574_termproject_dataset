Ibra’s MLS debut ‘possibly’ as soon as Saturday Published on: 4:11 pm - Friday | March 30, 2018 


Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s Major League Soccer debut for the Los Angeles Galaxy could come as soon as Saturday, said Galaxy manager Sigi Schmid who described the Swede as ‘not a normal, mortal human’. The Swedish star won’t arrive in Southern California until Thursday night and is due to meet his new teammates on Friday morning. But Schmid didn’t rule out the possibility that he’d be ready to play a role on Saturday when the Galaxy take on their new cross-town rivals Los Angeles Football Club, at StubHub Center in suburban Carson. ‘You’re talking about Zlatan Ibrahimovic,’ Schmid said in comments posted on the team’s website. ‘You’re not talking about a normal, mortal human. I’m sure he’ll tell you the same. ‘He’s a competitor. He loves to compete and he loves challenges. If you ask me is he 90 minutes fit for Saturday, no. But will he play a role in the game? Quite possibly.’ Recent Updates
