Ever since Bollywood director Karan Johar unveiled the first look poster of Student of The Year 2 featuring Tiger Shroff, fans have been anxiously waiting for the announcement of the two female leads. And living by their promise, the makers have now introduced the newest entrant to Karan Johar’s uber cool school – Tara Sutaria, says Indian Express. 
In a new poster posted by Dharma Productions, Tara can be seen sporting a denim look with a sketch of a school corridor in the background. Another poster featuring Tiger Shroff’s hunky avatar was also released by the makers today. While the previous SOTY installment was directed by producer Karan Johar, SOTY 2 will be helmed by Punit Malhotra. The team will announce the second lead for the film today, reports the Indian Express. 
Debutante Tara has been a VJ with Disney and has also featured in a number of Disney shows including Best of Luck Nikki and others. She is also a professional dancer and singer and has sung songs for acclaimed films such as Taare Zameen Par, Guzaarish and David. 
Previously, there were rumours that Chunky Pandey’s daughter Ananya Pandey has been roped in for the film. Even though Sara Ali Khan and Janhvi Kapoor’s names have cropped up at times, reports have suggested that Pandey has had the upper hand. The second lead is yet to be announced and it could very well be Ananya Pandey. Student of the Year 2 will hit the theatres on November 23 this year. Recent Updates
