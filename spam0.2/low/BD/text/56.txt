An emotional journey of a freedom fighter Published on: 11:15   

Theatre Art Unit staged its much-acclaimed production titled ‘Somoyer Proyojone’ yesterday at the National Theater Hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA). Dramatized and directed by Mohammad Bari, the production is based on a short story by Zahir Raihan. 
Zahir Raihan wrote the story in the year 1971. The story of the drama revolves around a freedom fighter. His experience and the emotional journey bring back the horrific situation of Liberation War. 
About the play, director Bari said, “Although all the characters are fictional, the events the play depicts are factual and documented truth. It is not a single story; a series of events reveals how the freedom fighters went through in that long nine months of battle. The whole play brings a documentary feeling on the stage.” 
Just as Zahir Raihan is physically present in the story and gives a first person narration, he does the same in the play. The original words of the author have been used for the dialogues of Zahir Raihan in the script and that of the freedom fighter Mamun. 
In the play, Mohammad Bari will appear as Zahir Raihan. The other important casts of the play includes Prashanta Halder, Selim Mahbub, Saif Suman, Ferdous Amin Biplob and others. Recent Updates
