Actress Prachi Desai, who has completed a decade in the Hindi film industry, says Bollywood does give due and credit to everyone at some point. 
Asked if she ever feels that her talent has not been explored as much, Prachi told IANS in an e-mail interaction: “I don’t know about how long it’s been but I always look at every project to be the beginning. 
This industry does give everyone their due and credit at some point and I am grateful for what I have got, though I would say it’s just the beginning.” 
Prachi made her Bollywood debut in 2008 with Rock On!! and ever since then has featured in films like Life Partner, Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai, Teri Meri Kahaani, Bol Bachchan, I, Me Aur Main, Azhar and Rock On 2. In a decade-long-journey, Prachi has never played a title role in any film so far. Recent Updates
