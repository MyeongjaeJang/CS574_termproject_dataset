Britney Spears’ ex asking for more child support Published on: 2:48   


Singer Britney Spears’ father Jamie Spears is reportedly upset with his daughter’s former husband Kevin Federline, who called him pleading for more child support. Federline has been pulling in $20,000 a month for child support for years, but he now says it’s not enough. 
Sources told tmz.com that last Friday, Federline called Jamie and said he was in a financial bind and wanted to talk about raising his child support. Jamie was suspicious and asked Federline where the $20,000 was going. Sources said last week Jamie got a letter from Federline’s lawyer, asking him if they could sit down and talk. Recent Updates
