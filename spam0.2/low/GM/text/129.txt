The Office of the IGP has urged for the cooperation of the public, in providing timely information that would help in their drive. 
“Policing is a collective responsibility and all are urged to join the fight to rid The Gambia of criminals and hoodlums,” the statement continued. 
The Gambia used to have check points across the country until the advent of the Barrow administration, when human rights advocates called on the Government to dismantle them. 
The right defenders claimed that check points affect the freedom of movement of people as well as encourages corruption. 
However, less than a year after dismantling the check points, the country has recorded an unprecedented rise of criminal activity including armed robbery, killings and increase theft both in the urban and rural areas.
