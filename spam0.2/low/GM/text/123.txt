QUESTION OF THE DAY 
This is the final phase of the 2016 â€“ 2018 electoral cycle. The mayoral/chairpersonship elections will be the climax. 302,528 voters out of total of 886,578 registered voters participated in the elections. The Independent Electoral Elections has recorded a total of 34 percent participation. This means that 66 percent did not participate. This is almost two-thirds of the registered voters.
