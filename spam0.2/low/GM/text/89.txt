Gambia Lady Scorpions Facing Burkina in Nations Cup Qualifier April 6, 2018 SHARES 
By Sulayman Bah 
It will be a litmus test affair for Gambia’s women national team outfit where a tie with Burkina Faso awaits this Saturday in a first-leg qualifier game for the Africa Cup of Nations. 
The Scorpions have prepared for this tie with a friendly game against a robust opposition in Morocco losing 2-1. 
Domestic league leading scorer Adama Tamba was Gambia’s lone goal scorer. It will be interesting how the experienced centre-forward, who recently trialed in France, will lead the Scorpions in the weekend. The West African nation’s only notable feat in the women’s game has been qualification in the U-17 World Cup in Azerbaijan six years ago. They would be looking to add to that by sealing a place in the Nations Cup but which must begin with the jettisoning of Burkina whom they face for the second-leg on 10 th April at the Bakau Independence Stadium.
