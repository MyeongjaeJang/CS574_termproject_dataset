When the case was called before Magistrate Davies Wilson, Inspector Abdoulie Bojang represented the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and the accused person appeared for himself. When the charge sheet was read to him in Court, Mr. Mendy pleaded not guilty to the single count he was charged with and that is Accessory After the Fact to Murder, contrary to section 202 of the Criminal Code of the Gambia.

The Police Prosecutor Inspector Abdoulie Bojang, applied for the Court to transfer the case to the High Court; that according to Section 5 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), the Court can hear all matters except treason; but that by virtue of the provision of Legal Notice Number 3 2009, the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the matter. He further relied on Section 62 of the CPC to back his case. The trial magistrate in her ruling, transferred the matter to the High Court that has jurisdiction to hear the case.
