Mbemba Camara, a former National Intelligence Agency Officer, has told the Banjul High Court that what he earlier described as a “thing” lying down on a mattress at the NIA, was indeed Solo Sandeng.

The accused persons in the trial are Yankuba Badjie, Louis Gomez, former Deputy Director, Saikou Omar Jeng, former director of Operations, Baboucarr Sallah, Haruna Susso, Yusupha Jammeh, Tamba Masireh, Lamin Darboe and Lamin Lang Sanyang and they are standing trial on twenty-five counts ranging from Murder, causing grievous bodily harm, accessory, conspiracy to commit felony, fraudulently preparing a death certificate, forgery, making documents without authority, fabricating evidence, disobedience to statutory authority and abduction. The witness told the court that he later knew the one lying on the mattress was Solo Sandeng after he got information from the public; that Tamba Mansireh, the 7 th accused person, was a guard security, Sheikh Omar Jeng, 3 rd accused person was Director of Operations, Lamin Darboe the 8 th accused person a Technical staff and Yusupha Jammeh, works at the NIA but doesn’t know the section where he works.
