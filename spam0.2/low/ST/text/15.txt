View our latest analysis for Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy Commentary On SGRE’s Past Performance 
For the most up-to-date info, I use the ‘latest twelve-month’ data, which either annualizes the most recent 6-month earnings update, or in some cases, the most recent annual report is already the latest available financial data. This allows me to assess various companies in a uniform manner using new information. For Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, its most recent trailing-twelve-month earnings is -€20.28M, which, against the previous year’s level, has turned from positive to negative. Since these figures are somewhat nearsighted, I’ve created an annualized five-year figure for SGRE’s earnings, which stands at €228.08M. BME:SGRE Income Statement Apr 3rd 18 We can further assess Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy’s loss by looking at what the industry has been experiencing over the past few years. Each year, for the past half a decade Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy’s top-line has grown by 45.71% on average, implying that the company is in a high-growth phase with expenses racing ahead revenues, leading to annual losses. Viewing growth from a sector-level, the ES electrical industry has been growing its average earnings by double-digit 18.56% over the previous year, and a more subdued 9.33% over the past five years. This suggests that whatever tailwind the industry is enjoying, Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy has not been able to realize the gains unlike its industry peers. What does this mean? 
While past data is useful, it doesn’t tell the whole story. Companies that incur net loss is always difficult to envisage what will happen in the future and when. The most valuable step is to assess company-specific issues Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy may be facing and whether management guidance has dependably been met in the past.
