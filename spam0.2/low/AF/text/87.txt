The incident occurred on Saturday evening in Police District 8th of Kabul city, causing casualties to the civil society members who gathered to support the Pashtun Long March in Pakistan. Meanwhile, the Patriotic Movement of Afghanistan said the terrorist attack on peaceful Kabul sit-in has been carried out by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and wowed to continue its struggle until peace and stability was not prevailed across the country. Senior leadership of the movement, during a press conference at sit-in, slammed Pakistan for conducting terrorist and destructive activities in Afghanistan and systemic slow motion genocide of ethnic Pashtun, Baloch and Hazara populations in Pakistan. A central leader of the movement, Israr Karimzai, said Afghans—across the board gathered at Kabul-sit-in to raise voice and mobilize the general masses in support of Afghan-led peace process.
