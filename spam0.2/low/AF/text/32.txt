  10:37 am) Mohammad Ishaq Rahgozar will be appointed as successor to Atta Mohammad Noor, the ousted governor of Balkh province, at an official ceremony today afternoon, officials confirmed. In addition, General Akram Sama has been appointed as the replacement of Sayed Kamal Sadat, the current provincial police chief of Balkh. This comes a day after Atta Mohammad Noor said in his Nawroz speech that his party, Jamiat-e-Islami Afghanistan, and the presidential palace have reached to an agreement on certain issues and an announcement would be made soon. Last year in December, President Ashraf Ghani’s office in a statement announced that the president has accepted Noor’s resignation as Balkh governor. Noor defied his ouster and challenged the central government that he would not step down until a list of demands by his party were met. 2018-03-22
