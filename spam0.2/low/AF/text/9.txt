Ariana News Leave a comment   19, 2018 6:13 pm) Mohammad Reza Bahrami, the Iranian Ambassador to Afghanistan says that foreign countries should not turn the war-torn Afghanistan into their rivalry hub. On Sunday, Mr. Bahrami said the increasing activities of terrorist groups in Afghanistan and in the region is alarming and added that regional countries should provide the ground for initiating peace talks between Afghan government and the Taliban insurgent group. “Overall, we are worried about the expansion of extremist and terrorist movements activities in Afghanistan and the region. I don’t want to limit this to a specific group, we are worried about any activity by extremist groups in the region,” Bahrami told Ariana News. He also denied Iran’s support for the Taliban in Afghanistan. Recently, Afghan officials in western Farah province of Afghanistan accused Iran for providing modern weapons to Taliban militants. According to officials, lack of water resources in Iran has encouraged the country’s intelligence to destabilize Farah province of Afghanistan in order to prevent the construction of Bakhshabad dam. “Insecurities increased in Farah province after reports regarding the construction of Bakhshabad dam emerged. Absolutely, our neighboring country, Iran is behind the insecurities,” Dadullah Qani, a member of Farah provincial council said. While, Mr. Bahrami, the ambassador of Iran to Afghanistan, once in an interview with Ariana News, accepted having contacts with the Taliban group for information purposes, but now rejects any support to the group. “I’m strongly rejecting, the Islamic Republic of Iran is not supporting any extremist group in Afghanistan,” Bahrami told Ariana News. “We have always emphasized that those countries which have a presence in Afghanistan should refrain from entering their disagreements into Afghanistan,” he added. “Afghanistan was supposed to be a model of cooperation between countries not a competition field.”
