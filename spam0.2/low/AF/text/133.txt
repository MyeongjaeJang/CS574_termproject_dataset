admin March 28, 2018 In Latest Updates , Nation Array AT-KABUL: Up to 7,500 people infected by AIDS syndrome have been registered in Afghanistan, the public health ministry said. “Migrations to abroad and the low level of education are the major reasons of the HIV virus spread,” said Ferozuddin Feroz, public health minister. “Thus, we need to use elite people who are influential among the nation to explain the HIV disease and its injuries.” The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has asked singer Farhad Darya to explain the disease for the people. 350 people affected by the HIV virus were registered only in 2017, according to the ministry. Farhad Darya said he was ready to “play the role of a bridge” with the people. “It is an honor for me to play a bridge between the HIV affected persons and other people in a three to five year long program.” He said it was disappointing to hear misbehavior and discrimination with the people affected by the HIV, asked the media outlets to help remove misbehavior. There are 13 HIV/AIDS treatment centers in different province and the government works to increase the centers.
