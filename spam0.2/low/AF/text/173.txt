Abdul Ahad Elbeik, a member of Faryab provincial council stated “government’s negligence and lack of support” to the forces as main motive for their alliance with the Taliban. He further said that Faryab-Jawzjan highway has become insecure recently and the Taliban have established check points across the highway. According to him, a passenger was also shot dead in recent days by the militants after he tried to escape from the Taliban checking points. However, Faryab local officials rejected that the commanders of Public Uprising Forces have joined Taliban along with their men and that they handed over 30 villages to the group in the province. Abdul Karim Soroush, spokesman of the provincial police chief just confirmed that a village in Garzivan district has been fallen to the Taliban. He added that Afghan forces will soon launch an operation to retake the area.
