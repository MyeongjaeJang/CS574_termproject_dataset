It is worth mentioning that public representatives and the government officials differed over who were killed the most in the airstrike—militants or the civilians. The senators discussed the airstrike on a seminary called Hashimia Madrasa in Dashti Archi district and asked the government to punish those involved in irresponsibly bombing. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defense (MoD) released new information regarding the deadly airstrike, in which MoD Spokesman Gen. Mohammad Radmanish shared the latest information as well as pictures of the airstrike as he was updating the media during a press conference today. Gen. Radmanish said the airstrike was carried out a main stronghold of the Taliban group in Dasht-e-Archi district which was also being used as the training camp by the group. He said the raid was conducted based on accurate intelligence information and as a result several Taliban insurgents including eighteen of their leaders were killed.
