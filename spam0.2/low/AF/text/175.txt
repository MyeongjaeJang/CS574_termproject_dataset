  Nation Array AT-KABUL: The High Peace Council has welcomed Uzbekistan’s offer for political office to Taliban, saying it would support “any country’s efforts” for durable peace in Afghanistan. Uzbekistan’s envoy for Afghanistan, Ismatullah Irgashev said Monday that Tashkent would grant a political office to Taliban with the agreement of the government of Afghanistan. He said the aim of the office was to encourage Taliban militants to the Afghan government’s peace program. The council has repeated President Ghani’s words that the government would be prepared to hold unconditional talks with the Taliban officials anywhere that the group wants. “We support any effort by any country regarding peace in Afghanistan. We are ready to provide facilities of a political office for the opposition groups either inside the country or abroad,” Sayed Ehsan Taheri, the peace council’s spokesman said Tuesday. Uzbekistan hosted last week a conference on Afghanistan in which representatives from different countries emphasized on a peaceful solution to the current problem in the war-hit country. Members of parliament praise Uzbekistan’s role in the Afghan peace program, saying that the neighboring countries especially Uzbekistan could play better role in this regard than other countries. “We support every effort that leads to peace in Afghanistan. Uzbekistan has recently got interest in the Afghan issues with hosting the Tashkent conference and offering political office to Taliban. These are appreciable,” said lawmaker, Bashir Ahmad Tahyench.
