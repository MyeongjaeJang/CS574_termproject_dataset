Opting to bat first after winning the toss, UAE were bowled out for just 177 in 43 overs, courtesy of Afghanistan’s spin sensation Rashid Khan who took 5 for 41 in his nine-over spell. Shaiman Anwar (64 off 87) was top-scorer for UAE, followed by Mohammad Naveed who made quick fire 45 of 20 balls. Chasing the target, Afghanistan struggled as they slipped to 54 for 5 in 15.1 overs. They were put under serious pressure by UAE’s new-ball bowlers, Mohammad Naveed and Qadeer Ahmed. However, a 124-run partnership between Gulbadin Naib and Najibullah Zadran repaired Afghanistan’s chase, as UAE lost their appetite for a fight on a stiflingly hot afternoon. Both men passed fifty before guiding their team home with more than 15 overs to spare. In their final match of the Super Six stage of the tournament, Afghanistan will play against Ireland on Friday.
