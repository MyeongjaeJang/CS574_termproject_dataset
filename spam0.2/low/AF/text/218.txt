Months ago, Presidential Palace (ARG) has announced that Noor had submitted his resignation and that it was approved by the president. However, Noor had refused to step down and insisted that the resignation letter was handed over during the negotiations with President Ghani as guarantee to resign once his and Jamiat’s demands were addressed by the government.
