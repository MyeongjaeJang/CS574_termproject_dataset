  AT-KABUL: The Transparent Election Foundation of Afghanistan (TEFA) has expressed its deepest concern over non-announcement of confirmed schedule of polls and the existence of barriers on this process. TEFA said the Afghan masses and political parties have been in state of unrest over the deliberately delaying of elections, security of polling stations, and lack of transparency in recruitment and non-presence of political parties in monitoring of the process. TEFA Head, Mohammad Naheem Ayub Zada in a press briefing on Monday said free and fair elections would not be possible during the ongoing year, if the Independent Election Commission (IEC) did not apply professionalism and expertise. He said the election commission should materialize its slogans of conducting transparent elections to pull the nation out of uncertainty. According to the announced schedule by the IEC, elections for the Wolesi Jirga and district councils would be held in the months of Jun or July. Responding to the concerns of TEFA, IEC member, Mahazullah Dawlati said work is in progress and schedule of polls would be announced very soon. However, Nazir Jandad, an analyst of electoral process said required steps have not yet taken by the government and the IEC. He said the IEC has much to do to conduct free and transparent elections for the Wolesi Jirga and district councils as per schedule.
