  5:44 pm) Afghan senators have urged the government to take legal action against Sayed Ishaq Gilani the head of National Solidarity Movement of Afghanistan who recently claimed that Kabul government provides context for India to interfere in Pakistan using Afghan soil. Fazl Hadi Muslimyar, the chairman of the senate house (Meshrano Jirga) said that Gilani’s remarks were against the constitution and national interest, insisting that the government should take the issue seriously. “Gilani’s remarks were against the constitution and national interest of the country. The intelligence and detective institutions should take the issue seriously and he must be punished and the president should not ignore the issue, “he said. “Gilani has not a national and public figure,” Senator Junaddin Giyanwal said. “He is the enemy of Afghanistan people and the enemies should be prosecuted.” This comes as Gilani recently in a meeting in Islamabad claimed that India is using Afghan soil against Pakistan and Kabul government provides them the context of interference. “India is using Afghan soil against Pakistan. There is no doubt about this. They are doing this,” he claimed. Gilani said that he lived in Pakistan for 26 years and two of his daughters live Peshawar. He said Pakistan was like his second home.
