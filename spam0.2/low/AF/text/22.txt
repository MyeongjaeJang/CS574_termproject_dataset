Briefing a public gathering at his native province, Nangarhar, the lawmaker expressed deep concerns over the progress of the militant group across the province. “Daesh is making progress in eastern provinces of Afghanistan, but government not taking “efficient” measures to suppress the militant group,” he added. Qadir said the terrorists operating in some eastern districts of the province are foreigners, comprising Mangal Bagh-led Lashkar-e-Islam and Daesh. According to a general perception on the other side of Durand Line, Lashkar-e-Islam had generally believed as one among the group of good Taliban, which paved a way to Pakistan’s Army access to the Tirah valley. On the other side, Zahir Qadir announced his strong support to the government’s recent comprehensive and precondition offer to Taliban and called on the militant group to enter into the Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process. He said the militant should change the precondition offer into an opportunity to establish peace and progress for all. “Those who oppose peace, they deserve to be killed,” he said.
