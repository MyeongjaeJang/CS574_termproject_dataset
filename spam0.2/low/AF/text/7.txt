During the graduation ceremony of 828 Special Forces, the deputy of intelligence department of MoD, Abdul Khaliq Faryad stressed on serious preparations for the next fighting season. “We call the enemies that our peace plan is clear. The Afghan commandos will press and persuade the enemies to join the peace process in the battlefields,” Faryad said. In the meantime, the commander in chief of the Special Operation Military Corps, Besmillah Waziri warned the armed opposition groups that the Afghan forces will never allow them to target “innocent” people. “We will not allow the enemies to target our people and break the comforting environment of Afghanistan. Now Jihad (fight) is our right,” Waziri added. MoD officials noted that the armed oppositions are attempting to intensify the war in the next season but they will try to provide peace and stability in the country. This comes as President Ghani has left open the possibility for talks with militants who accept peace but said the door was closed to those who cause tragedies like recent attacks in the country.
