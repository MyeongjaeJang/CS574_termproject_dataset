But a spokesman for the Ministry of Interior (MoI) rejected the allegations of Afghan forces using schools as their strongholds. “There has been no incident where the Afghan forces have used schools as military bases. Unfortunately, the Taliban militants are still using schools and madrassas as their strongholds,” MoI Spokesman Najib Danish said. Fatima Nazari, a member of the lower house of parliament urges the government to pay more attention to the closed schools since “it is depriving children of education which is their legitimate right”. This comes as during the last one month, at least two schools were burned in Logar and Nangarhar provinces of the country by the anti-government insurgent groups.
