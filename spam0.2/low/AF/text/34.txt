They are doing that,” Gilani said at a gathering in Pakistan. Considering Pakistan as his second homeland, Gilani said: “I have lived in Pakistan for 26 years. My daughter is in Peshawar and she was born there. My eldest daughter has studied in Peshawar; alike millions of Afghans, she was also born there. My sons and daughters call Pakistan as their second home.” “I am a soldier of Jihad who stands in front of you,” he told the gathering. In reaction, the Afghan Defense Ministry called Gilani’s claim as “baseless”, insisting the government has not allowed any group or country to use Afghanistan against another nation. “We are not allowing any group or country to target neighboring countries from our soil,” the ministry Deputy Spokesman Mohammad Radmanish said. Meanwhile, A national intelligence source told Ariana News that Ishaq Gilani will be referred to judiciary institutions, following his sensitive remarks. This comes as India has been involved in a number of development projects in Afghanistan. India has financed and built Afghan Parliament, Kabul’s most prestigious high school, the transmission lines that light up Kabul and the buses that ferry commuters in the capital. India funded and helped rebuild the hydroelectric Salma Dam in western Herat province. India also built a 133-mile highway linking Afghanistan to Iran. Hundreds of Afghan diplomats, administrators and soldiers are sent to India for professional training. However, unlike India, Pakistan has long been accused by Afghan and U.S. governments of its involvement in terrorist activities in the region and beyond.
