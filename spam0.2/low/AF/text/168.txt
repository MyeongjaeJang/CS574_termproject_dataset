admin April 2, 2018 In Latest Updates , Nation Array AT-KABUL: The enemies of education have sprayed poison into a school in Lashkargah, the capital of southern Helmand province, sickening about 43 schoolgirls in what authorities suspect is a case of group poisoning. Public Health Director Dr. Aminullah Abid told Pajhwok Afghan News the poisoned girls were evacuated to Bost Hospital before noon on Monday. He said the students were in stable condition but the reason behind their poisoning could not be ascertained yet. The girls felt weak, according to the official. Education Director Dawood Shah Safari told Pajhwok the girls were students of 10thand 11th grades at Zarghoona Ana High School. “The NDS personnel are investigating into the incident.” He said according to the initial information, the girls passed out due to the torching of expired drugs in the vicinity. Deputy police chief Gul Khan said police and professional experts had been dispatched to the area to look into the incident. There is no immediate claim of responsibility, but in the past the Taliban terrorist always thumped their chest for such inhuman act against innocent schoolgirls. The Taliban extremist group has a history of targeting schoolgirls—and unfortunately, most part of the Helmand province is under the control of the Taliban insurgents who oppose the education of girls.
