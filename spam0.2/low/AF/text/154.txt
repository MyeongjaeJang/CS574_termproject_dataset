AT Monitoring Desk-KABUL: Commander of the United States Marine Corps General Robert B. Neller said the US forces will remain in Afghanistan to prevent attacks from Afghanistan on the US, such as the September 11 attacks. 
Speaking at the Atlantic Council, Neller said the US forces do not have a big role in Afghanistan’s war, but they remain in the country to provide advice and training to the Afghan forces. 
“We want to remain in Afghanistan because it was a safe haven for those that attacked our country in 9/11 and I think you can make the case if we were not there present and support the Afghan government, that could happen again,” said Neller. 
The US general said Afghanistan cannot remain in war for eternity. He insisted that other players in the region should play their roles in brining Taliban to negotiations table. 
“There is got to be reconciliation, a political resolution. We are going to have to get other players involved with this, other regional players thathave acuity there. There got to be a better way. You cannot live constant state of war,” Neller added. 
Meanwhile, officials from the Pentagon said new US forces have arrived in Afghanistan and that they have stationed in 36 battalions. 
According to the US Department of Defense, the total number of the new forces reaches to 1,000 who have rich advisory experience in Afghanistan and Iraq and volunteered to serve in Afghanistan and provide advice to Afghan forces in war against the Taliban. 
Neller made remarks on regional countries role in Afghanistan’s peace at a time that Uzbekistan last week hosted a meeting on Afghanistan’s peace in which it announced its readiness to host direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban.
