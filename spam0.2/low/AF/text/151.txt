AT News Report-KABUL: The parliament dismissed Pakistan’s allegations over the presence of Pakistani Taliban in Afghanistan, calling it “baseless”. 
Pakistan’s foreign ministry claimed that the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is based in Afghanistan and organized attack on a military center in Swat in Afghan soil. 
Sayed Ali Kazemi, a member of parliament said that Pakistan makes the allegations prior to the visit of Pakistani prime minister to Kabul that is slated to take place next week. 
“They (Pakistan officials) make the claim so their prime minister has something to say in his Kabul visit,” Kazemi said Saturday. 
“Pakistanis are trying to create something to discuss with Afghan officials in Abbasi’s visit. I want the government to deny the claims by credible evidences.” 
Pakistan said it had handed over evidences to the Afghan embassy in Islamabad indicating the presence of the country’s Taliban in Afghanistan. 
Although the Afghan foreign ministry said it was premature to comment on the allegations, but Zardosht Shams, deputy Afghan ambassador to Islamabad said the embassy had received notes from Pakistan and sent them to Kabul. 
Political analysts say that Pakistan tries to decrease international pressures by such allegations. 
“Pakistan is under huge pressures from international community and the world knows that Islamabad is supporting terrorism and using it as a tool. Pakistan cannot get out of the current isolation unless it really fights terrorism,” Khoshhal Khalil, a political expert said. 
Pakistan has repeatedly accused Afghanistan of harboring Pakistani Taliban that are organizing attacks in the Pakistani soil, an allegation rejected by the government of Afghanistan.
