  Presidential office in reaction to the Afghan-Pakistani forces’ clash along the cross-line, said that neither Pakistan nor Afghanistan benefit from the “tensions”, calling on Islamabad to fulfill the Afghan-Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity to prevent the cross-line problems. 
Pakistan cross-line troops were reported to have attacked Afghan cross-line posts in the Jaji   and Jaji district of Paktia provinces early Sunday. The clashes left two Afghan civilians and six militia men from Pakistan killed, according to the defense ministry and local people. 
“The plan has been signed and we ask Pakistani officials to put it in action, because tensions along the cross-line are in the benefit of nobody,” said Shah Hussain Mortazawi, President Ghani’s spokesman. 
He added many problems would be solved by fulfilling the action plan. 
Pakistani forces have recently disobeyed all agreements with Afghanistan, according to Mohammad Radmanesh, spokesman for the defense ministry. He added that Afghan security forces and local people “bravely” stood against the Pakistani attacks. 
Officials in Khost province said that the bodies of three Pakistani militia men were on the battle ground, while another Pakistani militia was arrested. 
Azizullah Din Mohammad, deputy chief of the High Peace Council, said that the cross-line clashes would negatively affect bilateral relationships and the government-initiated peace program. 
“Surely, this condition puts negative impact on the two countries’ relations, peace process and everything. Pakistan is better to abandon such moves because these things motivate our people and create more problems in the future.” 
He added that Pakistan wanted to formalize the Durand Line by these moves and planned to own some strategic points inside Afghanistan. “But these moves will be followed by severe reactions from Afghans that will further deteriorate relations, so Pakistan should give up.”
