Qadir made the remarks on Sunday at a gathering of dozens of Nangarhar residents who expressed concerns over the increase of insecurity and corruption in the province. The provincial governor’s Spokesman Ataullah Khogyani, however, said that the government is making serious efforts in the fight against Daesh and corruption. “We have had lots of success against both. The security issues resolved in the areas that had been under high-security threats,” he said. Supporting the government’s recent move in the peace process, Qadir also urged the Taliban to make use of the opportunity being provided to the insurgent group. “Talks should be made with those Taliban [fighters] who want to make peace, and those who are opposed, they deserve to be killed,” he said.
