Writer: Azizullah Popal Trump Slams Syrian President Bashar al-Assad over Alleged Chemical Attack 
US President Donald Trump said overnight there will be a "big price to pay" after what he called a "mindless" attack in Syria, allegedly involving chlorine gas. 
Trump also called Syrian President Bashar al-Assad an "animal." 
"President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. Big price to pay," Trump said in a pair of tweets which began with a discussion of the attack in Syria's Eastern Ghouta, where rescue workers alleged that regime loyalists had used chlorine gas. 
"Many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world," Trump tweeted. 
At least 80 civilians have been killed since Friday after the regime launched fresh air raids on rebel-held areas of Eastern Ghouta, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor.
