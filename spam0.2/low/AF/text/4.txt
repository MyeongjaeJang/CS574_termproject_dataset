The security, development and governance of Afghanistan remains crucial to reducing the terrorist threat to the UK, Mr. Williamson reaffirmed in his first visit to Afghanistan. “A secure Afghanistan will help keep the streets of Britain safe. Building the security services that will be the foundation of stability and peace in Afghanistan remains top of our agenda and I have seen first-hand the crucial role our brave Armed Forces are playing in realizing that vision”, the top British military official was cited as saying. It’s said that he has also met with UK personnel who are currently helping Afghan military leaders with train and advice support at Afghan National Army Officers Academy (ANAOA) in Qargha, on the western outskirts of Kabul. More than 3,000 officers have passed out of the academy since 2013, and, this year, ANAOA has nearly as many female cadets in training as have graduated in total since the academy opened. Mr Williamson has also met UK troops who lead the Kabul Security Force (KSF), which provides force protection for NATO staff in Kabul.
