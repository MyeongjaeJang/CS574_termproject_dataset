By Farhad Naibkhel-KABUL: Taliban in a predawn attack on Saturday destroyed the main power transmission line to Kabul, once again leaving the capital city in the dark, officials said. 
Police chief in Baghlan said the militants blew up another power pylon supplying electricity from Uzbekistan to Kabul in Tagakdistrict of Baghlan province. He said the Taliban had lost momentum in the battleground and changed their tactic to vandalizing public utilities. 
Security forces were clashing with insurgents to repel any security threats so that technician dispatches could restore the power line, said Ekarmudin Saray. 
This is the second time the militants blow up power supply pylons as they destroyed a power line in Gilagai area in Baghlan province nearly a month ago.Taliban took responsibility for the attack. In a statement, Talibanâ€™s spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said they had warned to cut off power supply to Kabul. 
Spokesman to the power utility, Wahidullah Tawhidi, corroborated reports and said that a team of engineers had been dispatched to the area, awaiting clearance from security forces to start restoration operation. DA Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat spokesperson said the pylon transmitted 20kvpower from Uzbekistan. Since it was blown up, 300 MWelectricity line has been cut, depriving 80 percent of Kabul city of electricity, he reckoned.
