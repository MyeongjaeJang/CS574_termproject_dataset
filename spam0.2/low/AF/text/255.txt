According to MP Sadat, these schools have been closed in Qush Tepa and Darzab districts of the province. Mohammad Radmanish, deputy spokesman for the Afghan ministry of defense confirms military use of schools by the Taliban and Daesh insurgent groups in the areas under their control. “Our military units are conducting operations in all those areas where Taliban controls the schools,” Radmanish said. “Once we cleared those areas we are handing over the schools to the ministry of education.” Reports suggest that nearly one thousand schools are closed across the country due to insecurity, but the ministry of education denies to make a comment about the statistics. Based on the figures, Kunduz, Takhar, Baghlan, Jawzjan, and Faryab are among the provinces where a large number of schools are closed and thousands of students are deprived of education.
