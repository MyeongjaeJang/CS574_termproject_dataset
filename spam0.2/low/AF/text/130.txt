AT News Report-KABUL: Afghanistan’s interior ministry has declared that police forces will discontinue any field missions for the Afghan police in the battlegrounds and rather guard and protect civilian within the main cities. 
A spokesperson to the interior ministry has said a lot of police forces are engaged in fighting against militants in the battlefields. Najib Danish declared that police forces will no longer serve in the combat zone and focus on metropolitan civilian protection. 
In the meantime, the Ministry of Defense (MoD) is said to believe that the absence of police forces in the battlegrounds would not have a negative impact. 
“We have our public protection forces and border police who positively serve on the battlefields and the absence of police forces is not a serious concern,” said Muhammad Radmanish, head of MoD press office. 
To drastically reduce police casualties and transform ANP into a more effective force tasked with routine policing services rather than combat operations, the MoI has laid out a strategic plan for 2018-2021. 
According to MoI, the purpose of the Afghan National Police Strategy (ANPS) is to provide strategic guidance for the continued development and operational capability of the Ministry of Interior (MoI) to meet the current and future challenges of stabilization and security of the nation.
