According to the statement, Ismail Khan had demanded the militant group that if the Taliban are not willing to respond the government’s peace offer, then they should start talks with Jihadi leaders for ending violence and the war in Afghanistan. The statement said that the Taliban appreciates any true and real efforts for ending the ongoing conflicts in the country. “Islamic Emirate invites all individuals, Jihadi leaders or anyone else, who are trying to end the current invasion and does not support foreign invasion, to its political office for finding a political settlement”, the statement reads. It further noted that they should share their opinions about how to end the “foreign invasion of Afghanistan”, establishing an Islamic political system, and reaching a peace settlement through the Doha Office. The National Unity Government of Afghanistan (NUG) has yet to comment regarding the statement and offer of Ismail Khan for starting direct peace talks with the Taliban.
