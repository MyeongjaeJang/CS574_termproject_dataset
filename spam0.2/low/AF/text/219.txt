No: 6145 About 50 lawmakers are still absent in Wolesi Jirga for years 
“Twenty two Wolesi Jirgamembers of getting all privileges besides being permanently absent from the house.” Lawmaker Ghulam Hussain Nasari on Saturday said. 
Nasari also accused that 33 other lawmakers did not appear in the house from the past seven years. Pajhwak said. 
He said these lawmakers received salaries, all right and privileges but never represented the masses. 
“I will give the statistics and you conduct investigations, thank you for your patience for some lawmakers. Neither the Wolesi Jirga nor did the lower house secretariat was able to deal with absent representatives and this is the clear violation of article 22 of the constitution,” he said. 
Article 22 says any kind of discrimination and distinction between citizens of Afghanistan shall be forbidden. The citizens of Afghanistan, man and woman, have equal rights and duties before the law. 
He asked the administrative penal to investigate both cases and promised to provide evidence if needed. 
He added the lower house should share the results with the people so that they would be careful in upcoming elections. Related news:
