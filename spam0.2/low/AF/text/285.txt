AT News Report-KABUL: Yet another sit-in camp was set up in northern Balkh province, demanding militants to renounce violence and embrace peace. Residents and civil society activists also demanded the UN mission to backlist Pakistan as a terror sponsoring state. 
The activists said their movement was aimed at supporting peace and the protest in Helmand. This comes weeks after a number of Helmand residents established a sit-in camp in Lashkargah city in support of peace. Due to its benign nature, the move reverberated exponentially across the country. 
The Balkh campaigners believed that peace was a nationwide demand and collective endeavor, and those defying it were enemies of the country. They called on the United Nations to pressure Pakistan and seek ways to end the war and bring out a lasting peace. 
This peace camp is a testimony that all Afghans from all across the country should echo their voice for peace and stability and that Afghanistan is home to every Afghan living in any corner of the country, said a civil society activist. 
Another campaigner said it was time to come to terms with the fact that war was not in the interest of Afghanistan and those fueling the fans of war were puppets of dissident countries.
