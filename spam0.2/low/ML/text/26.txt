“YouTube, which is owned by Google, operates out of San Bruno, a suburb of San Francisco that is about 10 miles from the city. The company has several hundred employees but it is unclear how many of them are based out of the headquarters as YouTube also has large operations in Los Angeles and New York,” according to The Hollywood Reporter . 
YouTube product manager Todd Sherman posted the following on Twitter . 
“We were sitting in a meeting and then we heard people running because it was rumbling the floor. First thought was earthquake. After [exiting] the room we still didn’t know what was going on but more people were running. Seemed serious and not like a drill. We headed towards the exit and then saw more people and someone said that there was a person with a gun. Shit. At that point every new person I saw was a potential shooter. Someone else said that the person shot out the back doors and then shot themselves. I looked down and saw blood drips on the floor and stairs. Peaked around for threats and then we headed downstairs and out the front.” 
According to ABC 7 , police have confirmed that the suspect “is a white, adult female wearing a dark top and head scarf.” 
According to TMZ , the San Bruno police said that there was a woman down “with a gunshot wound to her chest.” Police also said that a handgun was found near the woman’s body. Share this:
