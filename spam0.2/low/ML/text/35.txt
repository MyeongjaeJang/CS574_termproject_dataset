By Comment 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold of Texas has resigned abruptly from Congress, saying it is time for him to “move along and look for new ways to serve.”

A former aide has said Farenthold subjected her to sexually suggestive comments and behavior and then fired her after she complained. 
The allegations against Farenthold first surfaced in 2014, when he was sued by his former communications director, Lauren Greene. 
The independent Office of Congressional Ethics recommended that the House Ethics Committee dismiss the case, but the allegations were revived after it became public that Farenthold paid an $84,000 settlement using money from a taxpayer-funded account.
