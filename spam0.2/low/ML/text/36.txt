Pep Guardiola has gone full Pep Guardiola with his line-up against Man United today 
By Comment TITLE? 
Seven midfielders and not a striker in sight for the most important Premier League match of the season? Oh, Pep! Well, look at this. 
In what is probably Man City’s biggest game of the season, Pep Guardiola seemingly has one eye on the second-leg of their Champions League clash with Liverpool on Tuesday – and has rested Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker for today’s game against United. 
City lost 3-0 to Liverpool during the week, but many of us still fancy City to get something against Reds at the Etihad next week. 
Who knows?

But in the meantime, there’s the small matter of securing the Premier League title against their bitter foes today. 
And the Catalan gaffer is going into this one without a recognised striker on the pitch. 
That’s right, Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus start on the bench today. How we line-up in the 176th Manchester Derby! 🙌 
City XI | Ederson, Danilo, Kompany (C), Otamendi, Delph, Fernandinho, Gundogan, Bernardo, Silva, Sane, Sterling 
Subs | Bravo, Walker, Agüero, Laporte, De Bruyne, Jesus, Yaya Touré

In attack, he’s gone for Leroy Sane, Raheem Sterling and Bernardo Silva, while David Silva and Ilkay Gundogan will be pulling the strings in midfield. Fabian Delph is probably playing as a wing-back. 
That means there’s seven midfielders in his starting-XI. Very Guardiola-esque, wouldn’t you say?

Saying that, it’s hardly a weakened side, with eight of City’s strongest XI starting. And remember, this line-up cost a pretty penny, too. Man City’s “weakened” team to face Man United cost £304million.

For United, well, we can tell you that Paul Pogba is starting… for the team in red. 
With rumours coming this week that he was offered to Guardiola in January and judging by his hair colour at the moment, you coulda fooled us.
