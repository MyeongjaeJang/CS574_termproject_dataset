But he’ll never score another one quite like this. 
Yep, that happened. 
On the 64th minute, Juve oldies Giorgio Chiellini and Gianluigi Buffon got into a bit of a tangle and eventually allowed Dani Carvajal to cross the ball into the centre, towards an expectant Ronaldo. 
And with his back to goal, he sent an overhead kick into the top right corner, completely rooting Buffon to the spot and stunning the entire stadium. 
In fact, even the Juve fans were on their feet applauding the goal. 
Take a look. 
Juventus fans stand and applaud a moment they’ll never forget 👏 
Take a bow, Cristiano! pic.twitter.com/KJaqtknGoO

Ronaldo was visibly moved by the reception, seemingly gesturing to the home fans as if to say thanks for the recognition. 
They’ve seen a lot of fine football at this stadium since it opened in 2011 and they certainly know class when they see it. 
It looks like Real will be on their way to the semi-final, having beaten their Italian opponents 3-0 in their own backyard – with Marcelo getting among the goals moments after Ronaldo’s strike. 
They’re gonna win the thing again, aren’t they?
