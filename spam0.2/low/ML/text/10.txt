Measuring our visitors We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics.

All of that information is anonymous – so we don’t know who you are; just that somebody visited our site.

To function their buttons generally know if you’re logged in; for example Facebook use this to say “x of your friends like this”. We do not have any access to that information, nor can we control how those networks use it. Social networks therefore could know that you’re viewing this website, if you use their services (that isn’t to say they do, but their policies may change).
