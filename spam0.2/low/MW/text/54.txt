Home National Peter Mutharika’s committee has failed us— Apam KONDOWE—There is no political will Peter Mutharika’s committee has failed us— Apam Posted By: Times Correspondent on: March 27, 2018 In: National No Comments 
Association of Persons with Albinism in Malawi (Apam) has asked President Peter Mutharika to review activities of the National Technical Committee on Abuse of Persons with Albinism in Malawi, arguing the committee has failed to deliver. 
Apam has faulted the committee for failing to demonstrate lack of political will to deal with attacks and killings of persons with albinism (PWAs); hence, there is need for the appointing authority to review its membership. 
A statement Apam issued as it condoled the family of the 22-year-old missing young man with albinism – in Machinga District– MacDonald Masambuka. 
Masambuka was reportedly abducted on the night of March 9 2018 near Chikwewo Trading Centre. 
Apam Vice Secretary for Machinga, Elliot Chamveka, said the Presidential Committee has failed to deliver any tangible results since it was instituted. 
Apam President, Overstone Kondowe, said the committee, which is being led by Hetherwick Ntaba, has failed to deliver to the expectations of PWAs and that its existence is merely ceremonial. 
“The association has never heard anything from Ntaba, who was appointed to steer the fight against attacks and killings of PWAs. Kenya and Tanzania managed to end this vice because there was political will,” he said. 
Kondowe said his association has lost confidence in the police as well as the Presidential Committee. 
“The abduction and missing of Masambuka have prompted us to lose trust and confidence in the two institutions,” he said. 
When contacted, Ntaba said he was yet to get a copy of the statement. He, however, defended the committee, saying it had done its best to end cases of attacks on PWAs. 
Ntaba added that the committee would soon meet the Apam leadership to brief it on latest developments.
