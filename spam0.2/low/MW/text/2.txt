Livingstonia Synod of the Church of Central Africa Presbyterian (CCAP) Monday hit back at Minister of Transport and Public Works, Jappie Mhango, saying he lacks political maturity 
The synod was reacting to Mhango’s calls Monday that the leadership at CCAP Livingstonia should resign and join politics. 
“We cannot resign because we were not called by DPP [Democratic Progressive Party] but by God to serve people and we are not serving DPP,”General Secretary, Reverend Levi Nyondo, said Monday. 
He described Mhango as a politician who lacks maturity. 
“We repeat DPP has scored four out of 10 both in implementation of development [projects] and good governance. This is a true reflection and our words are final,” Nyondo added. 
Mhango, who is also DPP National Campaign Director, said the synod is ungrateful despite the current administration’s development efforts in the region. 
“Tell him the church will always be there but politicians come and go,” Nyondo said. 
Yesterday, when The Daily Times contacted Mhango again for his comment, he refused to respond to Nyondo’s outbursts. 
Moderator for the synod, Reverend John Gondwe, also joined the fray, saying that Mhango should be reminded that the synod’s responsibility is to criticise where the government goes astray and commend where it has done well. 
Livingstonia Synod has never been in good terms with DPP since 2014 when the then president, the late Bingu wa Mutharika, clashed with the Northern Region church over the quota system.
