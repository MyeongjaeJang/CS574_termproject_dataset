Gender Governance and Justice Development Centre (GGJDC), a non-governmental organization that promotes social justice, Monday donated 61 bicycles to community facilitators in Lilongwe. 
GGJDC Board Chairperson, Peter Chisi, said the donation would help ease transportation challenges that community facilitators are facing in their day-to-day work. 
“The facilitators face many challenges when they want to move from one community to another to raise awareness on a number of issues,” Chisi said. 
He said the bicycles would also help in implementing GGJDC’s programme of women empowerment for elected positions. 
Chisi said the organisation would ensure that women are interested in taking part in the 2019 tripartite elections. 
Speaking on behalf of the community facilitators, Elina Makondesa, from Chiwamba Ward, said the donation would help them move from one community to another without difficulties. 
Gender Governance Justice and Development Centre is supported by Dutch Foreign Affairs Ministry through Hivos.
