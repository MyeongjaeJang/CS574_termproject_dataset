Information from the office of the former president Joyce Banda indicates that her homecoming remains a mystery. 
In recent weeks, reports have been rife that the country’s ex-leader would be in the country this month. 
But in an interview, Banda’s spokesperson Andekuche Chanthunya distanced himself from the reports, saying Malawians will be properly informed at an opportune time. 
“I am not answering you whether it is this month or not. But when she is coming, we will issue a statement and you will get information on her home coming,” Chanthunya said. 
He said he has never told anyone that Banda is coming back in April 2018, calling such reports as mere fabrications. 
Banda left Malawi in 2014, few months after losing the presidency to President Peter Mutharika in what some people describe as a self-imposed exile. 
In July last year, the Malawi Police Service announced that it had obtained a warrant of arrest for the former president due her alleged involvement in Cashgate of 2013. 
Her attempts for a judicial review of the warrant of arrest saw the High Court dismissing the application. 
In an interview on Thursday, Deputy National Police spokesperson Thomeck Nyaude said the warrant of arrest is in force within Malawi and they are still in touch with Interpol on the red notice.
