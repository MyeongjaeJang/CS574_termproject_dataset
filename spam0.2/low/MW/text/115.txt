Football Association of Malawi (Fam) has warned striker Khuda Muyaba that he risks a ban and fine over his controversial switch from Moyale Barracks FC to Silver Strikers. 
Fam Transfer Matching System Manager, Casper Jangale, on Thursday said their records show that Muyaba belongs to Moyale. 
“We are just hearing from the media that he is with Silver. We are yet to be briefed on his matter, and let me put this on record that he is not eligible to feature in the Fam Charity Shield this weekend,” Jangale said. 
Jangale also warned Silver that they risk a fine if they do not follow proper procedures before using the player. 
“They need to get a clearance from Moyale if, indeed, the player was released, otherwise there are consequences,” he said. 
Earlier, Silver General Secretary (GS), Thabo Chakaka- Nyirenda, told the media that Muyaba signed a three-year contract with the Reserve Bank of Malawi-sponsored team. 
Chakaka-Nyirenda admitted that the player had issues to sort out with Moyale. 
However, Moyale General Secretary, Isaac Banda, expressed ignorance on Muyaba’s switch to Silver. 
“Unless they have permission from higher Malawi Defence Force authorities, that contract is not valid. We don’t know anything about Muyaba joining Silver. We are also hearing this from the media,” Banda said. 
Muyaba, who is a soldier, came into the limelight when he single-handedly knocked out Nyasa Big Bullets from the Fisd Challenge Cup semi-finals after scoring two goals last season. 
Muyaba, who is capped once, trained with Silver on Wednesday ahead of the Charity Shield. He recently hit at Moyale officials for frustrating his potential transfer to foreign teams amid interest from Mozambique and Botswana.
