Lilongwe City Council (LCC) has said it is facing challenges in refuse collection. 
LCC Chief Executive Officer, Moza Zeleza, said this over the weekend. 
Residents of the capital have been accusing LCC of laxity in waste management, with some business and residential areas hosting piles of garbage for many days on end. 
“Yes, it may seem that there is laxity in the execution of our responsibilities as regards refuse collection… but we are addressing this challenge,” Zeleza said. 
Since December 2017, LCC has been implementing the Keep Lilongwe Clean and Green Campaign in which the council’s senior officials, including Mayor Desmond Bikoko, are moving out of their offices every two weeks to involve residents in cleaning exercises.
