Home Sports Fam mum on World Cup tickets GUNDA— The demand goes with the liking of the people Fam mum on World Cup tickets Posted By: Isaac Salima on: March 31, 2018 
Football Association of Malawi (Fam) has kept close to its chest information regarding sales of entry tickets to the 2018 World Cup finals in Russia. 
Fifa allocates tickets to each member association for sale. 
But asked how many tickets were allocated to Malawi, and how many have been sold so far, Fam General Secretary, Alfred Gunda, last week simply said everything was going on well. 
“We have our allocation and for those interested in going to Russia, we are available to facilitate the purchase as a member association,” Gunda said. 
He was also not specific on demand for the tickets so far. 
“The demand goes with the liking of the people. Some countries are tourist destinations. You cannot compare the hype that was there for Brazil with Russia. People will have different interests for going to these two countries. So, this drives the whole market of football,” Gunda said. 
The Russia World Cup will run from June 14 to July 15. 
According to Fifa, ticket sales were divided into two periods. 
During the random selection draw from December 5, 2017, to January 31, 2018, fans applied for individual match tickets for all matches except the opening match and the final, venue-specific tickets and supporter tickets. 
Over 700,000 tickets have since been sold already. 
During the first-come, first-served period, that will last from March 13 to April 3, 2018, “fans will be able to purchase tickets in real time on Fifa.com. Tickets with immediate confirmation of successful application will be subject to availability. 
Fifa pointed out that “a total of 742,760 tickets were allocated during the two periods of sales phase one.” 
Fans will also “have a final chance to secure tickets during the last-minute sales phase, which will be implemented on a first-come, first-served basis from April 18 to July 15 2018, the day of the 2018 World Cup final.” 
There are four categories of tickets. Category three tickets prices range from K77,000 ($105) to K209,000 ($285). Category two tickets vary from K121,000 ($165) to K352,000 ($480) while category one ticket prices range from K153,000 ($210) to K549,000 ($750). 
The discounted category four tickets are reserved for Russian citizens. The cheapest category four ticket is worth K16,000 ($21.5).
