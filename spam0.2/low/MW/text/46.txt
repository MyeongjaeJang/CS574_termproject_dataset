The roads Authority has spent about K600 million compensating people affected by the 95-kilometre Lilongwe Old Airport-Kasiya- Santhe Road project, Chief Executive Officer, Emmanuel Matapa, said over the weekend 
Matapa said the project has been delayed because of the issue of compensating all the people living along the stretch that took time 
“The challenge of compensating people is what has delayed the whole project, but now that we have completed compensating the people, the contractor is now free to start work and finish the remaining 37 km ,” Matapa said. 
Minister of Transport and Public works Jappie Mhango on Friday travelled along the road to check progress made so far. 
During the visit, Matapa said although they faced challenges in the initial stages of the project, they are happy that the project is now progressing well. 
Mhango said the new road will help people of the area enormously as the area is rich in agriculture and is one of the areas that contributes significantly to the economic growth. 
Mhango said people in the area grow tobacco, maize and groundnuts which are some of the most important crops grown in the country. 
“The road will ease transport problems on the people of this area, and they will be able to easily connect with other areas of importance. 
He says the project is expected to be completed in December this year.
