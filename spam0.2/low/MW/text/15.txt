C onsumer prices increased 7.8 percent year-on-year in February 2018, slowing from a 8.1 percent gain the previous month, thanks to the continued improvement in food availability, the National Statistical Office (NSO) has said. 
Inflation picked up in January 2018 from 7.1 percent in December 2017 in the wake of a rebasing process NSO conducted to ensure that its calculation of inflation be more reflective of the situation on the ground. 
According to NSO, food inflation continued to soften in the month under review standing at 7.3 percent down from 7.6 percent in January. 
In February, non-food inflation stood at 9.4 percent, down from 9.6 percent. 
Food inflation for the month is at 2.4 percent compared to 8.4 percent recorded in January, 2018 while non-food-inflation is 1.9 percent compared to 1.4 percent in January, 2018. 
The urban month-on-month inflation rate records 1.1 percent. Urban food and non-food inflation rates stand at 0.2 and 1.6 percent respectively. 
The rural month-on-month inflation rate registers 3.0 percent. Rural food and no-food inflation rates stand at 3.6 and 2.3 percent respectively
