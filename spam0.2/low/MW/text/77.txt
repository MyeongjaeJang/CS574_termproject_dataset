Azam Tigers FC are looking for a new coach after their target, Gerald Phiri Senior, snubbed an offer for a return to the team. 
Tigers Technical Director, Robin Alufandika, Thursday confirmed that they failed to convince Phiri to return to the club. 
Phiri told The Nation earlier this week that he was taking a breather from coaching this year. 
“We really wanted Phiri to help us after the exit of Patrick Kulemeka last season because he [Phiri] knows this team well. But we respect his decision. Otherwise our preparations are going on well with Chikaiko Bridge in charge of training. We are eyeing the 2018 Super League champion hip,” Alufandika said. 
He said they had earmarked Mulanje Park Stadium for home games in the 2018 season so as to increase their fan-base. 
In December, Tigers sold goalkeeper William Thole, defender Peter Cholopi and midfielder Dan Kumwenda to Be Forward Wanderers.
