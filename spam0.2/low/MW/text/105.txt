National Referees Association (NRA) has demanded improved perks for whistle-men before the start of the 2018 TNM Super League season on April 14. 
A set of Super League referees pockets K55,000 per game, with each (referee and two assistants) earning K15,000 per game and K10,000 for the fourth official. 
NRA General Secretary, Chris Kalichero, said they would write Super League of Malawi (Sulom) to consider increasing transport, meal and accommodation allowances for referees, saying prices of commodities have risen. 
“While we commend Sulom for doing a good job last season, we are in the process of engaging them so that we can plan for the new season. We have a number of issues which we want them [Sulom] to address, including increasing allowances for our referees,” Kalichero said. 
He added that the perks for the referees were ‘too little’ compared to other countries. 
In South Africa’s Absa Premier League, a referee earns K293,220 (R4,887) per game before tax, while their assistants pocket K228,540 (R3,809). 
The fees are applicable to league and cup competitions in South Africa, according to Sowetan newspaper edition of February 11 2016. The Daily Times used K60=R1. 
A referee earns K129, 060 ($180) per match to officiate a Zimbabwe Premier League match and K114,720 ($160) for an assistant. K717=1$. 
In Zambia, a referee pockets K18,240 (240 Zambia kwacha) for handling a top-flight league match. As of yesterday, a bank in Zambia put the exchange rate at K76=1 Zambia kwacha. 
Elsewhere, a referee pockets K48,000 (P800) in Botswana Premier League per game. United Kingdom media pegged K1.150,000 (£1,150) as the fee for a Premier League referee per game. 
Sulom Deputy General Secretary, Thokozani Chazema, admitted that the referees do not get enough allowances. 
“As much as we agree that they do not receive enough resources, we need to consider where we can get the money to support them,” Chazema said. 
Unlike in other countries, local referees do not have a separate sponsor for their perks.
