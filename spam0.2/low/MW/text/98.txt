Home National Rabies outbreak hits Mangochi SAFE WHEN VACCINATED—Dog Posted By: Yohane Symon on: April 06, 2018 In: National No Comments 
About 18 people in the lakeshore district of Mangochi are hanging on to dear life following a rabies outbreak in the district 
Village Headman Ng’omba said rabid dogs have bitten 18 people in his area, infecting them with rabies in the process. 
“In the month of March only, rabid dogs have bitten about 18 people in surrounding villages of Nkukuta, Ching’anda, Mtekete and Nalungu,” he said 
He said that most of the affected people are being treated in Salima District because it is reported that both Lulanga and Makanjira Community hospitals do not have the vaccine. 
Ng’omba appealed to authorities to make the vaccines available within the health facilities so as to help people who are being bitten by infected dogs. 
“Alternatively, we appeal to veterinary officials to kill or vaccinate the infected dogs to save more people from being affected,” Ng’omba said. 
Mangochi District Health Officer spokesperson, Harold Kabuluzi, confirmed the development in an interview. 
He also acknowledged that anti-rabies vaccines are scarce in Mangochi. 
“These drugs are not kept in health centers because they are protected drugs,” he said. 
Kabulizi, however, assured the people that the anti-rabies drugs are available at Mangochi District hospital; hence, the affected people should get the treatment at the district hospital and not any other health centre. 
Mangochi District Agriculture Development Officer, Owen Kumwenda, said his office is yet to receive an official report from the area’s Agriculture Extension Planning Officer in regards to the rabies outbreak. 
However, Kumwenda said his office would take up the matter and take appropriate action to make sure that people’s lives are not lost.
