Home Sports Ndacha Mcherenje finishes last IN LAST-PLACE FINISH—Mcherenje Posted By: Ronald Mpaso on: April 17, 2018 In: Sports No Comments 
Long-distance runner, Ndacha Mcherenje, on Sunday wound up Malawi’s fruitless sojourn at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast City, Australia, with a last-place finish in a full marathon. 
Athletics and netball represented the country at the Games but neither was good enough to end Malawi’s long wait for a medal from a big international competition. 
Mcherenje was the only Malawian in action on the final day of the event and completed the marathon in 2:45:31, which was 28 minutes 45 seconds behind winner Michael Shelley of Australia’s 2:16:46. 
The result summed up Malawi’s poor showing at the Games, which started with Golden and Dalitso flopping in the 400 metres’ heats where they finished on positions six and 13, respectively. 
Benedicto Makumba finished on position eight in 800 metres’ race whereas Gervazio Mpani and Chancy Master were ninth and 14th, respectively, in 5,000 metres contest. 
Kefas Kasten also finished ninth in the 10,000 metres’ category. 
In his analysis of the athletes’ performances, Athletics Association of Malawi General Secretary, Frank Chitembeya, said Mpani and Kasten were impressive despite failing to win anything for Team Malawi. 
“What athletics Malawi is lacking are financial resources to help groom athletes into world-class competitors. We need well-wishers to come forward and give us support,” he said.
