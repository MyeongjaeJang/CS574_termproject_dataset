Total Malawi and the Malawi University of Science and Technology (Must) on Friday signed a management training programme agreement, which will see Total providing internship and apprentice ship opportunities to Must students. 
Speaking on the sidelines of the signing ceremony, Total Malawi Managing Director, Aegidia Shnepp, said that Total is excited with the arrangement as it will provide exposure to the students of market dynamics. 
“The world of technology is continuously evolving and giving the students an opportunity for an on-the-job training is ideal. 
“In fact, we share some common values with the university and this agreement is going to open up opportunities,” she said. 
Must Deputy Vice Chancellor, Jonathan Makuwira, hailed the agreement, describing it as timely. 
“Universities today need an interface with the industry. Universities are no longer isolated from the world and this agreement to us, signals high level of commitment,” he said. 
He further said the university has developed a policy that would ensure all students undergo industrial training before they graduate.
