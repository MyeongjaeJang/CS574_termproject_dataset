The Malawi Bureau of Standards (MBS) has revealed plans to open nuclear laboratories in Lilongwe and Mzuzu to accelerate accreditation procedures. 
This is coming at a time the bureau is constructing a state-of-the art laboratory in Blantyre for similar functions. 
The revelation was made on Tuesday in Lilongwe when MSB awarded certificates to 95 companies from across the country that have demonstrated continuous compliance with relevant Malawi standards during the past year. 
MSB Chairperson, Action Amos, said, in recent years, there has been an overwhelming demand for certification from small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the private sector in general, which has prompted the move. 
He said MBS has identified a building to house the laboratory in Lilongwe and are working on installing equipment. 
“Though we are constructing a state-of-the-art laboratory in Blantyre, we understand that there are some companies operating in Lilongwe and Mzuzu and other parts of the country and we would like to reach out to those as well with our services,” Amos said. 
According to Amos, MSB has intensified efforts to have all products made in the country approved so that they are able to compete on the international markets in addition to protecting consumers from exploitation. 
“It is a big achievement to have awarded certificates to 96 businesses because it is a reflection of a quality orientation. 
“We, as an organisation, are moving away from the age where people did not know there right to quality to where they are demanding it,” Amos said.
