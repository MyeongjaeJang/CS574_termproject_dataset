A man was killed in Phalombe District on Sunday when a house belonging to Holy Family Hospital went up in flames, destroying property worth millions of kwacha, police said Monday. 
The house belongs to hospital matron Sabina Kamtera. 
Phalombe Police Station spokesperson, Innocent Moses, said the victim, identified as Helemesi Kamtera, failed to escape as he was in deep sleep when the fire broke out in the house. 
Moses said Kamtera, 42, was a brother to the hospital matron. 
Moses said the deceased failed to escape as the fire had already engulfed exit points when he woke up. 
“We received a report yesterday (Sunday) around 10 o’clock in the morning that the matron’s house had caught fire. People who were around tried to extinguish the fire but failed… it was the smoke that woke him up because he was down with a cough and was in deep sleep,” Moses said. 
“When he woke up, he panicked, fell down, collapsed and was burnt to ashes,’ he said. 
Kamtera was buried on the same day in Nkundi Village, Traditional Authority Mabuka, in Mulanje District. 
The cause of the fire is not yet known and police say they are yet to come up with the value of the property that has been destroyed by the fire.
