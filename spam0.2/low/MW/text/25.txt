Kulima Gold millionaire promotion came to a final draw with three lucky winners walking away with K1 million each. 
The three are Mussa Mabvuto, Yotam Chaula and a Mrs Ali. 
Rab Processors Sales and Distribution Manager, Douglas Mandala, said the promotion was a way of connecting with their customers. 
“As a company, we thought about the ways we could give back to our customers for their support of Kulima Gold Fertiliser. The promotion also posed as a platform for feedback for the company to know what can be improved to satisfy our consumers,” Mandala said. 
He also stated that for those that were not lucky to win the K1 million, benefitted from the competition by purchasing Kulima Gold Fertiliser which will ensure growth of crops upon use. 
Mandala also said as Rab Processors is heading towards 35 years of existence, Malawians should be on the lookout for promotions from subsidiary groups under the company this year.
