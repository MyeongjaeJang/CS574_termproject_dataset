Blantyre City Council (BCC) says it plans to construct modern latrines and start emptying filled-up toilets within the city to improve sanitation in the commercial city, a senior city council official said on Tuesday 
The council, through the ‘Sanitation Service Level Agreement’, has partnered a private company, Waste Advisers, with the aim of preventing communicable diseases such as cholera by ensuring good toilets. 
BCC Deputy Director of Health and Social Services, Samden Seunda, said during a press briefing on Tuesday they are targeting low-income areas where issues of poor sanitation are common. 
“The modern toilets will assist in improving levels of hygiene while ensuring that people have good toilets which, in the long run, will assist in preventing cholera and diarrhoea,” Seunda said. 
He said the awareness campaign the council has embarked on has so far reached out to almost 10,000 households with messages focused on the importance of emptying toilets other than constructing new ones and also on cholera prevention. 
“So far, we have constructed about 30 toilets in public markets, transit routes and rehabilitated the existing ones.” 
Technical Consultant for Waste Adviser, Marcel Chisi, said they are certain that the campaign will bear fruits since the initiative will be managed by the private sector. 
“The toilets that the city council is constructing will be sub-contracted to the private sector but will remain city council property. The idea is that the private sector will find business opportunities and will, therefore, maintain them in a clean and healthier way,” Chisi said.
