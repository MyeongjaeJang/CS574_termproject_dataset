Malawi Congress Party (MCP) president, Lazarus Chakwera, on Saturday called on the Malawi Electoral Commission (Mec) to act on the violence in Mulanje’s Milonde Ward, a day before a by-election is held. 
Chakwera condemned what happened in Mulanje, saying it is a retrogression “which has no place in the country’s modern democracy”. 
The MCP president was speaking in an interview after addressing a political rally at Malindi ground in Mangochi District, where he went to drum up support for the party’s candidate in Tuesday’s local government by election. 
“As a party we want to strongly condemn the Mulanje attack on our supporters… we want Mec to act on the incident because we believe those people had an intention of disrupting the election process,” Chakwera said. 
He said Malawians are not stupid to continue supporting individuals who are interested in political violence. 
Chakwera called on other political parties to learn to tolerate diverse views, which, he said, is one of the tenets of democracy which Malawians chose in 1993. 
“This is a litmus test for Mec. We registered our concern with them. If they are not able to handle a small by-election by failing to act on the violence in Milonde, how can they be trusted that they will be on top of their game in 2019,” Chakwera said. 
He asked people to stop supporting political parties who have nothing but violence to offer to Malawians, saying such politicians deserve to be ousted. 
Chakwera asked party members not to castigate any person but, rather, engage the masses in issue-based discussions which have the potential to generate genuine ideas that can help move the country forward
