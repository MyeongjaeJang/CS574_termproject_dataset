As one way of showing love and care to special needs people, students of Odsherreds Efterskole High School from Denmark donated several items to special needs students at Mzimba Secondary School. 
Led by their teacher Maria Gast, they donated clothes, lotion for persons with albinism, clutches, a suitcase and other materials. 
Speaking after the donation, one of the students Hanne Elabdi said they did not come to Malawi for a mere education visit but to also encourage needy students at Mzimba Secondary School. 
“Do not look down upon yourselves because of your disability and you must work hard in class because education is the key to success,” Elabdi told the local students. 
A representative of the special needs students, Lissa Kumwenda, thanked the Danish delegation for the support, saying most of the students come from poor families who cannot afford to give them all the necessary supplies such as skin lotion which is expensive and difficult to access at government hospital. 
Mzimba Seconndary School Head teacher, Zimulange Mhango,said the donation had come at the right time. 
“Ours is a boarding school and an inclusive learning centre where we have the visually impaired, persons with Albinism, the lame, those with hearing impairment and other special needs students who face a lot of challenges financially,” Mhango said. 
The school has 560 students, 46 of whom are special needs students. 
The Danish students also renovated Bandawe Secondary School in Nkhatabay by fixing windows and painting, before renovating Chanyoli Primary School in Rumphi. 
Odsherreds Efterskole High School students visit Malawi as part of their annual education visit each year through DanChurchAid.
