Malawi could have a violence-free campaign in the run up to the 2019 tripartite elections if faith leaders could assume an active role in preventing the vice, a senior police officer has said. 
Lilongwe Police Station Crime Prevention Officer, Hardwell Chimonjo, was speaking when he addressed an interfaith gathering, which was organised by the Lilongwe Interfaith Dialogue Association with assistance from a German organisation – Miserior – through the Centre for Social Concern (CfSC). 
He said faith leaders should seriously consider coming up with strategies that could help prevent cases of political violence in 2019. 
“We want them to come up with structures so that they can work with the police in preventing cases of crime during the campaign and election period. We wish they should use the respect they command in the society to promote a peaceful campaign and election,” Chimoyo said 
Chairperson for the interfaith group, Bishop Songolo Mposa, said his group is committed to raising awareness among believers to preserve peace and tranquillity during the campaign and election period. Malawi goes to the polls in 15 months’ time
