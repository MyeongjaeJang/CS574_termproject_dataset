The Nsanje Magistrate’s Court has convicted and sentenced two people to three years imprisonment for abusing money that was meant for a Local Development Fund (LDF) project. 
A statement released by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) showed that the two, Useni Pensulo (Village Headman Alufandika) and Rashid Mamani, chairperson of a Village Development Committee, were arrested on January 26, 2017. 
The bureau’s Senior Public Relations Officer, EgritaNdala, who has signed the statement, disclosed that Pensulo and Mamani connived to include ghost workers on the list of villagers to work on a project to construct a canal from Shire River to Tikondane Irrigation scheme. 
She said the two were later taken to court where they were charged with uttering a false document, theft and misuse of office. 
“On 20th March 2018, Nsanje Magistrate’s Court convicted the two on all three counts. They were sentenced to 36 months imprisonment for misuse of public office, 18 months for uttering a false document, and twelve months for theft. The sentences are expected to run concurrently,” reads Ndala’s statement. 
The Bureau has in recent years been arresting people suspected to have been involved in abuse of funds under the LDF. 
In January this year, the graft-busting institution also arrested Mzimba Hora MP, Christopher Mzomera Ngwira over allegations that he abused the funds.
