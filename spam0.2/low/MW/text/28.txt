Construction of Beach Soccer Stadium has started with phase one in Lilongwe, raising hopes of the country having the first-ever facility. 
The government, through the Office of the President and Cabinet (OPC), provided a piece of land for the facility close to Civo Stadium in Lilongwe, following a request from Central Region Beach Soccer Association. 
The first phase, which involves transferring sand to the playing surface, is expected to be completed next month. 
The association’s Chairperson, Allie Mwachande, said he was excited with the prospect of having the stadium, whose second phase would involve construction of terraces and dressing rooms. 
“It is great news to the beach soccer family as the facility would help to grow the game. Our aim is to take the game to the next level and we believe that more people in the city will be interested in playing the game,” Mwachande said. 
Beach soccer is usually played in Salima, Mangochi, Nkhotakota and Mangochi districts. 
Beach soccer is growing in the country. Malawi National Beach Soccer Team finished as runners-up at the Cosafa Cup in Seychelles in 2016 and second at the Four-Nation Tournament in Tanzania last year.
