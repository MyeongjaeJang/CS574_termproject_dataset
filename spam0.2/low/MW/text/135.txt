Innovative African Future, a local organisation that promotes the use of technology in the agriculture sector, has urged farmers to start cultivating disease -resistant crops. 
This comes when some districts in the country have been hit by dry spell and the fall armyworm. 
“We have been having clinics and, through them, we have been teaching farmers about methods they can use to harvest more on a small piece of land,” said Innovative Africa Director, Chilala Katundu. 
Dedza is one of the districts that have benefitted from the initiative. 
Dedza District Agricultural Development Officer, Osmond Chapotoka, said farmers should embrace new methods of farming for them to make the best out of their pieces of land. 
The programme, which is being run by Chancellor College, under the department of Human Ecology, is being funded by the European Union.
