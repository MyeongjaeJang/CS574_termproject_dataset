First Merchant Bank (FMB) has increased sponsorship for the Under-20 Youth League from K25 million to K30 million, Group Head of Risk and Compliance, Willium Masamba, has announced. 
Masamba made the announcement at the bank’s head office in Blantyre on Thursday during media awards and 2018 league pre-launch ceremony. 
“We are also extending the league to two more districts, Salima and Nkhotakota, to make it 14 districts. Apart from contributing to sports development in the country, we believe that sporting activities keep away youngsters from indulging in bad behaviours such as drug abuse. 
“Through this league, over 100 teams will participate, which means that they will spend many hours preparing and playing games. 
We also applaud National Youth Football League [NYFA] for good management of the league in the past 10 years,” Masamba said. 
In response, NYFA President, Chimango Munthali, said: 
“Expanding to more districts is a sign that people have embraced youth football. This is like a nursery where we groom players for national teams.” 
Football Association of Malawi Executive Committee member, Daud Suleman, urged teams to ensure professionalism in the league, whose champions will now receive K1.5 million, up from K1 million. Runners-up will get K900,000, up from K600, 000. 
During the ceremony, Times Group’s reporter, Mphatso Malidadi, received the Best Photojournalist award, while Nation Newspapers’ Solomon Manda was named Best Print Journalist, among many other media awards.
