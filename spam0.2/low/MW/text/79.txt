GMT+2 02:02 Home National Christians in Way of the Cross IN CHRIST'S FOOTSTEPS—Archibishop Thomas Msusa leads Way of the Cross procession from Chichiri to Limbe Cathedral Christians in Way of the Cross Posted By: Feston Malekezo on: March 31, 2018 In: National No Comments GOOD FRIDAY— Anglicans and Catholics carrying out activities in Lilongwe 
Christians in the country Friday joined their global colleagues by taking part in Way of the Cross, a procession which sees them depicting the suffering that Jesus Christ, whom they regard as their savior, went through. 
Many of them, particularly Roman Catholics and Anglicans, could be seen in the country’s major cities and towns undertaking the procession, whose key moment was Jesus’ crucifixion. 
In Blantyre, Bishop of the Anglican Church of Southern Malawi Alinafe Kalemba urged Christians to avoid wrong-doing during the Easter period, stressing this is a period of meditation. 
He was leading the Way of the Cross procession which started from St Matthews Chichiri Parish of the Anglican Church to Holy Innocents in Limbe. 
“It is a period where Christians are called to meditate upon their life, to think of things that have separated them from Jesus Christ, confess their sins and be united with God. That is very important because it brings the Christian faith into reality. This also helps you to be in good relationship with other people,” he said. 
In Lilongwe, Catholics and Anglicans from St. Patrick’s and St Thomas churches respectively held a joint procession in Area 18 A and were joined by the country’s Vice President, Saulos Chilima. 
The Easter celebrations will reach a climax on Easter Monday which Christians believe was the day that their savior resurrected from the dead. 
But how relevant is Easter to modern Christianity? 
“It is still very relevant as it signifies the victory that Jesus Christ won for us when he died on the cross,” one of the congregants, Harrison Longwe said.
