Moses Kunkuyu, chairman of the Transformation Alliance, on Wednesday announced that he has joined the opposition Malawi Congress Party (MCP) 
Kunkuyu made the announcement in Blantyre at Malawi Sun Hotel and endorsed MCP president Lazarus Chakwera ahead of the 2019 tripartite elections. 
The former Minister of Information, who served under the late President Bingu wa Mutharika, said that the country’s politics and politicians are eroding the county’s democratic culture and freedom. 
His announcement means that MCP is attracting politicians in the southern region, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party stronghold. 
Last year, Sidik Mia, a former minister and well known southern region politician, was the first to join the MCP 
MCP is Malawi’s first ruling party that fought and lead Malawi to the first elections in 1964. The party has now rebranded under new leadership of Chakwera and for the first time ever, has the realistic chance of winning the next year’s elections. 
The Transformation Alliance unveiled a comprehensive document titled ‘The Malawi we want beyond 2019’ and outlined ways on how to move forward with it to meet its inspiring contents.
