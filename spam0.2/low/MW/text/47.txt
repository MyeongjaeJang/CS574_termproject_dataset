Home National Most caregivers untrained—Government WISER THAN BEFORE—Caregivers Posted By: Matilda Chimwaza on: March 26, 2018 
Ministry of Gender, Children, Disability and Social Welfare’s Quality Control Officer, Chikondi Chiumbuzo, has bemoaned low levels of training among caregivers in the country. 
Chiumbuzo said, out of 30,000 caregivers the country has, only 15,000 have the necessary skills. 
Chiumbuzo said this during a graduation ceremony held at Feed the Children Malawi office, where 22 caregivers completed a two-week training. 
He was, however, happy that Feed Malawi is striving to train more caregivers in early childhood development. 
“We, as the government, are really happy because it is the desire of the ministry to have caregivers who are well trained in early childhood development,” Chiumbuzo said. 
As one way of making sure that caregivers are trained and equipped with necessary skills, Feed the Children Malawi organised a two-week training for 22 caregivers from Thyolo and Mulanje districts. 
Feed the Children Malawi has a project that is encouraging inclusive early childhood development for children with disabilities in Mulanje and Thyolo districts. 
One of the graduates, Jinny Beula, said the training has enlightened her. 
“I have been equipped with the necessary skills and I will do my job to the best of my ability,” Beula said.
