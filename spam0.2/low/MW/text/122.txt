Northern Region Water Board (NRWB) has said it has managed to reduce water loss by 33 percent, down from 40 percent under the Water Demand Management Project being implemented in the city. 
About 50 percent of the population in Mzuzu live in informal settlements and face problems of water scarcity and poor sanitation services. 
Water Demand Management Project Officer, Foster Mkandawire, said the project has managed to control usage of water in the city of Mzuzu. 
“Water use efficiency is connected to the level of water which is conserved when usage is controlled and, as such, we have managed to reduce water loss through our colleagues at the water board,” Mkandawire said. 
NRWB Internal Audit Manager, Andrew Mhone, said the board losses more water in institutions that do not pay water bills. 
“Since we started this project, we have been able to achieve some goals in some areas but not all areas because we are still facing challenges to reduce non-revenue water [loss], which is still at 20 percent. 
“It is sad that some of the treated water is wasted because some people in institutions and communities do not conserve water,” Mhone said. 
He added that there is need for people to ensure that they save water. 
NRWB is working with Mzuzu City Council, Plan Malawi and VitensEvides International to sensitise people to the importance of conserving water. 
The project was launched in 2013.
