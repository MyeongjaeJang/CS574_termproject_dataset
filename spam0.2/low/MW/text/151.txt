Representatives of Sunbird Tourism Limited have said clients wishing to patronise Lilongwe Hotel should expect top customer experience following renovations at the hotel. 
The project has seen all 94 rooms at the hotel being refurbished. 
This came out during a bookers’ cocktail that the hotel organised for its clients over the weekend. 
Group Sales and Marketing Manager at Sunbird Tourism Limited, Levie Nkunika, without divulging how much the company has spent on the rehabilitation project, said the aim was to raise the standard of the hotel as a market leader. 
“As you are aware, Sunbird is the biggest hotel chain in the country and we always want our properties to be under a certain high standard. Therefore, we embarked on a project to renovate and refurbish the hotel to state-of-the art room formats, with all the amenities of a modern room meeting international standards,” Nkunika said. 
He was quick to point out that the move does not mean the hotel will increase charges on its services. 
“This will not lead to an increase in rates. We will maintain our charges to make sure we delight our customers. We want to serve them better and we will keep improving based on the feedback that they give us,” Nkunika said. 
During the cocktail, clients were treated to music performances and there was a raffle draw, where various prizes were handed out.
