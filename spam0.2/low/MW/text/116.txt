A few days after former first lady Calista Mutharika blasted the ruling party and advised people against supporting corrupt leaders, Nkhoma Synod of the Church of Central Africa Presbyterian (CCAP) Sunday took its turn and cautioned its members against voting for leaders who defend thieves and promote cashgate 
In a message read in all Nkhoma Synod churches Sunday, titled ‘Remaining Salt and Light in the Evil and Crooked World’, the men of God ask their members to vote for people that have no record of corruption and those that do not have a spirit of nepotism, tribalism and regionalism. 
“Do not vote for leaders who are liars, vote for people who will make good promises and fulfill them. Also vote for people who do not defend thieves and promote Cashgate in order to benefit their political parties,” says the letter signed by Biziwick Nkhoma, Synod Moderator. 
Among other tips, the Church says Malawians should consider voting for people that have genuine concerns in uplifting the lives of people and candidates that will not force State enterprises to finance activities of their political party. 
“Vote for people who will not reduce our respected traditional leaders to puppets,” further says the message. 
The synod has since asked the government to stop manipulating traditional leaders to lose their dignity and integrity. 
“We have noted with dismay and despondency that many chiefs are being enticed into party politics. It is sad that other chiefs have openly campaigned for the ruling governing party and have been elevated.” it says.
