Home National Chief Justice lauds Mec Chief Justice lauds Mec 
Chief Justice Andrew Nyirenda has urged stakeholders to follow procedures when referring electoral issues to the courts, adding that there are procedures for handling election-related complaints. 
Nyirenda said this during an orientation exercise conducted by the Malawi Electoral Commission (Mec). 
Nyirenda also asked Mec to raise awareness on new systems put in place to address election-related issues. 
He also said there was need to ensure that voters 
understand biometric voter registration processes to avoid cases of confusion. 
Mec Chairperson, Jane Ansah, said the electoral body has already briefed journalists and legislators on the new system to clear any misunderstandings. 
She said the introduction of the new voter registration system to stakeholders was meant to improve efficiency. 
“We [also] approached the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs to amend [some] provisions of some of our laws so that the national identity cards can be the only document for the purpose of identifying eligible voters,” she said.
