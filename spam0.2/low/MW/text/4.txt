Home Business Work on Africa Factbook starts TWISTED—Most stories told about Africa are not authentic Work on Africa Factbook starts Posted By: Grace Thipa   Business No Comments 
The African Factbook project has been launched to serve as Africa’s official source of facts and information. 
The project was conceived after realising that, despite its growth potential, Africa still lacks an authentic and comprehensive home-grown source of data and information. 
In order to address this information gap, the African Union Commission in 2016 signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Book of African Records, mandating the commission to publish the Africa Factbook. 
A statement issued by the secretariat of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa indicates that the MoU contains a provision for member countries within the Africa region to adopt the Africa Factbook as an educational tool to enhance their knowledge of, and pride in, Africa. 
“The Africa Factbook seeks to cover gaps in the continuum of knowledge management, particularly the absence of a comprehensive, reliable home-grown reference source on Africa by Africans,” reads the statement. 
Africa’s vision for development is outlined in the Agenda 2063 and anchored in the globally agreed Sustainable Development Goals. 
But, while these two development frameworks address development across political, economic, social, technological and environmental sector, among others, they also acknowledge data and information as a key building block to the continent’s development agenda.
