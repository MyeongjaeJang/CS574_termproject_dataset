There is no need to sacrifice style for security. Add a bit of elegance to your front door with the Weiser San Clemente handleset, which is also a Smartkey lock.

You can safely leave them a key knowing that when you return, you can put your lock back to its original setting so the spare key will no longer work. Safe and secure from anywhere.
