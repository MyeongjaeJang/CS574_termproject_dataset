QATAR Red Crescent Society (QRCS) Director-General (Relief and International Development) Rashid Saad al Mohannadi visited Nepal to explore potential cooperation in the field of humanitarian action there.
The Ambassador of Qatar to Nepal HE Yusuf bin Mohamed al Hail met with Mohannadi at the Embassy in Kathmandu. They reviewed cooperation between QRCS and the Qatar Embassy and the services rendered by QRCS in the country. Mohannadi presented an honorary shield to the ambassador in recognition of his personal support of QRCS's Representative Mission in Nepal.
Over two days, Mohannadi held several meetings with top government officials, including Shankar Hari Acharya, Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs and Director of the National Emergency Operation Centre, and Yubaraj Bhusal, CEO of the National Reconstruction Authority (NRA).
Presentations were made on the work of government relief bodies in relation to disaster management, donor relations, and reconstruction, and possible areas of cooperation between QRCS and the Government of Nepal were discussed.
Mohannadi emphasised QRCS's special support for humanitarian action in Nepal, joining hands with government partners in both relief and development."This translates into coordination visits to see how to take part in national development and reconstruction plans," he said.
He also met International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) Country Office Head Juja Kim, Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) Chairman Sanjiv Thapa, and NRCS Secretary-General Dev Ratna Dhakhwa.
Those organisations appreciated QRCS's role in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. They put forward the major challenges to humanitarian operations and the possible solutions to overcome them.
"QRCS's work in Nepal is two-directional: disaster response and long-term development. A top priority for us is to build the capacity of fellow national societies," Mohannadi said.
