Commercial Bank (CBQ) plans to issue bonds worth $1 billion soon. The bonds will be channelled to markets around the world, especially in Asia, and Australia, a statement said on Tuesday.
The bank's General Manager of Investments and Strategies, Parvez Khan, made this disclosure on the sidelines of a Commercial Bank Forum held on Tuesday. The forum included members and investors from Commercial Bank and the National Bank of Oman (NBO). The second largest bank in Oman, NBO held a roadshow in Doha to tap the growing business opportunities in Qatar.
Khan said Commercial Bank is working on issuing bonds in the Asian market in Formosa, Taiwan, worth between $250 million and $300 million. He said if the markets are ready to accept these bonds, they will be issued by the end of April.
Bonds for the Australian market, estimated to worth around $200 million, will be issued in May as per the market conditions.
In addition, Khan said there was a possibility of the bank issuing bonds worth $500 million in the global market after the month of Ramadan, within its medium-term bonds programme.
As part of the NBO-organised roadshow, a delegation of the bank held a meeting with Qatari businessmen at the Commercial Bank headquarters in Doha to showcase various business opportunities available in the two countries.
Qatar's Commercial Bank, which holds almost 35 percent stake in NBO, has a strategic alliance and works in close partnership with the Oman's second largest bank.
Speaking on behalf of Commercial Bank Chairman Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali bin Jabor al Thani, the bank's EGM and head of wholesale banking Raju Buddhiraju said holding the roadshow at Commercial Bank in Doha is part of a tradition of close collaboration between NBO and Commercial Bank.
