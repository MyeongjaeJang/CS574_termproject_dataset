The second edition of Tarsheed Carnival, organised by the Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation (Kahramaa), kicked off Kahramaa Awareness Park on Thursday.
Speaking on the sidelines of the launch of the event, Abdulaziz al Hammadi, director of Rationalization and Energy Efficiency, said that Tarsheed Carnival will be held for one week each year. The Carnival was launched for the first time last year.
He added that the main goal of Carnival is to raise awareness about rational use of electricity and water to achieve water and electric sustainability.
Hammadi pointed out that the Carnival also aimed at the community's participation in the goals of rationalisation and educating future generations about the importance of electricity and water and the importance of rationalisation in their use.
Tarsheed programme aims to reduce water consumption per capita by 15 percent and electricity by eight percent by 2022.
The Carnival will include many events and awareness activities for the public and private school students with a number of events celebrating Qatar.
The opening of the Carnival coincided with the World Water Day being marked on March 22 and the start of the Gulf Conservation Week to be held on Saturday, March 24.
The events are held in morning and evening sessions. While the morning session focuses on school students from 8am to 12pm, the evening session is open to the public from 4pm to 10pm.
