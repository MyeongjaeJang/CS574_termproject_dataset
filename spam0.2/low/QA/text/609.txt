Students India, an Indian students group, opened its annual book bank that aims to collect used text books and redistributing them among underprivileged students. The forum stated that the initiative has benefited a large number of students. The initiative has also inspired students to get involved in social service that benefits the entire society.
Text books from Class I to XII can be deposited in a Book Bank that functions at the office of Indian socio-cultural organisation, Youth Forum, located at Al Hilal until March 27. The distribution of books will be done from March 28 to 31 at the same office. In an effort to reach the maximum number of parents and students, the forum has made a strong collection and distribution network coordinating with different schools, teachers, students and parents.
"The programme has benefited more than 1,000 families last year," an office-bearer said. Further details about Book Bank are available at 66739213 , 30485351 , 70252171.
