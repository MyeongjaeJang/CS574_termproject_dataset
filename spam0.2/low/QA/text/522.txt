Commercial Bank customers won QR295,000 in the 'Save & Win Campaign' that rewards savers with 365 cash prizes throughout the year, including a QR1 million grand prize draw.
February marked the Save & Win Campaign's half waypoint and second quarterly draw, wherein two customers won QR50,000 and another two won QR30,000 each.
Besides, the four quarterly winners, the 29 regular monthly winners for February were announced, taking the total of cash prize winners to 182 since the campaign was launched in September 2017.
All winning customers were selected by an electronic draw, with the monthly winners comprising: five customers winning QR10,000, 10 customers winning QR5,000, and 14 customers winning QR2,500.
Commercial Bank EGM, Consumer Banking, Amit Sah said,"Save & Win is our way of saying thank you to our customers while encouraging them to save for the future. We've had a great experience over the last six months spending time with our customers at the monthly prize-giving ceremonies.
"We've given away 182 cash prizes so far with a number of customers winning more than once and we still have more prizes to give away in the next six months, plus the QR1 million grand prize."
All Commercial Bank customers with a minimum average balance of QR10,000 each month in their basic Current or Saving account are automatically entered into the monthly draw. The more customers save, the greater their chances winning one of the 365 cash prizes as each QR1,000 qualifies them for an entry coupon into an electronic draw.
Customers can earn double coupons for every QR1,000 average balance incremental versus the previous month, thus improving their chances to win.
If the minimum average balance of QR10,000 is maintained for 12 consecutive months, the customer qualifies for the grand prize draw of QR1 million.
All winners are notified following the draw, and customers are not restricted to the number of prizes they can win.
