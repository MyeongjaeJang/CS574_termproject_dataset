In recent years, children's mental well-being has emerged as the top priority for educationists throughout the world. Of late, an alarming increase in the number of dysfunctional families, and the attention deficit that children from such backgrounds suffer, have put the onus of channelling the energy and attention of all children to optimal functioning and to direct their feelings towards right behaviour, on schools and similar stakeholders. Every school has, thus, a greater responsibility to handle such children with utmost care.
In short, one of the foremost priorities of a school today relates to working towards optimising the functioning of children's positive thoughts and feelings towards right behaviour.
The 'feel good' factor is very essential for every child to give his/her best and feel on the top of the world. It helps the child to take decisions and work accordingly at an optimum level.
What differentiates humans from the rest of the animal kingdom is man's higher order emotional intelligence, and human beings alone are gifted with logic and reasoning that plays an important role in the foundation of culture and civilisation and also towards man's progress to a higher evolutionary status.
Teachers and parents have to train children to develop emotional intelligence. The child should be able to identify a variety of emotions so that he/she can learn to control and regulate these constructively.
A child's mental health is affected by various factors like, behaviour/reaction of parents, teachers, peers and society. It can also be affected by a traumatic incident he/she experiences, the effect of reading a book, interaction on the social media, watching a television show, etc. Yet, of course, the impact of these will emerge when he/she is in solitude, or, it could happen when he/she is among many classmates or schoolmates. Here are some tips for teachers and parents (of course, for students too) to tackle and to create an environment for training students to handle 'emotions':-
☛ For introducing positivity and optimism into the 'mix', one has to overlook trivial things and appreciate significant things on merit. A sense of faith and trust in the Almighty is a great factor in them thinking positively about the future. Hence, teach them to see positive traits in even bad/unfavourable situations and tell them,"Thank God, it's not so worse that we can't handle it. Maybe, its blessing in disguise."
☛ We must teach children the art of resilience to make them capable of withstanding or recovering quickly from an adverse situation. We generally have an opinion about childhood that it is carefree and the best part of life, yet, the emotional hurt and trauma many children face is severe.
A Uncief report describes close to 300 million, 3 in 4 children aged 2 to 4 worldwide, experience violent discipline by caregivers on a regular basis and around 250 million are punished physically. This is alarming as it impacts the child lifelong.
Scientists claim that the vital neural pathways formed during the first 1,000 days of life from conception to age 2, shape the rapidly developing brain.
It is well established that these connections require adequate nutrition and stimulation. Now there is a third and most vital element added, which is protection from violence that can result in toxic stress.
☛ It's very important to correctly regulate emotions. We must teach our children the ability to identify and control emotions.
As most of their working style, pace and interest are emotion-driven, they must be trained to adjust their behaviour according to the situation.
Monitoring and remembering appropriate emotions according to a situation is an art, for eg, the mindset before an exam, or even while going to school. Parents may remind children to recall good/happy moments of the past so that they can regulate their behaviour themselves.
I tell my students, before coming to school"go in front of the mirror and remind yourself by straightening your tie,"I am the best". (i.e. the best version of myself). By this, they will be able to monitor their behaviour without getting influenced.
☛ A child's self-esteem is paramount for his mental health, and by giving him due importance at home or in class we may keep it intact. The sense of self-esteem allows him to think beyond the limitation and speak out his/her mind, which sometimes may be very original and unique in nature.
☛ Socialisation for children is a must to develop appropriate communication skills. They need playmates to feel happy and to share their age-appropriate emotions. Initially, parents may act as playmates by behaving like them but after the age of five, children seek the same-age peer group. Sometimes children from diverse backgrounds and cultures bring a remarkable value system in the group.
☛ A healthy diet helps them utilise their brains to an optimum for that 'feel-good' mood. Give them a feeling that they are safe at home and at school by taking care and giving them the precautions against hazards. Protection from violence can save children from toxic stress.
☛ Negative phrases are to be avoided when a parent or teacher says,"Why can't you do things right?" or"How many times have I told you not to do this?" This makes a child feel flawed or weakens him/her.
☛ Avoid comparisons with siblings or relatives or neighbours. It depletes your child's self-image.
☛ Parents and teachers are role models for them, and hence, these individuals have to be very careful in choosing appropriate words and actions. They emulate their parents/teachers in inter-personal relations and their conversations. As communications expand, a child understands social behaviour and expectations from him/her.
☛ It is very important in the formative years of the child to pick up good references from family, school, society and even TV programmes. It's better to play age-appropriate videos for them, which they can relate to.
☛ In the initial years, every child is an attention-seeker, and hence, parents must reflect and react on merit.
☛ Children must be taught to be independent right from early years in areas that are appropriate for their age. They must be taught about 'good touch', 'bad touch' and privacy of body parts etc. Also, they must be taught to be careful while dealing with strangers in the absence of care givers, for eg, not to accept anything from strangers in the absence of a family member/teacher.
☛ We must sow seeds of gratitude, love, acceptance, forgiveness, compassion, etc, practising these virtues in front of them. These golden values will make them emotionally strong.
☛ Children must be trained to handle anger and how to respond to it right from their formative years. It is important as it affects child emotionally adversely. We have to explain to them to restrain and display with desirable courtesy.
TIPS FOR PARENTS, TEACHERS
* Avoid nagging, bribery and threats.
* Criticise the behaviour, not the child.
* Avoid sarcastic remarks.
* Praise them and win trust. Do not humiliate students in class (publicly) or at home or in front of a guest.
* Believe in them and in what they say (at least pretend, even if you don't)
* Express your love and show compassion (through hugs and by words). Listen to them and their feelings with patience.
* Validation of expression of emotion with a soothing tone. Show that you are upset by using expressions such"I won't like it please". They will also emulate this tone to display their anger by controlling emotions.
* A child must be taught to accept differences in people. Teach them to welcome to all kinds of people, different in mannerisms and those different racially.
* Give them responsibility such as taking care of younger siblings or grandparents, or may be, evening brush time monitoring of the whole family.
* Do not yell at your child. It makes the child feel inferior or devalued.
* Appreciate, encourage, support and guide them
* Don't send them out of the class as a teacher and don't starve them as a parent.
* Train them how to behave with a stranger in your presence and absence.
* Be a role model ( as a teacher or parent)
