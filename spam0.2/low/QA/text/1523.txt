Berlin: Werder Bremen have given coach Florian Kohfeldt a three-year contract until June 2021 after he has helped guide the Bundesliga club away from the relegation zone.
Kohfeldt, 35, began the season as Under-23 coach but took over the first team after the dismissal of Alexander Nouri at the end of October. Nouri had enjoyed success in the second half of the previous season when he took Werder from relegation danger to close to Europa League qualification, but a poor start to the current campaign had left the team second to bottom following 10 games without a win. Werder are now 12th after winning 31 points in 18 games under Kohfeldt and look to be safe from relegation danger. The club said Tuesday it was also offering long-term contracts to assistant coaches Tim Borowski and Thomas Horsch, goalkeeping coach Christian Vander and other members of the team around Kohfeldt.
