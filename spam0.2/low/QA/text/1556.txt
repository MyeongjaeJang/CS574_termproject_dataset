Barzan Holdings has announced the launch of its first cyber security training programme in Qatar, in collaboration with the National Service Authority.
The announcement results from a series of agreements between the two sides, of which some were revealed to the public during the Doha Maritime Defence Exhibition and Conference (DIMDEX 2018).
A group of National Service recruits has been selected to participate in the programme, Barzan Holdings said in a press release.
The cyber security training programme began on March 25 and will last for 15 days, with a total of 120 training hours using specialised cyber security hardware and software. The training course was designed in collaboration with Barzan Holdings' strategic partner Raytheon, recognised as a global leader in military technology and cyber security.
The project aims to enable participants to understand the basics of cyber security and the latest technology in this field, enhancing their ability to address potential risks and future threats. The recruits will then transfer their knowledge and experience to their workplaces across different sectors.
Barzan Holdings CEO Mohammed Mubarak al Khater said,"Cyber security is one of Barzan Holdings' most critical projects to enhance the defensive capabilities of various sectors in Qatar, and Barzan Holdings will be able to benefit from our strategic partnerships with leading international companies in this field."
Head of the National Service Authority Commander Saeed Hamad Al Nuaimi said,"We are continuously developing a series of professional National Service training programmes by designing specialised courses that take into account all military and security aspects. Cyber security is one of the most vital aspects of security and it is a top priority." (TNN)
