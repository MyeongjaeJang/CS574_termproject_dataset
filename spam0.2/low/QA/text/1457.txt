He called for joint action and international cooperation to face the challenges and to carry out in-depth studies to reach the best programmes that contribute to the elimination of the imminent danger.
He pointed out that Qatar is moving towards the elimination of terrorism and extremism and drying up its sources, and it is one of the leading countries to adopt law No. 3 of 2004 against terrorism and its subsequent amendments. He stressed that laws and amendments adopted by Qatar prove that it is always seeking to stand against anyone who tries to carry out a terrorist act that terrorises innocent people and spreads terror around the globe.
Dr Marri noted that Qatar is one of the safest countries and has remained at the forefront of the Middle East and North Africa in the World Peace Index. (QNA)
