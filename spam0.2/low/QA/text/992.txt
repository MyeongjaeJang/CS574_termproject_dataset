Piraeus, Greece
Around 100 Olympiakos supporters clashed with riot police outside a Piraeus hotel on Wednesday where they were protesting against perceived Greek government favouritism for their rivals.
Finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos was appearing at the hotel.
Police used tear gas to disperse the protestors while hooligans set garbage bins ablaze.
Olympiakos supporters had been invited on social media"to protest against those who fight against Olympiakos and want to disband the biggest athletic club in the world".
Over the last few days Olympiakos officials have suggested on social media that the leftist government is behind decisions by football authorities to punish the club.
On Monday, the Greek football federation rejected Olympiakos's request to get back three points deducted last month by the Super League over fan violence that overshadowed their 2-1 loss to AEK Athens.
The Piraeus club was also fined 90,000 euros and played two home matches behind closed doors.
The reigning champions are locked in a three-way battle with AEK and PAOK to win the league for a record eighth time in a row.
Earlier this month, PAOK successfully had their own three-point deduction overturned following protests by their supporters, some of whom invaded state-run television station ERT 3.
PAOK had been punished after their match with Olympiakos was called off when a cashier's roll thrown by a fan hit opposition coach Oscar Garcia in the face.
