NEW DELHI: Pratt & Whitney will soon begin deliveries of spare engines to IndiGo airlines, which was forced to ground eight of its Airbus A320neo aircraft last week after engine problems, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
P&W, owned by United Technologies Corp, will deliver two engines on Wednesday and the remaining within the next 40 days, said the source who did not want to identified.
A series of in-flight engine failures prompted India's aviation regulator to ground 11 aircraft last week fitted with certain P&W engines and operated by IndiGo, the country's biggest carrier by market share, and rival GoAir. That led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and about a 5 percent fall in the share price of IndiGo's parent, InterGlobe Aviation, over the past week. A string of problems has clouded the rollout of P&W's new engines, with the US aviation regulator warning in February that some engines fitted on the narrow-body A320neo planes posed a shutdown risk. IndiGo and GoAir have hundreds of A320neo planes on order but they, among other carriers, are facing delivery delays due to problems with the engines. IndiGo said in a statement earlier on Tuesday it had cancelled no more than 35 to 45 flights a day, which is around 3 percent of its schedule. (reuters)
