JET Airways, India's leading airline, has reduced its excess baggage rates from Doha to its Indian destinations.
As per the new announcement, Jet Airways passengers can carry excess baggage up to 25kg for QR350.
Passengers travelling with Jet Airways from Tuesday onwards can avail these special rates at check-in.
Jet Airways Manager in Qatar Anshad Ebrahim said that the new, lower excess baggage rates in Doha allow Jet Airways passengers to take more baggage when visiting family and friends in India.
As per newly renewed tariff, the airline will charge QR44 for one kg excess baggage. With the QR44 charge, passengers can carry up to five kg.
According to the new announcement, price of excess baggage will be reduced while the weight of baggage is increased. Passengers can carry up to 10 kg for QR132, 15 kg for QR219 and up to 20 kg for QR263.
"The offer will also be a better opportunity for passengers who prefer ship cargo which requires more time, logistics and other formalities for delivery. This is the first time Jet Airways announces such an attractive offer for its passengers," Ebrahim added.
Jet Airways' normal baggage allowance to its Indian destinations is 30 kg to 40 kg. The new offers will be available at Jet Airways counter at check-in, city office and 'jetairways.com'.
