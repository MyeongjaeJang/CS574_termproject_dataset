The Ministry of Municipality and Environment (MME), represented by the Department of Public Parks, in cooperation with Abdullah Abdul Ghani and Bros on Monday announced the launch of the treasure hunt event, which will be held on Friday, March 23, 2018.
The event was announced at a press conference addressed by Director of Public Parks Department at MME Mohammed Ali al Khouri and CEO of Abdullah Abdul Ghani and Bros R K Murugan.
The aim of the event is to enhance the role of public parks in Qatar and to urge the residents to exercise safety on the road. The treasure hunt will be held in Al-Thamamah, Al-Dafna, Al-Gharafa, Bu Samra Park and Khalifa Park/Katifiya Park.
Khouri thanked all the organisers of the event, which is being organised for the second year in a row after the success of the last edition.
He stressed that the event is not particularly a race but an invitation to enjoy the environment and nature and the need to preserve them, describing it as a message to other companies to take care of the environment and support such initiatives.
He noted that the ministry supports every initiative that would be in the interest of parks and the environment, adding that the launch of a new electric vehicle that is environmentally friendly and reduced emissions is one of the most important initiatives to preserve the environment.
The Treasure Hunt 2018 will involve about 25 to 30 vehicles, each containing two to four participants. Teams will be distributed to the five parks. Participants will also be judged according to the time they spend answering questions and implementing activities in all identified parks.
The results and winners will be announced on the same day and awards will be distributed to the winners.
