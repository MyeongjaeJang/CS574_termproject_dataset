Qatar Green Building Council (QGBC), a member of Qatar Foundation (QF), has opened registration for organisations in Qatar who wish to take part in its annual ‘No Paper Day Qatar’ . 
The initiative, now in its sixth year, is part of QGBC’s ongoing efforts to help schools, companies, and institutions find ways to reduce paper consumption, engage the wider community in environmentally-friendly practices, and raise sustainability awareness. QGBC Director Engineer Meshal Al Shamari said they are delighted with the success of the campaign over the past years and they look forward to the continuing participation of their existing partners. He said that they are excited to welcome new partners on board. 
As in previous years, companies and individuals taking part in ‘No Paper Day Qatar’ are encouraged to start saving and collecting newspapers and magazines, office paper, cardboard, plastic bottles, plastic cups and jugs, and aluminium and steel cans. All collected recyclable waste should be dropped off at the QGBC Villa on 8-10 April . Participating companies will be invited to attend an appreciation event and will also receive QGBC-led sustainability training sessions at their premises.
