Qatar's Adel Abdulla held a tiny advantage of just 1.1 seconds in the T2 standings after the short tarmac super special stage at Yas Marina that kick-started the action in the 2018 Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge on Saturday afternoon.
Driving a Nissan Safari Y61 that he rented at the 11th hour, the Qatari carded a time of 1min 28.6sec and that gave him and navigator Nasser al Kuwari the narrowest of leads over Saudi Arabian rival Ahmed Shegawi. The Russian driver Yuliya Khegay-Migunova was a mere 1.9 seconds behind in third position.
Abdulla is running his T2 programme with the crucial support of the Qatar government, the Qatar Motor and Motorcycle Federation (QMMF) and Ooredoo Qatar.
Adel said after the SSS:"Today we started on the Yas Marina circuit. It was a new experience and the first time for me with the rally car on the circuit. We tried to push because I didn't want to start behind like we were last year.
"I'm happy to be leading my category and it is a good start to the Abu Dhabi Desert Challenger for us. We managed it very well," he added.
"Tomorrow is a long day. The plan is to drive sensibly and not to get stuck. As the organisers informed us, the dunes are much softer than last year. It's going to be quite a challenge to reach the bivouac safe. We hope to continue in the lead after the tough stage on the morrow."
The real meat of the off-road action starts on Sunday with a 276km selective section that starts to the south of Abu Dhabi and winds a sandy trail across remote gatch tracks and the first series of sand dunes before reaching the first of four overnight halts at a purpose-built bivouac, near Qasr Al-Sarab.
