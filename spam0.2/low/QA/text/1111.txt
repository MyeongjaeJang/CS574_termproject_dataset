QATAR University College of Health Sciences (QU-CHS) hosted the Salt Awareness Day recently, aiming at raising awareness about the salt content in everyday foods.
Organised in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), the event was attended by CHS faculty, staff and students. It featured booths by CHS departments of Biomedical Sciences and Public Health, and a nutrition clinic where graduate dietitians were on hand to advise visitors on the salt content in their daily diet, as well as interactive games and displays of hidden salts in local food products. Representatives from the Ministry of Public Health distributed brochures about salt content.
CHS Dean and Biomedical Research Center Director Prof Asma al Thani said:"We are honoured to collaborate with the Ministry of Public Health for such an important health initiative that aligns with the World Salt Awareness Week. Educating the community about the benefits and the dangers of salt intake is part of health care practitioners' role within the community."
CHS Human Nutrition Department Head Dr Tahra El-Obeid said:"Having our students organise and participate in such an event helps to apply the practical aspect of their learning. This event helps to increase consumer awareness about salt content in their diet and its relationship to health."
Student and event's organiser Amna al Ibrahim said:"The event aimed to raise awareness about salt consumption and its consequences on health, as well as to provide individuals with tips to reduce salt intake. It had a high turnout and the attendees seemed pleased with the interactive activities and education materials provided to them."
