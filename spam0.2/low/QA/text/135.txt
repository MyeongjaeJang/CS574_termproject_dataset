Qatar will play its first international friendly in 2018 against Iraq on Wednesday at Basra Sport City Stadium in Basra following a recent FIFA decision to lift the ban on holding official matches in Basra, Karbala and Erbil.
Qatar was instrumental in FIFA's decision to lift the ban on holding official matches in the three citities.
Felix Sanchez, the national team coach of Qatar and players arrived in Iraq on Tuesday. The players were given a warm reception on their arrival by their hosts.
The Spanish coach had announced a 21-man squad that will feature in the Three-Nation friendly Tournament, from March 22 to 27. Qatar will join teams from Syria and hosts Iraq who are set to welcome the football teams for the first time in decades. Sanchez headed a team training session on Sunday.
Qatar and Iraq have played 13 matches, with Qatar winning seven to Iraq's four and two drawn games. The last competitive match between both teams was the Gulf Cup in Kuwait last year where Iraq won 2-1.
Iraq has not played full internationals on home turf ever since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait that sparked an international embargo.
