LONDON
Sterling surged on Monday as Britain and the European Union agreed on a post-Brexit transition period and said that their divorce treaty would include an emergency"backstop" to avoid a hard border in Ireland.
The pound, which had already been rallying on expectations for a transition deal, gained further after the announcement by British Brexit minister David Davis and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.
Against the dollar it rose as much as 1 percent to $1.4088 , its strongest since Feb. 16 and the biggest one-day rise since January.
Versus the euro, sterling rose 0.8 percent to 87.45 pence per euro, its best level since Feb. 8.
"You now have a credible timeframe for reaching a full trade agreement," MUFG strategist Derek Halpenny said.
The headlines and sterling's reaction suggested a transition agreement had been reached more easily than the market had expected, he said.
Investors had largely expected Britain to secure a transition agreement at Thursday's EU summit, but concern remained that a deadlock over the Irish border would derail a deal.
Securing the terms of a transition phase was vital, because it means London and Brussels can now focus on what trading relationship the two sides have after Britain leaves the EU next year.
A transition deal also means little change in trading between the Britain and the EU between Britain's exit and the end of 2020. Sterling faces a pivotal week, with the Bank of England announcing an interest rate decision on Thursday after inflation and wages data.
It is expected to keep rates on hold but to prepare the market for a possible increase in May, a rise it had signalled as contingent on a transition agreement.
