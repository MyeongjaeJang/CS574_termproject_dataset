More than 100 people participated in a technical seminar organised by the Philippine Society of Mechanical Engineers (PSME) Qatar Chapter at the Crowne Plaza Hotel Doha recently.
The seminar on HVAC Cooling Load Calculation Part 2 (Duct Sizing and Pressure Drop Calculation) was conducted by previous PSME president Engr. Virtud Barraza.
According to PSME President Rene Cirio, the purpose of the seminar was to enhance the skills and abilities of members with regard to heating ventilation air conditioning (HVAC) design.
The event, he added, intended to help members earn points to comply with the continuing professional development (CPD) requirements of the Professional Regulation Commission in the Philippines.
"PSME Qatar Chapter was recognised by the Philippine Embassy Doha with the mission of uniting all practitioners exclusively to advance mechanical engineering, the allied arts and science and related human factors for the benefit of the general public. The Society will provide a venue for its members to participate and contribute in the social, economic and industrial growth of the country," Cirio said.
On the vision of the group, he added that the Chapter aspires to be the best provider of services to its members for them to become excellent performers in their profession, render valuable contributions to national development and become effective channels of global technology transfer. - Reports by Ailyn Agonia
