QATAR Foundation (QF) will host a series of running events designed to encourage members of the wider community to explore Education City (EC) and to get fit at the same time.
The EC Running Series, which will be held under the theme 'Your Route to discover Education City', is due to kick off on March 23 and will feature a number of distances, including 3km, 5km, 10km and 21km.
Machaille al Naimi, president, community development at QF, said:"Community development lies at the heart of everything we do at QF. The EC Running Series forms part of a wider, year-round campaign aimed at fostering a socially-engaged society while encouraging healthy lifestyles among the residents of Qatar."
The first race will start and finish at the new Qatar National Library building and all entrants will receive a specially-commissioned 'finisher medal', designed and produced by Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts in Qatar students Amna al Hardan, Shaikha M al Mansoor, Hamdah A Almal, Maha Nabina, Rudaina Abouid, Saja Elkabashand Noor A Janahi under the guidance of Assistant Professor Lin Han.
Participants will also be allocated race bibs printed by the Qatar National Library Press, while volunteers from Al Shaqab will be on duty during the run to provide marshalling and assistance along the course.
As well as taking part in the EC Running Series, the public are encouraged to visit QF's additional sports amenities such as Oxygen Park, a 130,000-square-metre open space incorporating sports, recreation and heritage areas, and the Al Shaqab Arena which specialises in equestrian heritage and culture.
