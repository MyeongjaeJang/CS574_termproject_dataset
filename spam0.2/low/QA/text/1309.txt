Strenger also accused Porsche, a member of Volkswagen's Porsche-Piech founding clan, of"inaction in pursuing misconduct" by the company's top managers over its diesel emissions scandal, the newspaper Quote: d the motion as saying.
Instead, Strenger said"truly qualified people" should be proposed to fill open seats on Volkswagen's supervisory board.
Strenger is a small shareholder, but a prominent voice in Germany as a former and founding member of the government's Corporate Governance Commission. He was previously a chief executive officer of DWS, the asset management arm of Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE).
Strenger and Volkwagen did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside of business hours on Sunday.
The press office of the Porsche division, where Wolfgang Porsche is also chairman of the supervisory board, did not respond to a request for comment.
