Cleveland Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue is to take a break from coaching after health concerns forced him from courtside for the third time this season, the team confirmed on Monday.
Lue left Saturday's 114-109 victory over the Chicago Bulls at halftime after complaining of feeling unwell. It came just over a month after he left the court during a game against Orlando on February 6.
Lue said in a statement on Monday he was stepping back from coaching duties after revealing he had been suffering from mystery chest pains.
"After many conversations with our doctors and (general manager) Koby (Altman) and much thought given to what is best for the team and my health, I need to step back from coaching for the time being and focus on trying to establish a stronger and healthier foundation from which to coach for the rest of the season," Lue said.
"I have had chest pains and other troubling symptoms, compounded by a loss of sleep, throughout the year. Despite a battery of tests, there have been no conclusions as to what the exact issue is."
ESPN reported that Lue expected to be back in time for the start of the playoffs next month, where the Cavs will be chasing a fourth consecutive appearance in the NBA finals.
Lue, 40, said he hoped to return rejuvenated after his break.
"My goal is to come out of it a stronger and healthier version of myself so I can continue to lead this team to the Championship we are all working towards," he said.
