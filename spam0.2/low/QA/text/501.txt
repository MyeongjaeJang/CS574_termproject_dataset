A health portal whereby patients will be able to communicate with their doctors and be up-to-date with their medical condition was launched on Saturday.
Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC) Managing Director Dr Mariam Abdulmalik said,"This will make the patients know about their health and the progress. All the patients should understand their case so as to take their medicines as prescribed," she said.
The portal will allow patients to have access to their medical records such as the scheduled appointments, the medicines they are taking, and medicines etc.
The patients can also add more information about their condition in the portal."The patient may share this information when they go to see a private clinician. It enables them to be more involved and have more information to better health outcomes," said Adrian Dey, Cerner Qatar General Manager. The portal is linked to the Qatar ID and it requires one to register and if one registers it will give access to all of those defined areas of your own medical record within the public healthcare system.
