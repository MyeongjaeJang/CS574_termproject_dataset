Australia's Cameron Bancroft and captain Steve Smith admitted to ball-tampering during the third Test against South Africa on Saturday, sending shockwaves through cricket.
Bancroft was caught on television cameras appearing to rub a yellow object on the ball, and later said:"I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. I want to be here (in the press conference) because I want to be accountable for my actions."
Smith added:"The leadership group knew about it."
Television footage appeared to show Bancroft, 25, take on object out of his pocket while fielding in the post-lunch session on the third day of the Test at Newlands.
He was spoken to by umpires Nigel Llong and Richard Illingworth during the 43rd over of South Africa's second innings after appearing to have the object in his hand after fielding the ball at cover.
While the umpires were conferring, Bancroft then appeared to place a small yellow object in his underpants.
When the umpires went across to talk to him he reached into a pocket and showed them what seemed to be a different object -- what looked like a soft pouch for sunglasses.
The umpires took no action and did not change the ball.
There were boos from a capacity crowd at Newlands when the incident was shown on the big screen at the ground.
Both Bancroft and Smith, who took over the Australian captaincy in 2015, appeared before the media after the match and admitted that they had attempted to change the condition of the ball.
"We had a discussion during the break. On myself I saw an opportunity to use some yellow tape and the granules from the rough patches of the wicket to change the condition of the ball,"said opening batsman Bancroft who is playing in his eighth Test.
"It didn't work, the umpires didn't change the ball. We have this yellow tape in our kit. The actual sticky stuff itself is very sticky so I felt it could be used to collect some stuff from the side of the pitch."
Smith will now face calls for his resignation after admitting that Bancroft did not act alone.
"The leadership group knew about it. We spoke about it at lunch. I'm not proud of what happened. It's not in the spirit of the game,"said the skipper.
Shane Warne, the Australian spin bowling great, said on Twitter he was"very disappointed" by the pictures and called on Australia captain Steve Smith to clear up the"mess" in the post-play press conference.
Aiden Markram and AB de Villiers batted South Africa into a strong position, leaving South Africa at 238 for five in their second innings when bad light ended play, an overall lead of 294. The series is tied at one match apiece.
Opening batsman Markram made 84 and De Villiers batted with unusual caution to be 51 not out at the close.
Markram, out for nought in the first innings, could have completed a"pair" but he was dropped off the fourth ball of the second innings when he edged Mitchell Starc low to the left of Usman Khawaja at gully.
He survived another much more difficult chance on 59 when Smith flung himself to his right at second slip and got his fingertips to a flying edge off Josh Hazlewood. Smith, who held a world record-equalling five catches in the first innings, had already added to his tally by catching first innings century-maker Dean Elgar off Pat Cummins for 14.
Markram, who made a century in the first Test in Durban, batted solidly despite his lapses and hit ten fours and two sixes in a 145-ball innings. He shared partnerships of 76 with Hashim Amla (31) and 47 with AB de Villiers, who was unbeaten on 18.
Markram was out in the last over before tea when he chipped Mitchell Starc to mid-on where Cummins held a low catch.
De Villiers opened his scoring with a slapped six off the back foot over cover off Cummins but it was the only scoring shot in the first 20 balls he faced as he made a cautious start to his innings.
De Villiers looked determined to bat until deep in the innings and had faced 103 balls by the close.
South Africa bowled out Australia for 255 at the start of the day, a first innings lead of 56, with Australia adding ten runs before losing their last wicket.
Australia's last batsman, Josh Hazlewood, hit two fours off Kagiso Rabada before he was caught by Amla at first slip off Rabada off the 17th ball of the day.
In contrast to the first two days, the weather was cool and cloudy and bad light ended play about 40 minutes early.
