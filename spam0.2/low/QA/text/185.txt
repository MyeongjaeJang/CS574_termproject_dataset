ASTER marked a historic day with conducting 2,439 free kidney function tests in Industrial Area as part of the Aster Volunteers programme and in connection with World Kidney Day 2018.
The free tests were conducted at Aster Medical Centre near the footbridge and street one in Industrial Area on March 16 from 7am to 9pm.
Aster Volunteers is a CSR initiative of Aster DM Healthcare which seeks to bridge the gap between people who like to help those in need.
Commenting on the achievement, Dr Sameer Moopan, chief executive officer, Aster DM Healthcare Qatar, said:"Early diagnosis is critical in the treatment of any disease. As we celebrate our 15th anniversary in Qatar, this initiative by Aster Volunteers reinforces our commitment to making quality healthcare accessible to all. Aster Volunteer programme is a testimony to our efforts to empower the individuals who want to make a positive impact on society and extend a helping hand to the less privileged."
Dr Joy P George, urologist at Aster, said:"According to the recent statistics of Hamad Medical Corporation's Nephrology Department, one in ten Qatar residents has some form of kidney disorder. It may not become apparent that a person has kidney disease until his kidney function is significantly impaired. Kidney disease can affect people of all ages and races and it is important that we use the occasion of World Kidney Day, marked on the second Thursday of March annually, to educate members of the community about how important this vital organ is and what they can do to protect it."
Aster Volunteers is a healthcare and wellness initiative of Aster DM Healthcare that focuses on spreading hope and connecting people who like to help those in need. Earlier this year, Aster Volunteers conducted several activities such as free medical camp, awareness sessions and distribution of winter jackets to fishermen.
