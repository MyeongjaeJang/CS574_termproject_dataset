THE sixth Doha Forum for Policies and Strategies called on major world powers to put pressure on the siege countries to end the Gulf crisis and to ensure the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) which is collapsing under the influence of the crisis.
The Forum emphasised in its final statement, which was read out by Director of the Directorate of International Studies and Chairman of the Forum's Preparation Committee Bridger (Pilot) Rashid Hamad al Naimi, the need to pay attention to"the changes in the map of political and economic relations between the Gulf States and their reflections on the map of regional and international alliances in the Middle East".
The statement called on the educated elite in the Gulf countries to play a positive role in preventing the negative impact of the crisis on popular mentality and to protect communication between relatives.
In another context, the statement stressed the need to preserve the legal and religious status of Jerusalem and to confront attempts to its Judaization as well as ending any differences that would distract efforts and the need to support the besieged Palestinian people.
It also called on the international community to shoulder its responsibilities to end the painful and escalating conflicts in the Middle East, stressing that the resulting damages will not exclude anyone from their cross-border threats nature and the collective action they require.
It pointed to the need to pay attention to the changes taking place in the economic policies of some countries, which represent a decline and a challenge to global economic policies and freedom of trade and globalisation.
At the end of the forum, Commander of the Strategic Studies Center at the Ministry of Defence HE Maj. General Dr Hamad Mohammed al Marri praised the positive contributions made by the participants in the forum, which included presenting ideas, analyses and discussions.
The two-day forum, organised by the Center for Strategic Studies at the Ministry of Defence in cooperation with the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies, discussed the Gulf crisis and the dimensions of new alignments in the Middle East, among other topics.
