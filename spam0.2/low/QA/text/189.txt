Qatar Charity (QC) has launched the 'Food Basket for Workers' Campaign to support those working on farms and construction sites in recognition of their services to the country.
The campaign aims to develop the spirit of compassion and harmony among the members of the society and strengthen the links between different strata of the society.
Ali al Gharib, executive director of QC's Executive Management for local operations, said the campaign targets 1,000 workers across the country and is complementary to the 'Winter of Workers' Campaign launched in the malls and commercial places in the beginning of the season.
QC has started promoting the campaign through a number of marketing campaigns organised at Hayat Plaza and Ezdan Mall. The charity continues to mobilise support for the campaign at Ezdan Mall on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, where QC volunteers are available to receive donations from citizens and residents.
Gharib thanked the management of the commercial complexes for their cooperation in implementing QC's programmes within the framework of strengthening the humanitarian, developmental and relief action within the country.
Gharib also thanked the benefactors for their remarkable response to the QC's 'Food Basket for Workers' Campaign of and urged them to continue supporting it.
Donations can be made to the campaign through QC's website (qcharity.org) and App. Also, people can donate at the QC headquarters, branches and collection points located in commercial complexes as well as through the hotline (44667711).
Earlier, QC distributed a number of masks to workers to protect them from dust, aiming to mitigate the impact of the sandstorms witnessed by the state in the past few days.
