QATAR Islamic Bank (QIB), Qatar's leading Islamic Bank, organised its annual blood donation campaign in association with Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) at its headquarters on Banks Street between 8am and 12pm on March 27.
The campaign was organised in order to replenish supplies of the HMC blood bank and came as part of the bank's multiple initiatives that aim to strengthen its involvement in key matters that affect the people in Qatar. The campaign received a strong response from employees who work at various QIB departments and customers who turned up to donate blood and give back to the community.
The event was attended by Bassel Gamal, QIB's Group CEO, other senior representatives of the bank, and two of the most prominent Qatari social media influencers Hassan al Sai and Fahad Buzwair.
"QIB always goes far in serving the community," said Gamal, adding,"We are proud at the same time to see the turnout at this year's event. It's one of the simplest things that we can do to help make a difference and save lives." (TNN)
