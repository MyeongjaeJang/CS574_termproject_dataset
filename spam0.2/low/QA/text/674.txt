A magnificent century by opener Nafees failed to inspire Qatar Diar as they suffered a five-wicket loss at the hands of Warriors Club during a Qatar Airways Cricket Tournament for the Premier Division teams at the West Bay Grounds.
Asked to set the target, Qatari Diar piled up a formidable-looking 312 for eight in 50 overs. Nafees and Amir laid a solid base with an opening stand of 126 runs. Amir was the first to go out after hitting 55 off 59 balls with nine boundaries.
This alliance was followed by another good partnership of 87 runs for the second wicket, shared by centurian Nafees and Yousef, who contributed 41 with two sixes and as many fours.
However, Umar and Murad picked three wickets each, which enabled Warriors Club to rally back and apply brakes on the rivals. Nafees finished unbeaten on 135. His 139-ball hundred was studded with seven sixes and 13 boundaries.
Warriors Club capitalised on not-so-impressive bowling by the opponents and strung together two healthy partnerships to fuel the chase, wrapping up the five-wicket victory with 33 balls to spare.
It was Imraz and Adnan who collected 80 runs for the opening wicket. Imraz got 35 with four boundaries and Adnan made 27. Praveeth and Murad then hit 87 runs for the fourth wicket to take the score to 234. Murad smashed a six and three fours in his 48-ball 38, while Praveeth was the fifth player out after getting a fine 62, which came off 57 deliveries with a six and five fours.
Assad and Faizal provided the icing on the cake with the unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 59 runs. The former clobbered one six and half a dozen fours to compile 54 in 35 balls and Faizal got 15 not out. Qatari Diar captain Omran grabbed two wickets for 62.
In another match, Awais Malik and Zubair blasted 183 runs for the first wicket to set up a crushing nine-wicket victory for HBK against Royal Stars, who folded up at 188 in 43.2 overs.
Zibran (four for 30) and Malik took six wickets between them to skittle out the rivals for a small total. Awais (45 with a six and four boundaries) and Noor (37 with six fours) were the top scorers for their team.
Malik then joined Zubair to launch the brisk pursuit, clinching the win in just 21.5 overs. While Man-of-the-Match Malik hammered a dozen fours in his 70-ball 95, Zubair was unbeaten on 78. His 61-ball knock had a six and 11 fours.
