THE Cultural Village Foundation (Katara) hosted three art exhibitions starting with the 'Calligraphy and Art' exhibition of the Turkish artist Murat Kurt, followed by 'Connected' art exhibition by artist Shahida Ahmed and 'Creative Steps' by a group of students.
The opening was attended by Ahmed Abdelrahman al Sayyed, Deputy General Manager of Katara, and HE Fikret Ozer, the Turkish Ambassador in Doha, and several artists and enthusiasts.
Katara aims, through these exhibitions, to enhance the cultural movement in Qatar and exchange cultures with the world.
Turkish artist Murat displayed in his exhibition 20 artworks that included poetry and verses from the Holy Quran in a fascinating way, which he described saying:"I was inspired by the love of Ottoman poetry and converted that into artworks and found calligraphy the best method to interpret them as it reflects what's in our hearts and provides a better chance to express more."
On this occasion, the ambassador said that the exhibition enhances relations between Qatar and Turkey and such artworks reflect the most significant part of the Islamic art, which is calligraphy."The Arabic calligraphy is getting so much attention in Turkey, especially that it was always used to decorate mosques and palaces," Ozer added.
Artist and sculptor Shahida said that she was inspired by the 'Darwish Dance' and mainly used black and white colours in her 25 paintings."This is my very first art exhibition in the Middle East. Art is a universal dialogue with no restrictions or barriers. It is a form of expression," she added.
Moreover, the art exhibition 'Creative Steps' which was opened in building 22 included more than 50 art works by 16 students.
The exhibition 'Connected' will continue until March 29 at building 19, while the exhibition 'Calligraphy and Art' at building 18 and 'Creative Steps' exhibition at building 22 will continue until March 30.
