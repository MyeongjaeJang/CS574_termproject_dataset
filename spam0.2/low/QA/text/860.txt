QATAR University (QU) Library hosted a session on 'How to verify fake news in social media platforms' in Doha on Monday.
The session is part of a series of events and initiatives organised by QU to provide academic and scientific studies on the current Gulf crisis and to analyse the illegal blockade imposed on Qatar.
The session featured a panel discussion moderated by Prof Mohamed Kirat, Professor of Public Relations at QU College of Arts and Sciences (CAS). It included presentations by CAS Associate Professor of Mass Communication Dr Jamel Zran, Researcher at Al Jazeera Centre for Studies Dr Mohamed Erraji, Assistant Professor in Department of Library & Information Science (DLIS) at the Public Authority for Applied Education and Training (PAAET) Dr Husain F Ghuloum, and Associate Professor of Mass Communication at CAS Dr Leon Barkho.
They discussed a wide range of issues such as 'Media between the present and the past: What are the changes and the impact of social media on traditional media?', 'How to interpret fake news by presenting a sample of intellectual news and a specific case study', 'Fighting electronic rumors and fake news', and 'Fake news: Impact and ways to detect them'.
In her remarks, Samia al Shiba said:"Libraries play an essential role in guiding the beneficiaries of information and reliable sources and in raising the awareness of researchers about media and information literacy. In this regard, the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions designed an infographic to spot fake news through eight steps. The Library also established a database themed 'The Qatar's Blockade' that includes the publications on the Gulf crisis by QU members." (TNN)
