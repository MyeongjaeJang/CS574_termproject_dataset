The ninth edition of Qatar International Food Festival (QIFF) kicked off at the Hotel Park with the spotlight on world renowned celebrity chefs during the opening programmes. Wolfgang Puck sat with Qatari chef Aisha al Tamimi for a Q&A while Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto captivated the festival visitors with a demonstration on carving an almost 80kg tuna.
With 177 kiosks offering international cuisine, QIFF can take visitors, young and old, on a culinary journey around the world. As in the previous year, a special zone has been designated to nine embassies. This year, Ethiopia, India, Lebanon, Mexico, Philippines, South Africa, Turkey USA and Vietnam are offering their distinct tastes and will present cooking demonstrations.
On the opening day, visitors started to arrive as the sun was setting, many browsing the culinary offerings and some enjoying the view of West Bay while sitting on the grassy slope at the park. Before the festival officially opened, tables and benches were almost fully occupied with men, women and children enjoying their choice of food, savoury, sweet and spicy.
Mascots and magicians entertained at different areas of the festival ground to the delight of children while Arab musicians gave a slice of the local culture, setting its mood right.
Additional attractions for children, and for adults too, are the mini zoo, a Kids' Zone cinema hosted by DFI and daily fireworks at 8 pm.
Live performances, cultural shows and a farmers' market are also elements in this year's festival. There are also brands conducting fun games for adults and children and are giving away prizes. Make sure to spot them.
The festival will run until March 25 and is open from 4 pm till midnight from Saturday to Wednesday, and from 4 pm till 1 am on Thursdays and Fridays.
