UCL Qatar has presented to the Museum of Islamic Art (MIA) library and Qatar National Library (QNL) a new children's book that brings to life innovative and ground breaking archaeological work being done at the ancient Royal City of Meroe, as part of the Qatar-Sudan Archaeological Project (QSAP).
Named 'Sudan's Ancient History: Hwida and Maawia Investigate Meroe's Iron', the book follows two young characters as they uncover how ancient people produced iron. One hundred copies of the book will be placed in the Doha libraries for children and families from across Qatar to enjoy and learn about this aspect of Sudan's rich heritage.
As part of the ongoing community outreach programme in Sudan, hundreds of books were also handed out to children living around Meroe and placed in the libraries of local schools.
The books were given to MIA and QNL at a ceremony attended by Ambassador of Sudan HE Fathalrahman Ali Mohammed and Dr Abdelrahman Ali, director-general of the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums in Sudan (NCAM).
Funded by Qatar Museums (QM), QSAP is an extensive, targeted initiative to support the exploration and protection of Sudan's culture and history. Led by the states of Sudan and Qatar, this international project has over 40 missions engaged in the excavation and conservation of ancient sites in Sudan.
For the last six years, UCL Qatar has been carrying out archaeological work in Meroe on the east bank of the river Nile. UCL Qatar's most recent work as part of QSAP includes the discovery of early iron production workshops, and extensive research and conservation at the Apedemak Temple, one of the most important religious locations at the Royal City.
