Mogadishu At least 14 people were killed and several others wounded on Thursday when a car bomb blew up outside a popular hotel in the Somalia's capital Mogadishu. The Al-Qaeda aligned Shabaab group said it was responsible for the blast in front of the Weheliye hotel in the city centre, claiming it had targeted a gathering of government officials, army and intelligence officers. A government spokesman said 14 people had died but the toll could rise as rescuers search through the debris.
