A Graduation Day for the KG children of MES Indian School was organised recently.
In a glittering ceremony conducted in the KG Auditorium, a total of 50 Kindergarten graduates from both the divisions of KG II A & KG II B were felicitated with graduation certificates. The children's stay at the kindergarten was well recounted by young speaker, Master Midlaj Musthafa.
The 'graduates' thanked their teachers and parents for what they had achieved. KG II graduates were also given a fitting farewell speech by a tiny speaker from KG I A, Master Zachariah Samson. Gracing the function were General Secretary PK Mohammed, Governing Board Finance Director Ahmed Isham, Officiating Principal Annamma Shammy, KG Section Coordinator Rukhsana Mansoor, Heads of Sections, school officials, parents and teachers.
Earlier, Master Johan Jobsy of KG II B welcomed the gathering, while Amar Ramachandren of KG II A proposed the vote of thanks.
