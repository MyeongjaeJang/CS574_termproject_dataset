CHRISTCHURCH Captain Joe Root believes England have a better idea of the direction they are heading after their long tour Down Under came to a disappointing conclusion with the side failing to secure a victory in seven Tests against Australia and New Zealand.
"You want to play in big series and we've had the opportunity to do that this winter,"Root said in the on-pitch presentation ceremony at Hagley Oval after England fell two wickets short of victory.
"Unfortunately, it's not gone as well as we'd liked. But we have to pick ourselves up and make sure that when we come to the start of the summer, we're all switched on and we take the good stuff we've done this week into it."
