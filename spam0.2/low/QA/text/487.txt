Humanitarian needs caused by conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo have doubled over the past year, the UN Security Council has said.
The country has been at war for much of the past 25 years, including recent political instability after President Joseph Kabila stayed in power beyond his mandated two terms in office.
Now, as the United Nations plans to hold a donor conference in Switzerland to help raise nearly $2bn, Congo officials say they will not attend, accusing the agency of exaggerating the problem.
