THE Ministry of Interior's (MoI) Metrash2 application has won the Digital Access Certified Award from Qatar Assistive Technology Center (Mada) for adopting digital access for persons with disabilities.
Mada Center CEO Maha Mohammed al Mansouri presented the award to Brigadier Ibrahim al Haremi, director of Information Systems Department, General Information Systems Department, and Captain Ali al Binali, head of E-Services and Internet, at a ceremony held at Mada headquarters.
Brigadier Haremi expressed his appreciation for the award to Metrash2 in recognition of its compliance with the standards of electronic access to e-services it provides and facilities it offers to persons with disabilities.
"We believe in the right of people with disabilities to access all information, applications, e-services and digital content like others. We are keen to empower people with disabilities and older persons to integrate them fully into society," Mansouri said.
