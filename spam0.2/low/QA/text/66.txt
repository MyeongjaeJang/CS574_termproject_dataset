WITH a host of new smartphone device launches planned for 2018, Ooredoo is reminding customers that 'Flexi-Pay' is available on devices in Ooredoo shops.
To ensure that everyone can take advantage of the latest technology, Ooredoo launched a payment instalment programme (Flexi-Pay) that enables customers to purchase the latest devices and spread payments over a calendar year.
Customers who bank with QNB, Commercial Bank of Qatar or Doha Bank can enjoy the spread out payment options, and Flexi-Pay is available on all devices of a greater value than QR500.
Devices available from Ooredoo include the latest smartphones, tablets, Ooredoo 4G+ My-Fi connections and 4G Smart Cradles.
On top of the monthly instalments, customers will benefit from a 0% interest rate, so that they can manage their costs more effectively over the year. (TNN)
