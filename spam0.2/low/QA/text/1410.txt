The total dividends distributed by firms listed on Qatar Stock Exchange (QSE) for 2017 jumped 14 percent to QR22.1 billion from QR19.4 billion in the previous year.
According to a report released by QNB Financial Services (QNBFS) on Tuesday, the dividend season was lucrative for investors as 17 of the 45 companies listed on the QSE increased distributions by an average of 41 percent, while 19 companies left their dividend distribution levels unchanged from last year. Four companies reduced dividend distribution values by an average of 14 percent and the remaining five elected not to distribute any dividends.
Digging deeper into the data, QNBFS said, it noted that much of the overall QSE dividend increases were driven primarily by an increase in the cash dividend distribution.
"We note that significant dividend growth for 2017 has been seen within the banking space with an increase of 44 percent compared to 2016. It was led by QNB Group as it increased dividend distribution by 89 percent partially as a result of bonus shares issued in 2016. Insurance, industrial, and consumer goods and services sectors also experienced material increases in dividend payments by 20 percent, 12 percent and 10 percent respectively," the report said.
Other sectors, primarily in real estate and non-bank financial services, however, did not fare well.
In real estate, both Ezdan and Mazaya Qatar elected not to distribute any dividends due to weakness experienced in Qatari real estate, which was compounded by balance sheet challenges as a result of leverage.
For non-bank financial sector, Islamic Holding Group was the only company to eliminate dividends.
Looking into 2018, QNBFS said, it was optimistic that this dividend season coupled with a recovery in non-bank profitability would bolster Qatar's image as an attractive dividend yield market in the future.
