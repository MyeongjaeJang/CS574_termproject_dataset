NEW YORK/LONDON
A US resident has sued Facebook and a British-based political consultancy for obtaining data from millions of social media site’s users without their permission, while an academic at the centre of the storm accused both firms of scapegoating him.
The complaint filed at the US District Court in San Jose, California, marked the first of what may be many lawsuits seeking damages over Facebook’s ability to protect user data, and exploitation of information by Cambridge Analytica consultancy to help President Donald Trump’s election campaign.
Facebook has been rocked this week by a whistleblower who said Cambridge Analytica, which Trump hired for the 2016 campaign, improperly accessed information on Facebook users to build detailed profiles on American voters.
The proposed class-action complaint was filed by Lauren Price, a Maryland resident. “Every Facebook user has an interest in this lawsuit, and the enforcement of their privacy rights,” John Yanchunis, a lawyer for Price, told Reuters on Wednesday. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, including possible punitive damages.
Facebook and Cambridge Analytica did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment.
