THE new National Health Strategy 2018-2022 offers a unique model for health care in Qatar with more focus on disease prevention and helping the community maintain good health, health sector officials have said.
Assistant Secretary-General for Medical Affairs at the Ministry of Public Health Saleh bin Ali al Marri said new strategy will build on the successes and achievements of the first strategy, noting that the healthcare system in Qatar has made remarkable achievements in recent years.
Marri said the National Health Strategy 2018-2022 is one of eight government sector strategies under the umbrella of the National Development Strategy.
Director of Public Health Department at the Ministry of Public Health Dr Sheikh Mohammed al Thani said the new strategy is a continuation of what was achieved in the 2011-16 strategy, adding that it was basically an umbrella for all strategies launched in the health sector, including primary health and mental health strategies. He said the strategy focuses on ways to protect the population from disease as well as improve healthcare systems and services infrastructure.
Managing Director of PHCC Mariam Alabdulmalik said the corporation plays a pivotal role in implementing the National Health Strategy as the first line in the health system, providing specialised services in family medicine as well as early detection services for many diseases.
She added that the corporation focuses its attention on primary health care through strengthening the work on preventive actions, stressing that success in providing high-quality healthcare will be achieved by focusing on prevention before treatment under the provision of specialised and qualified cadres.
