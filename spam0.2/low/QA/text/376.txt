Washington US President Donald Trump has signed an order that paves the way for imposing tariffs on as much as $60bn worth of Chinese goods imports. The move on Thursday is seen as a direct shot in a brewing trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Saying it would be the"first of many"trade actions, Trump said the measure was aimed at punishing Beijing over the alleged theft of US technology and Chinese pressure on American companies to hand it over."We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on,"Trump told reporters.
