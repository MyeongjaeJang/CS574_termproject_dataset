The Agriculture Affairs Department at the Ministry of Municipality and Environment (MME) will open three more vegetable yards for selling local agricultural produce, poultry and meat.
The new vegetable yards will come up at Al Shahaniya, Al Sailiya and Al Ruwais in the last quarter of this year.
"The concept of 'Vegetable Yard' cropped up after the Ministry of Economy and Commerce (MEC) established a stable market network in a short period of time benefiting farmers and customers alike," Ahmed al Yafei, an official of the MME, told Qatar Tribune.
"The local production of vegetable has seen four-fold growth as the country witnessed massive expansion of cultivated area after a blockade was imposed on Doha. The increase in production needs a corresponding expansion of the marketing network. The new vegetable selling yards will help farmers sell their produce during the next harvest season," he added.
The first yard was opened in 2016 and the quantity of vegetables distributed through this network was about 25,000 kg, he said, adding that the market network then saw a steady growth.
"The total quantity distributed through the 'yard' in June 2017 was 45,000 kg. And it continued to grow further in the following months reaching 260,000 kg in February 2018," he added.
In the last two years, the number of farms has also gone up. Currently, more than 100 farms have benefited from the marketing network.
The expansion of agriculture has also given a boost to honey production. The total yield of natural honey in 2015 was around 3,000 kg. The honey production increased to more than 6,000 kg in 2017.
The existing annual winter markets run by the Agricultural Affairs Department are located at Al Mazrouah (Near Umm Salal), Al Khor-Dhakhira, Al Wakrah and Katara the Cultural Village Foundation.
