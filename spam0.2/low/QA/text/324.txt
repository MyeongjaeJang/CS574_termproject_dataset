Qatar Airways Celebrates Mothers’ Day with a Special Video Posted on Comments Qatar Airways recently created a special Mothers’ Day video, highlighting the role a mother plays in ensuring that her child’s journey through life is a safe one. The video, published on the airline’s social media channels on Mother’s Day, honours all mothers for the important part they play in ensuring the safety of their children. This inspiring new video, using the airline’s safety instructions as inspiration, depicts scenes of a child securely putting away toys in the toy box and switching off electronic devices before sleeping, illustrating the key role all mothers play in making sure their children’s environment is safe and secure. Qatar Airways Senior Vice President for Marketing and Corporate Communications, Salam Al Shawa, said that the Mothers’ Day video pays special tribute to the important role mothers play in the safety of their children. She said that as an airline, they welcome both parents and children on board, ensuring that their journey is both enjoyable and inspiring. Earlier this week, Qatar Airways launched an exciting new initiative for children, the Oryx Kids Club , a special frequent flyer programme designed for the airline’s youngest travellers. Oryx Kids Club gives children the opportunity to enjoy value-added benefits while travelling with Qatar Airways. For more information about Qatar Airways, visit their website at qatarairways.com .
