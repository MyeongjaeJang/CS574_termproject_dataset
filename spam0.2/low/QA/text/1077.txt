Los Angeles: Cleveland superstar LeBron James matched NBA icon Michael Jordan's record streak of 866 straight double-digit scoring games Wednesday in leading the Cavaliers to a 118-105 victory over the Charlotte Hornets.
James finished with 41 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists for the Cavs, who bounced back from a dismal defeat in Miami on Tuesday in which they scored just 79 points.
He hit double digits in the second quarter with an alley-oop dunk off a pass from JR Smith."Any time I'm in the same conversation with Mike and other great guys it lets me know I'm doing the right thing," said James, whose streak began on January 6, 2007. Jordan put together his streak from 1986-2001. It was a milestone night for Charlotte's Kemba Walker as well. With 21 points he surpassed Dell Curry (9,839 points) as the Hornets' all-time leading scorer.
James said such moments should be savored -- even in a losing effort. But he said records aren't what drive him.
"My motivation is love of the game," he said.
