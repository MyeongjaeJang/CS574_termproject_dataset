MORE than 20,000 enthusiastic spectators surrounded the lake in Aspire Park to watch a spectacular fireworks display of the 2nd Aspire Lake Festival 'Magical Journey'.
The event was organised by Aspire Zone Foundation (AZF), in partnership with Ooredoo, Qatar Airways, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy and Katara, and directed by French artist Christophe Berthonneau.
The spectators were taken by surprise with the performance's theatrics which turned the Aspire Lake into a 3D spectacle. The 40-minute performances were the ideal blend between two of the Earth's contrasting elements, water and fire. The fireworks displayed were perfectly timed to match the tone of music that accompanied the show.
Speaking about the festival, Kholoudal Hail, Chairperson of the event's Organising Committee, said:"The event transformed AZF from a host of international sporting events to one of the preferred entertainment destinations in Doha, catering to the growing interest of all community members and tourists in Qatar. AZF's logistical capabilities and comprehensive facilities bring Qatar a step closer to achieving its objectives of providing the ideal mixture of sports tourism and leisure activities for people."
Speaking about the show's enormous success, French fireworks art wizard Berthonneau said:"We display our art all around the world, but we only do original shows. We don't want to do the same show every time. So, when we came to Qatar, we didn't think we're doing a Qatari show, but that we're doing a show for Qatar." (TNN)
