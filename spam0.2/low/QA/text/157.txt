DETROIT: Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it will pause autonomous vehicle testing following an accident in which an Uber Technologies Inc self-driving vehicle struck and killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona.
Toyota said in a statement"the incident may have an emotional effect on our test drivers. This 'timeout' is meant to give them time to come to a sense of balance about the inherent risks of their jobs." Separately, the Maricopa County Attorney's Office in Phoenix said it was awaiting the results of an investigation by Tempe police of the fatality before reviewing whether any charges should be filed. Officials with the National Transportation Safety Board and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also are investigating the accident. (Reuters)
