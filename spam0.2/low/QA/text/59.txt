AFG College with the University of Aberdeen launched a new student initiative 'Entrepreneurs in Qatar' this week to provide a platform for young entrepreneurs and to help develop entrepreneurism networks.
The Student Advisory Body, made up of eight students, (Ahmad al Haider, Ali Abdulla, Abdulrahman al Theyab, Shk Abdulla al Thani, Shk Abdulaziz al Thani, Shk Ahmed al Thani, Ibrahim Almohssen and Ali al Mahsin) worked closely with the Director for Business Development, Linda-Jane Buckle, to map out their plans and objectives.
Linda-Jane Buckle said:"We identified that there is an opportunity on our campus to develop an entrepreneurial space for students to learn from the experience of young entrepreneurs. To understand from their successes and the lessons they have learnt through talks hosted by the student group 'Entrepreneurs in Qatar' on the campus."
Brian Buckley, Principal, said:"I believe this is an exciting development. This is student driven and provides our students with the opportunity to have frank conversations with entrepreneurial role models."
The first seminar was delivered by Abdulaziz al Emadi who focused on his experience as a young Qatari in building his business.
"I believe it is important to be a role model for entrepreneurs in Qatar. I was delighted to be a part of this seminar and be part of a frank discussion among the students. The event was very well attended and the students were enthusiastic," Emadi said.
'Entrepreneurs in Qatar' will be hosting monthly seminars at AFG College with the University of Aberdeen featuring local entrepreneurs. (TNN)
