BARCELONA
Barcelona should extend their"more than a club" motto to their ticket pricing, Rome-based newspaper Il Romanista said on Tuesday as they urged the La Liga side to lower rates for their Champions League quarter-final first leg against AS Roma.
The newspaper published a copy of an open letter it sent to Barca's president Josep Maria Bartomeu in which it railed against prices for visiting supporters for the game at the Nou Camp on April 4, which are expected to begin at 90 euros ($110.3)."If we continue like this, supporting a team will become an inaccessible luxury for a large number of supporters," said the letter, published in Italian and Catalan.
"Your club has always been unique in football for the class it has shown on and off the pitch. Show us one more time that you're more than a club. We have faith and hope that you will consider this petition."
