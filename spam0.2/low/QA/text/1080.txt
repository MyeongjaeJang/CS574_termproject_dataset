QATAR Charity (QC) has distributed emergency winter relief and food aid to more than 1,300 families with 4,500 people in 12 municipalities and villages of Bosnia and Herzegovina at a total cost of QR500,000.
The aid distributed in many places of the country, including some highland areas, came within the framework of the 'Affected By Winter'campaign aiming to alleviate the suffering of needy families.
The relief assistance has been provided through the QC's office in the country at the time of snowfall and when the temperatures sharply dropped to less than -15 degrees.
Faisal al Fahida, executive director of the QC's Executive Management of International Operations, said the beneficiary families in Bosnia and Herzegovina received food baskets containing flour, oil, sugar, macaroni, canned meat, salt and rice, as well as blankets and winter clothes.
More than 100 tonnes of wood for heating were distributed to poor families living in the highlands, which are hard-to-reach areas, particularly at this time of the year, owing to heavy snowfall, leading to the interruption of transport to and from these places, Fahida added.
The aid beneficiaries thanked the Qatari people for their humanitarian initiatives and their continued support to the Bosnian people in order to alleviate the suffering of those in need, affected and orphans during the winter.
Moreover, QC has already distributed winter clothes, blankets and food baskets to more than 400 orphans along with their families in Bosnia and Herzegovina within the framework of the QC's 'Orphan Below Zero'campaign.
For the second consecutive year, QC has carried out the same campaign to provide warmth and due care to its Syrian orphans in Lebanon and Turkey, as well as its orphans in Kyrgyzstan, Bosnia, Albania and Kosovo at a cost of QR3 million.
