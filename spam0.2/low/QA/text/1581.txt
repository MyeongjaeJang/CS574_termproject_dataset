French Embassy in Qatar Organises Blood Donation Campaign Posted on Comments French residents in Qatar recently participated in a blood donation campaign held at the residence of French Ambassador Eric Chevallier. The initiative was organised by the Embassy of France to the State of Qatar. French Ambassador Eric Chevallier, expressed his gratitude to all the donors for contributing to the Qatar National Organ and Blood Donation Campaign and expressed his appreciation for the active role of Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) as well as the francophone network association in Qatar, Doha Accueil . For the 4 th consecutive year, we have organised a campaign at the French Residence in cooperation with HMC and Doha Accueil. I donated my blood once again as I know how meaningful this small gesture can be. The French community representatives organised several campaigns as well in Lycée Bonaparte and Lycée Voltaire.’ Addressing the media, the French Ambassador stressed the importance of blood donation. Being engaged in your community and your country of residence, acting to save those in need, proves once again that the French community in Doha fulfils its civic responsibilities, and this will continue. In 2015, I promised to mobilise the French community and more broadly the francophone community living in Qatar. I kept my promise, with great support from the francophone network association, Doha Accueil , a member of Maison de la France.’ Chevallier also announced that the Doha Accueil network association was participating in the Akhlaquna Award , an initiative introduced by HH Sheikha Moza Bint Nasser, and carried out by Qatar Foundation.
