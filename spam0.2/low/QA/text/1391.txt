Bras'edlia A mild earthquake rippled through Brasilia on Monday but the real upheaval will come when the Supreme Court decides this week whether former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva should be imprisoned.
The slight tremor, linked to a distant quake in neighboring Bolivia, was nothing compared to the shake-up engulfing Brazil's top political echelons six months from the most unpredictable presidential election in generations. Lula, 72, leads in the polls but the leftist former two-term president is fighting desperately to avoid having to start serving a 12-year sentence for accepting a luxury apartment as a kickback from a big construction company.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will rule on his petition that he be allowed to remain free while he exhausts all available appeals -- a strategy that would likely keep him out of jail for the near future and maybe even let him get on the presidential ballot. (AFP)
