A double-double each from captain Mohamed Yousef Mohamed, Nicholas Simon West and Baden Jaxen handed the first title to Qatar Sports Club since the 2008-2009 season when they secured the Qatar Cup Basketball Championship on Saturday.
Qatar Sports Club were trailing by 17 points and their comeback chances looked more than bleak against defending champions Al Gharafa Club, featuring in the fifth final in a row.
Later when two and a half minutes left, they were still 11 points in arrear (82-93). However, Qatar Sports Club launched a thrilling recovery and tied the scores with Jaxen sinking both free throws seven seconds from the regular finish.
Then Jahmar Young missed out on a three-point chance and Nedim Muslic fouled on West with just one second remaining. He gladly put away the first gift to secure the win, though he could not convert the second out of excitement.
The match was a real cliff-hanger with the lead changing hands 19 times and both teams locked on six occasions.
This is the first time that since the 2008-09 season that former champions Qatar Sports Club reached any final.
With this victory, they won the title second time in six finals. From 2007 to 2009, the club had enjoyed a good time, reaching finals of the two major domestic championships the Emir Cup and Heir Apparent Cup (which is now called the Qatar Cup) but could not win any of them. They had beaten Al Rayyan Club in the 2001-02 final.
Mohamed Yousef Mohamed had a game-high 26 points alongwith 13 rebounds. West also had 25 points and 13 rebounds. Brandon Kearney added 19 pts, while Jaxen posted 15 points and 11 rebounds for the winners.
For Al Gharafa, who were playing the eighth final in this competition, Monroe led the scoring with 22, Abdulrahman Saad gained 17 points, Muslic got 14 points, including four three-pointers, while Omar Abdelkader Salem and Travis Franklin netted 13 each.
