Poongavanam-Qatar organised its first seed-sharing event at Ezdan Mall, Al Wakrah. The event was the brainchild of Noorul Firdhouse.
Group members shared the seeds of vegetables and fruits among themselves, which had been collected from fruits and vegetables growing in their houses. The idea came to the fore as most of them were looking for quality organic seeds for the next planting season in Qatar.
Poongavanam-Qatar wants to educate members and the community on how to become self sustainable by growing their own vegetables, in line with Qatar's National Vision to achieve self sufficiency in food.
