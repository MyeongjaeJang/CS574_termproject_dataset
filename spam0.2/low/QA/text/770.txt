Protection and Rehabilitation Center (Aman), which operates under the umbrella of Qatar Foundation for Social Work, has gifted safety watches to autistic students of Qatar Foundation member Renad Academy in cooperation with Vodafone Qatar on the occasion of World Autism Awareness, which is celebrated annually on April 2.
The safety watch allows the monitoring of child movement, making phone calls as well as other features that make it easy for parents to learn about the whereabouts of their children and protect them from getting lost in public areas.
An Aman team introduced parents to the watch and how to use it, especially as it facilitates the process of communication between children and their families as it supports SIM cards and is linked electronically to the mobile phone of the guardian, making it easier to communicate with them and track their movement electronically.
The watch also has other features for the child, including electronic games and a stimulating incentive system.
Aman has distributed over 4,000 watches for free to Shafallah Center children, a number of schoolchildren and Gulf children residing in Qatar as a gift from Aman on Gulf Child Day in January 2018.
