VIRGINIA Commonwealth University School of the Arts in Qatar (VCUarts Qatar) will be hosting a symposium on April 8, titled, 'Training Art Curators in the 21st Century'.
The symposium will bring together leading experts in art history, archaeology, curatorial studies and museum education to discuss innovations in bridging the academic and the practical when preparing a new generation of art curators. The symposium is free and open to the public and will take place from 8am to 4pm at VCUarts Qatar's Atrium.
Attendees and panelists at the event will debate and discuss subjects such as why art history matters, museum fellowships, becoming an art curator, engaging students with archaeological collections in museums and instructional design perspectives.
"Given its rapidly growing museum culture, Qatar's institutions require professionals with a general knowledge of art, in terms of both historical content and methods, as well as cutting-edge skills in museum practice," said Assistant Professor Radha Dalal from VCUarts Qatar's Art History program.
Speakers at the symposium, which is co-funded by Qatar National Research Fund and VCUarts Qatar, will include Dr Charlotte Klonk, Professor of Art History and New Media at Humboldt-Universit'e4tzu Berlin; Shaika Nasir al Nassr, Deputy Director of Curatorial Affairs at the Museum of Islamic Arts, Qatar Museums; Dr Margaret A.
