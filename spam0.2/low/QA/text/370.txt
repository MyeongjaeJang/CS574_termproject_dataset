The Bank of England said Thursday it had decided to keep its main interest rate at 0.50 percent, as it weighed high UK inflation against Brexit uncertainty.
"Our Monetary Policy Committee has voted by a majority of 7-2 to maintain Bank Rate at 0.50 percent,"said a statement following a regular meeting.
The MPC added that it was maintaining the amount of cash stimulus pumping around the UK economy at Â£445 billion ($630 billion, 512 billion euros).
While the Bank of England sat tight this time around, minutes of the meeting that ended Wednesday firmed up market expectations that the BoE will raise its key rate by a quarter-point at its next gathering in May.
The cental bank noted that"tightening of monetary policy... will be appropriate to return inflation"to its 2.0-percent target.
Regarding Brexit, the minutes said that"developments regarding the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union -- and in particular the reaction of households, businesses and asset prices to them remain the most significant influence on, and source of uncertainty about, the economic outlook".
Britain's annual inflation rate slowed to 2.7 percent in February as food and transport costs rose by less than one year ago, official data showed on Tuesday, but remains far above the target level.
In addition, official data this week showing that British wages growth is catching up with overall inflation has cemented expectations of an interest rate hike to 0.75 percent in May.
