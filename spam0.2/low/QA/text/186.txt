THE Cultural Village Foundation Katara organised a concert for Lebanese celebrity Cynthia Karam, in cooperation with the Embassy of Lebanon, as part of the Francophonie Week festivities.
The concert was attended by several diplomats including Lebanon's Ambassador to Qatar HE Hassan Najm who expressed his deepest gratitude to the organisers in Katara for holding the event.
Several people from different communities enjoyed the performance which was mainly in French, but included English and Arabic.
Cynthia expressed her happiness for joining this successful concert. It was her first time in Qatar. The Lebanese star, who contested in well-known Arab TV show 'Star Academy', later started her career in drama shows.
She pursued her acting career on TV and on stage, and today, she has become a noted celebrity in the region. (TNN)
