SHOWCASING its support for the development of Qatar's education sector, Doha Bank, one of the largest private commercial banks in Qatar, recently participated in the second annual Education Festival hosted by Al Faisal Without Borders Foundation (ALF).
Held at Qatar National Convention Centre from March 21 to 25, the five-day event, organised in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, saw Doha Bank as the only banking sector exhibitor actively supporting the festival's innovations and creativity.
Scott Kind, Head of Learning and Development at Doha Bank, said:"ALF's Education Festival provides a unique hands-on opportunity for us to support the country's commitment to investing in its human capital as part of the Qatar National Vision 2030 objectives, while also enabling us to reach out to a wider segment of the society and raise more awareness about our products, services and highlight career opportunities in the banking sector."
Career growth and equal opportunities are top priorities at Doha Bank as part of the overarching objectives of its various educational, training and development programmes that are aligned firmly with Qatar National Vision 2030 and ALF's mission, which focuses on preparing young adults to become future leaders of Qatari society.
