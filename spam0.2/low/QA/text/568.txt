India chief coach Stephen Constantine on Saturday announced the list of 24 playersfor the forthcoming AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Kyrgyzstan in Bishkek on Tuesday. India presently top Group A with 13 points, having already qualified for the Asian Cup in the UAE next year. However, Constantine aims to continue the good work.
"We always play to win. We have, however, a number of players who are out for the match. Sunil Chhetri is serving a double yellow booking, Eugeneson Lyngdoh is injured and so are Jackichand Singh and Nikhil Poojary," he said.
This is India's second qualification in 8 years, with the team having qualified last time in 2011.
"I think it has been huge and when you look at the manner we qualified this time around, it has been very difficult. We played the playoffs for the World Cup qualifiers, the group stages for the WC Qualifiers, the playoffs for the Asian Cup qualifiers and the group stages again.
"The last time we qualified was in an 8-nation competition in India and so it doesn't compare." he said.
He is expecting a tough contest against Kyrgyzstan."They are a very good side and we can expect a similar game as we had against them in Bengaluru. They have good quality all over the field but so do we.
"They also have the home advantage this time around. We have already qualified and will have to be very careful to maintain our focus and try to get the three points."
