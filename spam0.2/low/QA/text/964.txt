THE United Nations (UN) Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has expressed gratitude to the State of Qatar for donating $50 million to the agency during the ministerial meeting to support UNRWA, which was held in Rome on March 15.
Speaking at a press conference in Gaza on Wednesday, UNRWA Commissioner General Pierre Krahenbuhl thanked Qatar for the generous donation and called on other world countries to follow the steps of Doha in donating to the organisation to support its services for more than five million Palestinian refugees.
On Friday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his thanks and gratitude to the Emir HH Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani for the State of Qatar's pledge to donate $50 million to UNRWA.
