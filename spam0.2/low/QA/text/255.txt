Turkey's economy is in the midst of a strong upturn due to a $60 billion government backed credit guarantee fund (CGF), fiscal stimulus and robust external demand, according to Qatar National Bank's (QNB) Turkey Economic Insight 2017 report published recently.
The report examines recent developments and the outlook for the Turkish economy.
Turkey's real GDP growth was estimated at 6.8 percent in 2017 and is projected to moderate thereafter to 5.4 percent in 2018 and 5.3 percent in 2019 as some stimulus measures are partly scaled back. The country's inflation rose to 11.9 percent at end-2017 reflecting oil price gains, a weaker lira (TRY) and strong domestic demand due to stimulus measures, the report noted.
Inflation would gradually ease to 8.5 percent by end-2019 as the lira declines by less than it did in 2017, the report said.
"We project the current account deficit to widen slightly from 5.6 percent of GDP in 2017 to 5.9 percent in 2018 and 2019 as import growth is expected to outpace exports due to strong domestic demand and higher oil prices.
"As a result we expect the lira to weaken as well, declining from an average of 3.6 per US dollar in 2017 to 3.8 and 4 in 2018 and 2019," the QNB report noted.
Banking sector growth is expected to remain robust on the back of the high lending growth as a result of the CGF, the report said.
"Asset quality will continue to improve with non-performing loans expected to decline from 2.9 percent in 2017 to 2.8 percent by 2019.
"Profitability and capitalisation are expected to remain strong, the former reached a four-year high in 2017, with return on equity over 20 percent and the capital adequacy ratio rose to over 16 percent in 2017," the report concluded.
