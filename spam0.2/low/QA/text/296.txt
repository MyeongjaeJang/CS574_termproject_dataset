REPRESENTATIVES from the World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE), an initiative of Qatar Foundation (QF), recently met with Alan Greenberg, Director of Wideacademy and former head of Education at Apple, during his visit to Qatar.
During his time working for Apple, Greenberg was responsible for the deployment of a number of flagship projects, including iTunes University and iTunes Podcast.
As an early proponent of podcasts, Greenberg sees the spoken word as having as much relevance today as ever before:"In education terms, I think [podcasts] are underrated."
In line with the belief that knowledge sharing can help produce better outcomes, WISE has released its own podcast series, 'WISE Words' that facilitates in-depth discussions about the latest developments in global education.
Greenberg's visit included a tour of Education City, taking in the College of Islamic Studies, Education City Mosque and QF headquarters.
Wideacademy is an education and thought leadership platform connecting innovators, practitioners and audiences in the stem cell and life science industries.
Greenberg also met with officials from the World Innovation Summit for Health as part of his visit. (TNN)
