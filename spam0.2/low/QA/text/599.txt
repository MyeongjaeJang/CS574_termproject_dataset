Hatim (58) and Akram Afif (72) struck Qatar's goals against Syria to split points on Saturday. Qatar, who beat Iraq 3-2 on the opening day, hit back after Syria were given the lead by Omar al Somah in the 49th minute. Zaher Midani scored the second goal for Syria in the second half. "It was a great match. It was a fighting performance from our side. We showed patience and attacked well," Hatem said after the match. "The players never gave up and we scored two goals in the second half. We even took the lead and could have won. We played a great first match also. These performances give us confidence," he added. Hatem, 27, dismissed the constant arguments among the players during the feisty battle. "It happens. It was all good fun," Hatim said. Syria's Midani said:"It was a great football match. Qatar also played really well. Our target was not to lose this match. I would say my players really fought well." Hosts Iraq are the third team in the tournament which is being played to celebrate the return of football on the home soil after more than three decades. Â© Copyright Qatar Tribune.
