SOUQ Waqif administration has directed restaurants and cafes which serve 'shisha' to increase its price to a minimum of QR50 in a bid to combat smoking and discourage smokers.
"The decision was taken a couple of days ago and aims to make the Souq more family-friendly," Souq Waqif's General Manager Mohammed al Salem told Qatar Tribune.
He pointed out that it has been observed that the cafes are normally packed with shisha smokers, which prevents families from visiting the Souq along with children.
"Earlier, we allowed shisha at the Souq to satisfy tourists, but we realised that it has become the dominant reason for people to go there," he continued.
Salem said that the decision will help create space for families who do not wish to see smokers around while at the same time allowing shisha lovers to enjoy their habit.
He, however, dismissed reports on social media regarding rise in food prices at restaurants as"totally false".
However, a café supervisor at Souq Waqif told Qatar Tribune that this decision has significantly decreased their daily customers."The prices have doubled from QR25 to QR50. So, most of our daily customers who came only to have shisha at the café have stopped coming," he said.
He also pointed out that they used to receive many families in the presence of shisha smokers, but hardly a complaint was raised by them, noting that they sell more snacks and beverages than shisha.
Mohammed Abu Khadija, a regular visitor to the Souq and also a shisha smoker said that he welcomes the decision as it has provided him more space to enjoy in tranquility.
