President Donald Trump rejected on Wednesday a former US Supreme Court judge's call for the repeal of the Second Amendment to the US Constitution, which guarantees the right to bear arms.
"THE SECOND AMENDMENT WILL NEVER BE REPEALED!,"Trump wrote in a tweet in response to the appeal by former justice John Paul Stevens.
"As much as Democrats would like to see this happen, and despite the words yesterday of former Supreme Court Justice Stevens, NO WAY. We need more Republicans in 2018 and must ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court!,"Trump added.
Stevens made the call on Tuesday in an op-ed in The New York Times three days after the 'March for Our Lives', a series of nationwide protests that were the largest in support of gun control for nearly two decades and came in response to the Valentine's Day school shooting in Parkland, Florida that left 17 students and staffers dead.
"Rarely in my lifetime have I seen the type of civic engagement school children and their supporters demonstrated in Washington and other major cities throughout the country this past Saturday,"wrote the former high court judge, now aged 97.
Stephens, who was nominated to the Supreme Court by Republican president Gerald Ford in 1975, said the protests"reveal the broad public support for legislation to minimise the risk of mass killings of school children and others."
But he said activists, who are calling for a ban on assault rifles and raising the legal age to buy a firearm to 21, should go further in their demands.
