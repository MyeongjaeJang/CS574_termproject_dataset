French star Martin Fourcade clinched a fourth biathlon World Cup title of the season on Saturday with first place in a pursuit race in Russia and can complete a sweep of all trophies in Sunday's season finale.
The Frenchman Fourcade coasted to victory over 12.5 kilometres in Tyumen in 32 minutes 9.7 seconds although he missed the last of 20 targets in the shooting range.
Norway's Johannes Thingnes Boew trailed by 47.9 seconds in second place, and Italy's Lukas Hofer was third with a deficit of 1:08.4 minutes.
The three-time Pyeongchang Olympic Games champion Fourcade added the pursuit World Cup title title to a record seventh overall, as well as those in the sprint and individual (shared with Boe), with his ninth season win and 70th overall.
Fourcade can complete a sweep of all crystal globes in Sunday's mass start race as he also has a big lead over Boe in that discipline.
A women's pursuit was scheduled for later Saturday in Tyumen, with the overall World Cup title race still a three-women affair between Slovakia's Anastasiya Kuzmina, Kaisa Makarainen of Finland and Darya Domracheva of Belarus.
