THE Ministry of Education and Higher Education has established the first database for students with special needs in local schools, in line with the government's directives towards digital transformation in the ministries of the State.
The measure also aims to achieve the vision and mission of the ministry in the implementation of a system of integrated educational services for all students in accordance with QNV 2030.
"The work on the database took two years and the process included reviewing its data, testing and modifying it, and training the staff, coordinators and officials from local schools. The database aims primarily at providing a comprehensive database of students with special needs in general education schools, their individual educational plan and the services provided to them," said director of the Department of Special Education at the Ministry Hanadi Mansour al Khater.
The official also reviewed the advantages offered by the system, notably the registration of new students electronically through Roaa Center, the management and organisation of the comprehensive electronic evaluation process and the identification of students with special needs in the national system of student information.
She pointed out that additional services will be added in the second phase of the programme to include private school students.
"The ministry's efforts on digital transformation are witnessing rapid progress. Most of the transactions are now provided electronically on the ministry's e-system enabling the public to carry out transactions easily," Khater said. (TNN)
