Nairobi: Kenya's Joyce Chepkirui has opted not to defend her 10,000m gold medal at the Commonwealth Games (CWG) and instead will be running in the Istanbul Half Marathon on April 8. Chepkirui, 30, like many elite runners from Kenya, has shunned the Club Games, which are only limited to athletes from countries formally colonised by Britain, and will take her assignment in Turkey.
