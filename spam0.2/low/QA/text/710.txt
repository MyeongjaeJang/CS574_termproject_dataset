Qatar will carry out a $4 billion project for the rehabilitation and management of the Suakin Port in east Sudanese state of Red Sea, its Minister of Transport, Roads and Bridges Makkawi Mohammed Awad has said.
In remarks following a meeting with Qatar's Minister of Transport and Communications HE Jassim bin Saif al Sulaiti, who is currently visiting Khartoum, the Sudanese minister said Qatar and Sudan have agreed to a new partnership for the Suakin project.
The two countries were set to sign the agreement on Monday on implementing the project, which is expected to be completed in 2020 with Qatari funding worth $4 billion.
Out of this amount, $500 million will be allocated for implementing the first phase of the project. Awad said Sudan's share of the project will be 51 percent, while that of Qatari will be 49 percent.
The Sudanese minister pointed out that the project would revive Suakin's historic vital economic role as a gateway to Africa.
Sulaiti said his current visit to Sudan aims to discuss opportunities for cooperation and joint investment between the two countries.
"Suakin Port has many advantages as it significantly supports exports and, being located along the Silk Road, its enjoys special strategic importance. It is an important meeting point for exports, especially for the neighbouring countries of Sudan."
Red Sea Governor Ali Ahmed Hamid promised his administration's full support for the Qatari investment projects that he said would strengthen the local as well as the national economy.
"We welcome Qatari investments and expect them to have a significant economic impact," he added.
