US President Donald Trump on Saturday resumed his attacks against online retailing giant Amazon and accused The Washington Post, owned by Amazon's founder Jeff Bezos, of lobbying for the company.
His latest comments coincided with a report in Saturday's Post about three different legal efforts"trying to pry open" the books of the president's umbrella company, the Trump Organisation.
On Twitter, Trump claimed the US Postal Service loses"billions of dollars" delivering packages for Amazon.
"This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!", he wrote.
