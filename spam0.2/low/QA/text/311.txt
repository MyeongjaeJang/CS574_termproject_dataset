Australian racer Daniel Ricciardo says he expects Mercedes, Ferrari and his Red Bull team to be within half a second of each other at the season-opening Formula One Australian Grand Prix.
Ricciardo is hoping for a first podium finish on home soil in~Melbourne on Sunday and believes it could be tight at the top between the three teams.
"If I'm just talking top three, I'd love to say we are all within half a second," Ricciardo told the Formula One website in a post on Wednesday.
"I think that's still being quite conservative but realistically, if it leaves six cars within half a second, it's looking all right. I'd like to think that's as big as the gap is going to be spread.
"I don't know where we stand with Ferrari. I think we are close. I couldn't tell you if we are a tenth quicker or they are."
Ricciardo, who is again partnered by Max Verstappen, said Red Bull were heading into the Melbourne race"a lot more prepared than we have been in previous years."
Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff has already predicted a three-way battle for the Formula One crown in a record-breaking 21-race season.
World champion Lewis Hamilton is hoping for a fifth title and his fourth for Mercedes, with Ferrari's four-time champion Sebastian Vettel in a Ferrari expected again to be his biggest rival.
"Last year, the competition was very close and there was no moment where we could afford to relax," Wolff said on the F1 website.
"Ferrari put up a very tough fight and we had a proper battle between silver and red. This year promises to bring an exciting three-way fight between us, Ferrari and Red Bull."
