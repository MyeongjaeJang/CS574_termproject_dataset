A dust storm is likely to hit the country late on Friday night and may continue until Tuesday, Qatar Meteorological Department (QMD) has predicted.
In statement, the QMD said the country will be affected by active north-west winds, accompanied by a dusty wave coming from the north of the Arabian Peninsula.
It also warned of visibility reduced to less than 1 km in some areas, especially on Saturday and Sunday.
The temperatures will be down as a result of the influence of the northern winds, it said.
The QMD has called on citizens and residents to keep windows and doors tightly closed.
"In view of the expected impact of the dust wave on the country at the dawn of Saturday, windows and doors should be kept closed," the QMD said on its official Twitter account.
The QMD has urged the public to avoid going to the sea and follow the latest updates through its official accounts.
