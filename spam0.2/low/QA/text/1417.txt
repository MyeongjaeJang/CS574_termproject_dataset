Qatar Financial Centre (QFC) Authority CEO Yousuf Mohamed al Jaida lauded Amwal LLC, a QFC listed firm, for listing and managing of one of the largest exchange-traded funds (ETF) in the GCC region.
Being traded under the symbol, QETF, on the Qatar Stock Exchange (QSE), the Amwal-managed ETF is the first-of-its-kind in Qatar that will measure price performance of the top 20 largest and most liquid companies on the Qatari bourse. Established by Doha Bank and managed by Amwal, QETF surpassed the size of any other ETF in the GCC with an initial open-ended capital of QR150 million at the time of its launch.
Announcing an update on the QFC's five-year roadmap, which was launched a year ago in April, Jaida said,"One of the key points in our strategy was to increase growth in assets for QFC firms, and we are doing just that."
He added:"Back in 2016, we announced that Qatar First Bank ” a QFC firm ” was the first Qatari entity to be listed on the Qatar Stock Exchange (QSE). I am very proud to add that Amwal LLC ” also a QFC firm ” has succeeded in the listing and the management of not just Qatar's first ETF, but also the largest in the GCC region." He said the achievement proves that QFC not only continues to attract the best in class businesses to its platform, but also paves the way for its firms to raise capital.
"As Qatar's growth continues, we are expecting the ETF market to further expand, with added opportunity for more of our firms to take part in trading," he concluded.
