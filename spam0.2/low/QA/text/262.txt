The Qatar Stock Exchange is expected to list two more ETFs this year, a senior official of the exchange has said.
QSE Product and Market Development Director Mohsin Mujtaba told Qatar Tribune that the two ETFs are expected to be launched by the same entities that have already launched two ETFs on the exchange. While one of the ETFs will track precious commodities, he said, the other one would track global Islamic equities.
