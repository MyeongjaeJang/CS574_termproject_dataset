Melbourne David Warner wasn't in the best headspace during the controversy-marred South Africa series, revealed his wife Candice Warner, who said that the couple had been severely affected by the constant taunts from the South Africa crowd about the Sonny Bill Williams incident.
The beleaguered vice-captain was banned for 12 months following the ball-tampering row, with Cricket Australia's investigations establishing that he was the mastermind behind the act that shook Australian cricket. Speaking to Daily Telegraph in the wake of Warner's press conference on Saturday (March 31) which ended with a lot of unanswered questions, Candice said the batsman was"an emotional wreck"while addressing the media.
"I feel like it's all my fault and it's killing me - it's absolutely killing me,"Candice said."He's just such an emotional wreck and I think he was sitting there hearing words but not really being able to process. If people could understand - which they probably won't because there's so many people out there that want answers - but if they could just sympathise just slightly with the month that he's had. I'm sure there were things he wanted to say but he just couldn't get it out. He is hurting. He is seriously, seriously struggling and he's not in a great headspace."
It has also been reported that Warner resorted to drinking and removed himself from the Australian team's WhatsApp group when the tampering saga came to light, with his team-mates apparently deserting him. Commenting on that, Candice said:"I think that's what's been really hurtful. There's been all these reports that we're such a divisive couple, that we divide the team and things like that. But we've hosted numerous barbecues at our home, not just for the players but their partners, support staff, and we did that a couple of times. He's always going to dinner with the boys when his family's not around."
