A young reformer or an entrenched military man? Ethiopia's prime minister-elect is the first from the Oromo ethnic group that's been at the forefront of anti-government protests.
Community activists say the group has been marginalised and excluded from political and economic power.
Ahmed has a doctorate in peace and security, as well as long-standing military and intelligence ties.

Can he unite a country riven by ethnic tensions?
