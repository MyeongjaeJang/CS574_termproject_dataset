As the unjust siege of Qatar by some of its neighbours entered the 300th day, Arabic hashtag '300 days of Qatar's blockade' began trending on Twitter and other social media platforms.
While the hashtag sparked a Twitter storm featuring tweets that hailed the Emir HH Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani and highlighted how the Saudi-led bloc's evil designs fizzled to make any impact, it soon had a cascading effect on other social media platforms. A programme hosted by Qatar TV under the same theme,"300 days of Qatar's blockade", on Saturday evening seems to have acted as the trigger for the hashtag. And there has been an overwhelming response ever since.
The show featured a panel of experts discussing the crisis and analysing Qatar's status as it nears a year under the blockade.
One of the panellists Dr Mohamed al Mesfer, Professor of Political Science at Qatar University, said,"The GCC crisis is baseless and rootless given its incorrect motives. The blockading countries' list of demands was made to be rejected, and the international community has discarded the siege countries' allegations that Qatar supports terrorism."
Dr Mesfer added that the ongoing GCC crisis is the region's worst event in recent history.
Another panellist, Dr Khaled Chams, Dean of the College of Business Administration at Qatar University, said:"On the economic level, we defeated the blockade. Thanks to the guidance of HH the Emir, Qatar's economy has registered growth during the last 300 days despite the blockade."
