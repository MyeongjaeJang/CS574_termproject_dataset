QATAR Tourism Authority (QTA) has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Kuwaiti Ministry of Information Tourism Sector, aiming to reinforce cooperation between the two countries in tourism development.
The agreement was signed by Hassan al Ibrahim, acting chairman of QTA, and on behalf of the Kuwaiti government, Jassim al Habib, tourism sector undersecretary. The signing event took place at the tourism sector headquarters in Kuwait City.
The agreement paves the way for long-term collaboration between Qatar and Kuwait through the sharing of knowledge and expertise in relation to tourism planning and development, in addition to joint promotion of the two destinations through shared marketing material.
Each side will also be inviting citizens and residents to enjoy vacations and organise trips to the other. Joint familiarisation trips to each of the destinations will also be organised for media and travel trade.
In addition, Qatari and Kuwaiti officials will be working together to attract investments into the tourism sector which benefit both sides.
"The signing of this new agreement comes amid strengthening ties between Qatar and Kuwait, and is a natural next step following many years of efforts to energise joint tourism," said Ibrahim."Kuwait holds a special place in the hearts of the people of Qatar, and we are greatly looking forward to the positive impact each of our nations will see following the implementation of this agreement."
