Patients Can Now Access Medical Records Online Posted on Comments 
Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) and Primary Health Centre Corporation (PHCC) can now access their personal health record online and through a mobile app. The patient portal MyHealth shows a single record of information irrespective of where the consultation was made – HMC or PHCC. 
Features of the portal include the ability to access lab reports, to view and reschedule upcoming appointments, and to review discharge summaries. The portal also allows patients to send a non-urgent message to their healthcare provider in a confidential manner. The nationwide launch of the programme follows a successful pilot conducted at HMC and PHCC. Currently, patients can enroll for MyHealth Portal online at myhealth.qa or at any HMC or PHCC facility. 
When applying online, patients can fill the details in the online form and submit for review. The application will be reviewed by HMC/PHCC and once approved an email invitation will be sent with link to access the MyHealth account. If the application is rejected, an email with reasons for rejection and suggested actions will be sent. 
All patients under 18 year of age should be registered under their parent’s MyHealth account. 
Patients can also seek more information about MyHealth by calling Nesma’ak at HMC on 16060 or Hayyak at PHCC on 107.
