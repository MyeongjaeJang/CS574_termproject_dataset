England manager Gareth Southgate said on Monday the door was still open to anyone to force their way into his plans for this summer's World Cup finals.
England play Italy at Wembley on Tuesday in a friendly international, with Southgate set to shuffle his pack again after Friday's 1-0 win over The Netherlands in Amsterdam.
"I don't think its too late for anybody," Southgate told a press conference.
"We'll still be monitoring everybody between now and the end of the season, none of us know what is going to happen over the next 8-10 weeks."
Jack Butland will start in goal for England after Jordan Pickford played against The Netherlands but Southgate said the other 10 spots are up for grabs.
"Other than that I have got to think through one or two things tonight," Southgate said.~"It's important we have competition for places.
"We'll make some changes but some we have brought in to have a look at for the first time, we are not just looking at the summer but beyond that as well.
"There are so many different things you are looking to get from the games, on Friday we managed to achieve pretty much all of those things and it would be great if we could do that again tomorrow."
Southgate said he expected a stern test from Italy, even if their opponents failed to qualify for the World Cup in Russia which kicks off June 14.
"I don't think they are in such a state as some people, they are a proud footballing nation, they won't come to Wembley and roll over," he said.
"They've got good players, the coach always organises his teams well, their attention to detail is always good and they will press us with more intensity than the other night."
