The Qatar Chamber (QC) on Thursday met with a labour delegation from Senegal to discuss cooperation on attracting trained labour from that country.
The meeting comes as part of the efforts of the joint Qatar-Senegalese committee, which aims to develop relations between the two countries in various fields.
QC Vice Chairman Mohammed bin Ahmed bin Tawar al Kuwari said Qatar was witnessing a leap in several fields, such as construction and tourism and is seeking to recruit skilled labour to help in the country's development.
Qatar's Senegalese community is contributing to that effort and is seen as efficient by employers, Kuwari added.
Qatar, the QC Vice Chairman said, spared no efforts in protecting the rights of workers.
