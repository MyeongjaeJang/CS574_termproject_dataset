In the spirit of giving back and in support of communities across the GCC, McDonald's Qatar is partnering Qatar Red Crescent to raise funds through sales of its flagship sandwich, the Big Mac. As part of its 'Big Mac, Big Cause' campaign, McDonald's donated 50 percent of profits from Big Mac sales on March 21 to Qatar Red Crescent, encouraging customers to satisfy their Big Mac craving while supporting a charitable cause.
McDonald's GCC offers three variations of the Big Mac, in celebration of the sandwich's 50th anniversary, and sales from all three sandwiches will contribute to the donations made to charities during the campaign. The Big Mac has been a signature menu item at McDonald's for half a century, with variations of the sandwich sold at restaurants on six continents.
"The Big Mac is one of the most recognisable items on our menu. It's a McDonald's staple, with a special sauce and an indescribable taste that's famous all around the world," said McDonald's Qatar General Manager Mithqual Afeef Abu-Nasser."The Big Mac is in our DNA so it seems natural to weave it into the core values that make us who we are. With the 'Big Mac, Big Cause' campaign, we brought people together with two things everyone can get behind: a delicious sandwich, and a good cause. The campaign reflected our continued commitment to both our customers and our communities."
The 'Big Mac, Big Cause' campaign aligns with the company's core value of giving back to its communities. By leveraging its size, global reach, and franchise model, McDonald's strives to make a positive impact and address the needs of the communities it serves. With the funds raised from Big Mac sales during the campaign, McDonald's continued to support, strengthen, and empower communities across the region.
