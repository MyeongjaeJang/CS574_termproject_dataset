JOHANNESBURG Australia bowling coach David Saker admits some players are struggling to free their minds of the ball-tampering scandal as they slip towards a heavy defeat in the fourth test and a first series loss to South Africa in almost 50 years.
Australia crumbled to 110 for six in their first innings at the close of day two at the Wanderers on Saturday, a long way off South Africa's imposing total of 488.
"We have tried to really care for each other this week. We are trying to put in a performance that the Australian nation and our group are proud of,"Saker told reporters.
"So far that hasn't happened, but the effort has been there and there is no doubt in the dressing-room the guys are trying their hardest. It just hasn't worked this game so far."
"We are not thinking too much about home, but we are thinking about the people that are part of our team that we have lost and that is hurting a lot of people in the dressing-room,"Saker said.
