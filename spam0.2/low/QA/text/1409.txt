Washington Facebook will likely need"a few years"to fix the problems uncovered by the revelations on the hijacking of private user data, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said in an interview released Monday. Speaking to the news site Vox, Zuckerberg defended the company's business model and shot back at criticism of the social networking giant from Apple CEO Tim Cook last week. Zuckerberg maintained that one of Facebook's problems was that it was"idealistic,"focusing on the positive aspects of connecting people and that"we didn't spend enough time investing in, or thinking through, some of the downside uses of the tools.""I think now people are appropriately focused on some of the risks and downsides as well,"he said."I think we will dig through this hole, but it will take a few years. I just think the reality is that solving some of these questions is just going to take a longer period of time."(AFP)
