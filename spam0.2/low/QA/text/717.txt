Between March 18 and March 22, Stafford Sri Lankan School Doha (SSLSD) conducted its Academic Week with numerous exciting learning activities in all subjects. The most exciting items of the week were the dramas, debates and model exhibitions appraised both by the teachers and the students. These activities were conducted for all grades ranging from Grades 1 to 10.
Concluding the Academic Week 2018, an exhibition was organised on March 22 by the Math and Science Departments of SSLSD. The programme commenced with the 'Research Forum 2018', which included a presentation by the upper school students on 'How to eat a rainbow diet?". The presentation focused on Oral Vitamin C Therapy on blood cholesterol level. Thereafter, the Grade 10 students performed an 'Element Dance Party' followed by another presentation by the upper school students on 'Stress related to age and gender'. The final presentation was the end result of a primary research work conducted by Dr Pushpa Gunawardana, blending practice with curriculum knowledge.
The Maths Department of the school had various exhibits of students from Grades 1 to 7. Adding to the excitement, a treasure hunt and a math race was conducted by students of Grades 8 to 10. Along with maths and Science Departments, the humanities department also had several exhibits highlighting the social structures and historical perspectives.
Proving that 'magic is just science that we don't understand yet,' an amazing scientific illusion was conducted in the school auditorium. This was one of the most intriguing sessions which seized the attention of spectators, as it displayed an act of heads talking without the bodies.
Extending its gratitude towards the students, teachers, parents and all staff members who contributed towards the success of this event, the school will be providing further opportunities for such exhibitions and innovative ideas to be brought out.
