QATAR and Jordan signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on boosting transport rights between the two countries, with the MoU allowing Qatar Airways (QA) to increase its passenger flights between Doha and Amman to 12 per week and the cargo flights to seven.
The signing came following a round of talks between Qatar's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and Jordan's Civil Aviation Regulatory Commission (CARC) on enhancing air transport between the two countries and means of boosting mutual cooperation in the field of civil aviation and airports.
Qatar's delegation was led by CAA Chairman Abdulla bin Nasser Turki al Subaey while CARC Chief Commissioner Haitham Misto chaired the Jordanian side.
The two sides also agreed on the importance of upgrading the air services agreement that they signed in 1976. The MoU is effective starting Monday.
