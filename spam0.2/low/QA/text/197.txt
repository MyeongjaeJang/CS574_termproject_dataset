Primary Health Care Corporation Qatar (PHCC) participated in (World Organization of National Colleges, Academies and Academic Associations of General Practitioners/Family Physicians, Eastern Mediterranean (WONCA) EMR's fifth international family medicine conference in Kuwait recently.
This year's WONCA EMR brought together regional health experts to share ideas, developments that will encourage fostering and maintaining high standards of care in general practice/family medicine.
Dr Samya Ahmad al Abdulla, senior consultant Family Physician and executive director for Operations at PHCC Qatar, presented an overview to WONCA EMR delegates of Qatar's ground-breaking SMART Health Check programme for population health management.
Dr Samya highlighted that the purpose of structured population health management is to engage the population with their health as an ongoing topic, and screen the population so as to initiate personalised treatment and maintenance measures which will help reduce the burden and cost of disease on the health system.
"The primary objective of the SMART Health Check is to act as a gateway into the full range of primary health care services," Dr Samya said."It supports the population of Qatar to take steps to maintain or improve their health. The PHCC programme can improve health outcomes for the community, encourage coordination of care between providers and allow integration of care with other locally relevant strategic priorities."
PHCC's 2016 pilot programme informed the design and implementation of an enhanced comprehensive health check, looking at individuals holistically to provide a personalised care plan to improve and maintain health. For the pilot, 4,494 people underwent SMART health check between January 2017 and January 2018.
