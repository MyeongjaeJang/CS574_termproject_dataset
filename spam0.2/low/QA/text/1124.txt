New York: Tesla is recalling 123,000 of its best-selling Model~S vehicles due to problems with its power-steering mechanism, the electric vehicle manufacturer told customers in an email Thursday. The voluntary recall - the widest yet by billionaire Elon Musk's company - affects models of the luxury sedan built before April 2016. Tesla determined that in colder climates, power-steering bolts could corrode excessively, making steering more difficult. There were no risks to safety and customers could continue to drive their cars, Tesla said. (DPA)
