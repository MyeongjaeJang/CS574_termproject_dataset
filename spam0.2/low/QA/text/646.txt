Al Khor Park on Saturday witnessed the release of the parrot Qarino in the presence of Dr Saif Ali al Hajri, head of the programme for A Flower for Each Spring, Shaheen Ghanem al Mohannadi, administrative director of Al Khor Park, and a number of school students. The celebration of the release of the parrot came after a year spent by the parrot at the corner of the Friends of the Environment programme at Ezdan Mall after it was found and treated in order to raise awareness about how to deal with the birds.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Municipality and Environment, represented by the Beaches and Islands Section of the Department of Hygiene, carried out a campaign to clean the island of Safliyah, where half a tonne of miscellaneous waste such as cans, empty plastic bags and wood were removed and disposed of in waste disposal areas.
