Texas A&M University at Qatar students and a dozen students from the main campus in the United States are currently participating in the annual Student Leadership Exchange Program, which focuses on leadership development across differences in culture, leadership styles and beliefs through group sessions and activities. The Qatar students visited the main campus recently to interact with fellow Aggies and learn firsthand about Aggie values and traditions. The jam-packed week in Texas included attending a basketball game, meeting Texas A&M's mascot, Reveille and visiting Kyle Field, Texas A&M's American football stadium that seats 102,733 people. Now, the Qatar students are hosting their College Station counterparts for a similar week of leadership development, cultural exploration, learning and engagement, all while showcasing Education City and Qatar.
