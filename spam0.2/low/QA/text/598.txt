the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) organised a Green Energy Solution Day Seminar in Doha recently under the patronage of the Qatari Businessmen Association (QBA) in association with Al Sawari Holding,
Those present at the event included Sheikh Faisal bin Qassim al Thani, Chairman of Qatari Businessmen Association and Al Faisal Holding, Sheikh Turki bin Faisal, Chairman al Sawari Holding, Mohammed Shafiek, Managing Director of Al Sawari Holding and Dr Suo-Hang, Chuang, Vice Chairman Taiwan External Trade Development Council.
Speaking on the occasion, Sheikh Faisal said Qatar's relations with Taiwan date back to the 1970s and both countries have had a consistent economic policy for trade and investment cooperation.
"Discussing green energy is important from both business perspective and environment. Our government is actively working towards a more energy-efficient future for Qatar and private businesses also need to take action," he said.
"We are proud to receive this elite business delegation of green energy solution providers and we are looking forward to discuss how the new technological developments can be used to reduce our energy consumption and contribute to our country's sustainable energy production," he added.
Dr Chuang said,"With Qatar's plan to generate 20 percent of the country's energy needs through renewable sources by 2024 and to reduce its per capita energy consumption by 15 percent, I believe that Taiwanese solutions for energy-efficient buildings can play a significant role in achieving these goals."
Dr Chuang highlighted the importance of conserving energy in buildings, saying green buildings bring together a vast array of practices, techniques, and skills to reduce and ultimately eliminate the impacts of buildings on the environment and human health.
The seminar proceeded with each of the six Taiwanese green energy solution providers addressing sustainable energy topics and presenting their products that included heat insulation solar glass for use with zero energy buildings, LEED certification consultancy, eco smart glass to harvest solar power, and heat mirror insulating glass, a high performance and energy efficient glass product for both residential and commercial purposes.
On the sidelines of the seminar, Sheikh Faisal, Sheikh Turki, and Dr Chuang held a meeting and discussed ways to enhance cooperation between Qatar and Taiwan.
