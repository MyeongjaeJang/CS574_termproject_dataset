Dulsco Raises Green Awareness at Doha College Posted on Comments Dulsco , a regional leader in environmental solutions, has conducted environmental awareness sessions at Doha College, on both Al Waab and West Bay campuses to an audience of ‘intrigued’ students. The focus of the awareness week was to educate the younger generation about the importance of recycling. The topics covered include waste definition, and identification of different types of wastes and how to segregate it. The collaboration between Dulsco and Doha College highlighted to students their responsibilities towards the environment, and how to preserve the natural heritage of Qatar. The primary school students were keen to participate in the interactive presentations delivered by three speakers from Dulsco – Nicola Maxwell, Regional Head of Commercial; Allan DeCampo, Sales Manager; and Sholto Diack, HSE Consultant. There were also exciting live demonstrations of the compactor and skip loader , much to the delight of students. The campaign included the collection of plastic bottles for recycling. Plastic bottles brought from home during the week reached a staggering 188 kg . As responsible corporate citizens, Dulsco Qatar and Doha College make it a priority to collaborate to help the community move closer towards achieving Qatar National Vision 2030 . In September 2016, Doha College became the first school in Qatar to be awarded the coveted Eco-Schools status from Denmark-based Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE) , under their scheme for international schools.
