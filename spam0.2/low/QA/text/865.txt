QATAR'S hosting of the 51st Executive Council Meeting and 23rd General Assembly (GA) of International Civil Defense Organization (ICDO) is an important opportunity for serious action and joint international cooperation to address risks and disasters, Director-General of Public Security HE Saad bin Jassim al Khulaifi has said.
In his speech at the opening session on Tuesday, Khulaifi stressed that strengthening international cooperation and partnership in the area of civil protection and disaster risk reduction, which threatens societies, contribute to enhancing response capacity and disaster management.
He expressed confidence that decisions at the meetings would meet the aspirations and expectations of the member states and contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the states in the field of civil protection.
"The world needs to understand all dimensions of disaster risk," he said, pointing out that despite international and regional efforts in disaster reduction, thousands of people in some countries are at risk and as a result lose their lives.
Khulaifi expressed confidence in the decisions of Doha 2018 that will be issued by the Executive Council and will be endorsed by the ICDO, especially since the organisation has pledged to take the responsibility throughout (2015-2025) to support member states in disaster response. (QNA)
