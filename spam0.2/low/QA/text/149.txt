After the success of Doha's first ever week dedicated to women in 2017, this year Richard Mille honours their ladies clients on the occasion of Mother's Day with another enticing event.
Taking the experience to a new high, the boutique is transformed into an elegant boudoir. With a refined interior design style and elements true to the brand such as the red rose it is a true immersion into the Richard Mille universe.
For the occasion, the boutique showcases an exclusive selection of ladies watches from jewellery pieces to high-complications and limited editions.
In partnership with All Bin Ali, Richard Mille invites Qatari ladies between the 19th and 22nd of March to experience the Richard Mille brand and discover a range of watches available in Doha especially for the Ladies Week 2018 edition.
