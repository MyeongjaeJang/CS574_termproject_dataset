DOHA Ever since the trade embargo was imposed on Qatar in June 2017, Al Meera has brought in over 20,000 individual items as direct replacement for products from blockading countries, its Chairman Sheikh Thani bin Thamer bin Mohammed al Thani has said.
"We will tirelessly continue to stick to the programme of importing directly from friendly nations, which has brought a change in the buying culture of companies," Sheikh Thani said on Tuesday.
He said the direct import programme has resulted in the ability to source new varieties of products that are similar to the previously available products, but at lower prices, benefitting customers in the country. ‚Äù (Asif Iqbal)
