THE Ministry of Interior (MoI) honoured some of the veteran drivers at a ceremony held in the presence of Director General of Public Security Major General Saad bin Jassim al Khulaifi and a number of officials and officers of the ministry in Doha on Wednesday morning.
This annual celebration comes within the framework of the activities of the 34th Traffic Week, which started last Sunday under the title 'Your Life is a Trust' and will continue until Saturday.
Director-General of Traffic Brigadier Muhammad Saad al Kharji said that this honour, which MoI organise annually to celebrate the veteran drivers, reflects MoI's appreciation of citizens who adhere to the ethics and rules of traffic.
Brigadier Kharji in a speech delivered on his behalf by Director of Road Engineering and Safety Brigadier Mohammed Abdul Rahim Marafih, called on the young drivers to follow the example of parents who have provided great examples of leadership. He pointed out that adherence to traffic rules and etiquette is one of the most important pillars of traffic safety, which aims to preserve the lives and property that is wasted by accidents.
He stressed the importance of concerted efforts by the authorities of the State, as well as private bodies and institutions, to spread traffic awareness and instil the foundations of commitment to the ethics and rules of traffic among the members of society, in order to protect all road users.
The honorees expressed their appreciation for this generous gesture by MoI, represented by the General Directorate of Traffic, noting the constant care to honour the veteran drivers each year on the sidelines of the Traffic Week activities.
