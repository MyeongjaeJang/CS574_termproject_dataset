All government services will be made available online by 2020, and this will help government turn a smart one, Minister of Transport and Communications HE Jassim bin Saif al Sulaiti has said.
"In Qatar, currently there are more than 2,400 digital services available, including more than 600 mobile services," Sulaiti told mediapersons during the launch of Digital Transformation Programme for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Qatar.
He said,"Cross-border flow of data across the Middle East to the rest of the world over the past decade has increased by over 150 times, with 160 million potential digital users by 2025, which can contribute up to 3.8 percent per year of GDP, equivalent to approximately $95 billion."
The Ministry of Transport and Communications is working on implementing the Qatar Smart Programme to promote smart solutions in five key economic sectors to accelerate the achievement of the pillars of Qatar National Vision 2030.
"Citizens also contribute to the digital transformation. From the perspective of digital deployment among individuals, Qatar ranks first in the use of the Internet worldwide. Qatar is one of the countries that topped the jump in the digital consumption sector in terms of high rates of dependence on smart phones and the use of social media."
