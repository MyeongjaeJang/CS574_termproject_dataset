Frankfurt: The head of German car giant Volkswagen, still grappling with the fallout from a huge emissions cheating scandal, on Friday defended his 10-million-euro salary by saying it made up for the risk of having"one foot in jail". In an interview with news weekly Der Spiegel, Matthias Mueller said he did not understand the fuss in Germany about chief executives' pay packets."It's an extremely emotional topic," said Mueller, who took home just over 10 million euros ($12.3 million) in 2017, up 40 percent on the previous year.
