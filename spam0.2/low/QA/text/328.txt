He said that Qatar appreciates and values its relationship with India and reiterates its commitment to effectively contribute to satisfying India’s growing energy demand, including the reliable delivery of LNG and other hydrocarbons. I would like to thank the Indian government and all the executives and energy leaders we met, for their hospitality and constructive discussions. We look forward to more cooperation between our companies.’ India is a strategic partner for Qatar Petroleum. Its business relationship includes LNG supplies and other energy products to fuel the vibrant Indian economy. India also represents one of Qatar’s largest markets with more than 10 million tonnes delivered annually in recent years. Qatargas supplies multiple customers in India and is the single largest LNG supplier to the country. In 1999, RasGas (now Qatargas) and Petronet LNG Limited signed a long-term SPA for 7.5 million tonnes per annum of LNG. This was followed in December 2015 with a new SPA for the supply of an additional one million tonnes per annum, raising the total annual long-term commitment between the two companies to 8.5 million tonnes per annum.
