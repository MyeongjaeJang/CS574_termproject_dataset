Washington: German footballer Bastian Schweinsteiger and his Serbian wife Ana Ivanovic, a former tennis number one, have welcomed a baby boy, they announced late Sunday.
"Welcome to the world our little boy. Words can not describe the joy and the happiness we feel in our hearts!" Ivanovic wrote on Twitter."We are so happy," Schweinsteiger added on Instagram, posting a black-and-white picture of their hands with the baby's feet.
The pair, who live in Chicago, where Schweinsteiger plays for Chicago Fire, married in Venice in 2016 and have been together since 2014. Ivanovic, who won the French Open in 2008, retired from professional tennis in 2016 after struggling with injuries. The couple have not said what they will call their new son, but Serbian media reported that he would be named Luka. (dpa)
