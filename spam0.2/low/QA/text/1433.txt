Atletico Madrid beat Deportivo La Coruna 1-0~ courtesy of a Kevin Gameiro penalty in La Liga on Sunday.
The win keeps them second, nine points behind leaders Barcelona but four points clear of third-placed Real Madrid who they face in next weekend's Madrid derby.
Gameiro scored from the spot 34 minutes after Pedro Mosquero had tugged Saul Niguez' shirt in the area.
Atletico Madrid captain Gabi said:"He had hold of the shirt I don't know if it was enough to concede a penalty but that was the referee's decision.
"They have the players to be higher up the league and they made it difficult for us."
Those sentiments will be of little consolation to Deportivo coach Clarence Seedorf who was celebrating his 42nd birthday. He has now been in charge for eight games and the team is yet to win. They are on a run of 15 matches without a win and are eight points from safety with eight games remaining.
Deportivo forward Adrian Lopez said:"The plan was working well so it's a real shame that for one isolated incident we lose the game."
Earlier on Sunday, Rodrigo Moreno scored to earn Valencia a 1-0 win at Leganes keeping them fourth.
It was goal number 14 in the league for the Spain striker and it means~Valencia have now won their last four games.
