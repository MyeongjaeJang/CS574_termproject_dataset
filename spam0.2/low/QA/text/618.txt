RESEARCHERS at Agriculture Research Department (ARD) have developed a 'high productivity' date palm to enhance date production for the future.
This date palm would have the capacity to produce 50 percent more yield, according to a researcher at ARD.
The highly productive date palm has been developed through tissue culture at a Doha laboratory of Agriculture Research Department of the Ministry of Municipality and Environment (MME).
Speaking to Qatar Tribune on the sidelines of an exhibition recently, and describing the new features of the palm tree, a researcher at Agriculture Research Department, Muneera al Marri, said:"The new form of date palm has not been given any official name. However, it has the capacity to produce 50 percent more yield. A team of researchers have developed the palm tree from high quality tissues collected from best quality trees. The new palm would have the ability to resist itself from common diseases. Long life, high productivity and high quality yield are the main targets and features."
One of most popular varieties, 'Khalasah', known for its sweetness has been reportedly selected for the tissue culture."The new tree will also give yield earlier than the existing or traditional trees. A total of 1,000 such date palm trees have been distributed to farmers and its growth is being currently monitored."
In 2009, a team of researchers at Qatar Foundation had published a draft version of the date palm genome of 'Khalasah' variety.
Muneera further said that their researchers have also developed varieties of fast growing grass and mangrove in an effort to"make the country more greener and support the existing environment".
