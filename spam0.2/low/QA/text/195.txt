Qatar has renewed its full support to the Palestinian people for self-determination and the restoration of all their legitimate rights, foremost of which is the establishment of an independent and sovereign state on the 1967 borders with Jerusalem as its capital.
Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations (UN) Office at Geneva HE Ambassador Ali Khalfan al Mansouri made the statement during the 37th session of the Human Rights Council, item seven entitled human rights situation in Palestine and other occupied Arab territories.
Mansouri stressed the importance of the seventh item on the agenda of the Human Rights Council, underlining the need to participate in it for its importance in documenting and highlighting the crimes and violations of human rights committed against the Palestinian people for more than 70 years.
He added that Israel, the occupying power, is obliged to comply with the relevant international laws, treaties and resolutions, stressing that the continuation of the demolition of Palestinian homes and the confiscation of their lands are flagrant violations of international law.
He added that the transfer of Israeli settlers to the settlements is a clear violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and is considered a war crime.
Ambassador Mansouri stressed that the continued imposition of the siege and the collective punishment policy adopted by the occupation authorities against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip since 11 years ago have further exacerbated humanitarian situation, which many international reports have warned against.
He urged the international community to take all necessary measures to end the siege and support the reconstruction efforts in the Strip, and to ensure that its inhabitants enjoy all their legitimate rights.
Mansouri said that the continuation of Israeli violations and crimes against Palestinians, in the absence of any accountability of those responsible for the violations and crimes and the absence of any real effort by the international community to find a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian question, would bring international peace and security to greater danger.
