The International Cycling Union (UCI) will on Wednesday unveil a beefed-up set of measures and an arsenal of methods to detect so-called mechanical doping.
When Frenchman David Lappartient took over the UCI in September, he promised to deliver a package of measures to tackle the menace of miniature motors in professional cycling, ahead of the current season.
Lappartient has appointed the 2014 Tour de France runner-up Jean-Christophe Peraud, a trained engineer, to manage a commission looking into the issue.
Femke Van den Driessche became the first competitive cyclist to be found using a motorised bike in 2016 at the junior world cyclo-cross championships, an offence which saw the Belgian national junior champion receive a six-year ban from the International Cycling Union.
The suspicion is that tiny motors hidden in the frame of a bike are being temporarily switched on at key moments of races such as climbs or when riding into headwinds.
At a meeting in Geneva on Wednesday Lappartient is set to unveil a series of fresh measures.
"This problem is of key importance," says the UCI chief.
"We will of course be using x-rays, thermal cameras and detectors and physical dismantling (of bikes)," Lappartient said."But there are other technologies that can be used."
"We shall set to work in the world of research in order to create a method whereby television images will reveal sudden surges of power and detect anomalies right away," the UCI president explained.
