Michael Vartan, who dated actress Jennifer Garner before she got married to Ben Affleck, says he was not considering a reconciliation with her.
Vartan and Garner dated from August 2003 to mid 2004.
Now that Garner has split from Affleck, some people may think that the Alum actress will stand a chance to reunite with Vartan, but he has ruled it out, reports eonline.com.
"Oh my God. I don't think so. If it didn't work once, there's a reason it didn't work," he said.
"Everyone's getting single. It's crazy. Everyone's realising that is so much easier to be single. I love relationships. When they work, when they're great, they're great and when they're not, they're not," added Vartan.
