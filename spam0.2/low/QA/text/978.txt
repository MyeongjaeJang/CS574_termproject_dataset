The Public Works Authority (Ashghal) will close part of Al Furousiya Street in the three lanes leading from Al Furousiya Roundabout (Equestrian R/A) to Muaither Roundabout from Sunday, April 1, 2018 for a period of five months, in coordination with the General Directorate of Traffic.
During the period, traffic will be diverted to three lanes parallel to the closed section of Al Furousiya Street.
The diversion will facilitate construction works as part of Al Furousiya Street Development Project, which includes increasing the number of lanes of Al Furousiya Street to four lanes in each direction with a service road on both sides of the street, in order to enhance traffic flow and increase the street capacity to accommodate current and future traffic requirements.
The project also includes converting Al Furousiya and Muaither Roundabouts into signal-controlled intersections to ease traffic congestion in the area, in addition to providing street lighting and pedestrian and cyclist lanes, among other works.
