The Qatar branch of TNO, one of Europe's largest independent R&D organisations with its Middle East Office in Qatar, and the Student Chapter of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) conducted an interactive workshop on Intelligent Fields for Texas A&M University Qatar students recently. This was the 5th edition of the workshop that has become an annual event designed to introduce the concepts, application and benefits of incorporating the intelligent features such as real time data acquisition and process automation in the management of oil and gas fields.
Intelligent oil field technologies maximise recovery from oil and gas fields, eliminate non-productive time, and increase profitability through the design and deployment of integrated workflows. Digital oilfield workflows combine business process management with advanced information technology and engineering expertise to streamline and, in many cases, automate the execution of tasks performed by cross-functional teams.
During the workshop TNO's intelligent field experts introduced the basic features of the technology including new sensors, well design, high density data processing associated workflows that convert raw data into actionable information. In addition to the technologies, the students were also introduced to other key aspects of intelligent field operation such as teamwork, organizational structure for optimum efficiency.
A very popular feature of the workshop was a classroom Intelligent Field Design contest where student groups are presented with a challenge to develop their own design and operating strategy for a hypothetical field to strengthen the learnings from sessions on key features of intelligent fields. This year's event was a characterized by a highly inquisitive and competitive group of engineering students making it a remarkable success in learning, interactive discussions and a fiercely fought design contest.
Mohamed al Balushi, President of the Student Chapter of SPE Qatar Section, complimented TNO for organising"yet another incredibly energetic and productive workshop" and noted that"the flow of information was extremely well-structured and the overall execution both exceeded our expectations and left the participants with a tangible sense of fulfillment".
