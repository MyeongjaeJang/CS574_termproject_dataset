Qatar Petroleum has joined the largest gathering of oil and gas companies in Oman with a strong presence at the eleventh Oil and Gas West Asia (OGWA) Exhibition and Conference.
The OGWA Exhibition, which is held under the auspices of Oman's ministry of oil and gas, was inaugurated on Sunday by Mohammed bin Al Zubair, the Advisor to Oman for Economic Planning Affairs, at the Oman Convention and Exhibition Centre in Muscat.
Zubair visited Qatar Petroleum's exhibition stall with other top government officials.
They were briefed on the corporation's history as well as some of its most important achievements in the oil and gas industry and its expanding upstream footprint across the globe.
Qatar Petroleum is taking part in the event along with Qatar Chemical and Petrochemical Marketing and Distribution Company (Muntajat), which serves as the gateway to Qatar's exports of chemicals and petrochemicals products.
The three-day exhibition will be held until Wednesday and includes, on its sidelines, a conference on enhanced oil recovery techniques, which was inaugurated on Sunday by Oman's Minister of Oil and Gas Mohammed bin Hamad al Rumhi.
QP's participation at OGWA 2018 comes a few months after the corporation entered into an agreement with Eni of Italy to acquire a 30 percent participating stake in the Contractor's interest under the exploration and production sharing agreement for Block 52 offshore Oman.
The agreement was signed in November 2017 by Qatar Petroleum President and CEO Saad Sherida al Kaabi in the presence of Oman's minister of oil and gas.
Qatar and Oman also have close links in the oil and gas industry through the Dolphin Gas Project, which processes up to 2 billion standard cubic feet per day of natural gas from Qatar's North Field. The gas is then transported by pipeline and distributed to customers in the United Arab Emirates and Oman.
