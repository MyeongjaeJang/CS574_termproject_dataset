Berlin: Europe's ruling body UEFA said Tuesday it will ease its player registration rules from next season onwards, allowing more January signings to play in the Champions League and Europa League for their new clubs."A club may register three new eligible players without any restrictions," UEFA said, up from one per club this season and in line with domestic league rules which also have no eligibility restrictions on January signings. Under the current rule Borussia Dortmund had to decide whether to register Manuel Akanji or Michy Batshuayi for the Europa League, while Barcelona can't use Philippe Coutinho in the Champions League and Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang also can't play in the Europa League because their previous clubs were in the same event. UEFA also said that teams in knock-out matches of the Champions League, Europa League and the Super Cup match can use a fourth substitute in extra-time of games. (dpa)
