Singer Kylie Minogue is unsure whether she'll ever find love again.
The 49-year-old singer has been single since splitting from Joshua Sasse last February and despite failed romances with Olivier Martinez, Andres Velencoso, the late Michael Hutchence and Jason Donovan, she still believes in love and has hope that she'll still find the right person someday.
"The first flush of love, that's the best. I know people often like to paint me as a bit of a failure in that department, but maybe it's not my destiny yet to have met the one. There's a lot of pressure on the one," Minogue told OK! magazine.
She added:"And you know, there's a part of me that thinks, maybe they're out there. And then another part of me that thinks, maybe they're not. Maybe that's just not for everyone."
The Stop me from falling hitmaker said that it's really tough going through a break-up in the public eye, but she knows she'll eventually start dating again and find herself back under scrutiny, reports femalefirst.co.uk.
She said:"It's full on. And when you've had a kind of public romance as well, there's a point where you think, 'Can I go through this again?' No doubt I will. And it may be a different set of highs and lows and dramas and whatever but that's part of life."
