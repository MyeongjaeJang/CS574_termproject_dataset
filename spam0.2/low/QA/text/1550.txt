DARFUR Commissioner for Voluntary Return, Taj al-din Ibrahim al-Tahir, has praised the State of Qatar's fulfillment of all its pledges and commitments regarding the reconstruction of the Darfur region, stressing that Doha has greatly supported stability and comprehensive peace in the region.
In an interview with Qatar News Agency (QNA), al-Tahir said that the commission appreciates the commitment of the State of Qatar to construct 75 model villages in Darfur with 15 in each state throughout the agreed stages, pointing out that during the first phase of this project, five villages were established. He noted that the second phase of the project started and includes the establishment of 10 villages, two in each state.
He explained that these villages will make a comprehensive change in the targeted areas, and will transform them into modern cities that will contribute to strengthening the peace process in Darfur, as it will motivate displaced people and refugees to return voluntarily to their homes, noting that the second phase of the project is in the advanced stages.
The commissioner reaffirmed the role of the Qatari charitable organisations in the establishment of social peace, especially the Qatar Red Crescent Society and Qatar Charity, as they played a vital role in consolidating the peace march in Sudan.
The Sudanese official expected that the coming period will witness a rapid pace of completion of the system of model villages because of the progress of the recovery processes taking place in the region, pointing out that the model villages contain modern service complexes, including primary and secondary schools, health centers, modern hospitals, medical laboratories, as well as the provision of means of livelihood accompanying with these projects.
Moreover, he explained that these villages will be able to accommodate thousands of residents and will include all modern city services. He noted that project studies also confirmed the positive effects of these Qatari model villages on the nearly 38,000 people returning to their homes in the region, pointing out that this number can increase significantly, especially that during the month of April a comprehensive survey will be held to accurately determine the number of returnees to develop plans for stability and rehabilitation.
In conclusion, al-Tahir said that the current phase of the peace process in Darfur is witnessing work of the commissions on the ground in fulfillment of the commitments of the Doha Peace Document in Darfur, pointing at the same time to the existence of a large voluntary return for displaced and refugees of various regions.
