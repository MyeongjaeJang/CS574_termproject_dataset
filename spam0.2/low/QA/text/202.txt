Paris: French Open director Guy Forget hit out on Tuesday at the ATP's plans to restart the World Team Cup, saying it could hurt the fortunes of the historic Davis Cup. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) announced last month a plan to run the Davis Cup -- traditionally played over four weekends spread across the season -- over a single week in November from next year.
Separately the ATP is hoping to revive the World Team Cup to be played for the first time in eight years in January 2020, possibly only two months after the Davis Cup."We could end up with two strictly identical competitions a few weeks apart, which I think would be dangerous," said former world number four Forget.
