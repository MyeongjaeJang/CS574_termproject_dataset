Usain Bolt will have a trial with Borussia Dortmund on Friday, the 31-year-old Jamaican sprint star confirmed late on Wednesday via his personal Twitter account.
Bolt tweeted a drawing of himself in a Dortmund strip alongside the words:"BVB, get ready for Friday." BVB is a term commonly used in Germany to refer to Dortmund.
The club also confirmed the trial via Twitter, saying that the training session with the eight-time Olympic gold medallist, who is now retired, would be open to the public but have a limited spectator capacity.
Both Bolt and Dortmund are sponsored by Puma, who tweeted a screenshot of the Pro Evolution Soccer video game featuring a Dortmund player with Bolt's head superimposed onto it, complete with the words:~"They said it would never happen."
Bolt has said he is serious about beginning a new career in professional football. A Manchester United supporter, he has said previously that becoming a footballer was his dream as a child.
"For me, it's a personal goal," he said in October last year."I don't care what people really think about it."
At the end of February, Bolt tweeted that he had"signed for a football team."~It turned out that the team was in fact the Soccer Aid World XI, a collection of celebrities captained by singer Robbie Williams who are playing a benefit game in aid of children's charity UNICEF on June 10 at Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium.
