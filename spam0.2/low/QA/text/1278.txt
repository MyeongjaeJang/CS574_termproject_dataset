Qatar Institute for Speech and Hearing (QISH), an institute operated by a group of Indian professionals, observed World Down Syndrome Day in Doha, recently.
Down syndrome also known as Trisomy 21 is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21. It is typically associated with physical growth delays, characteristic facial features and mild to moderate intellectual disability.
Supporting the theme of this year 'What I Bring to My Community' QISH has organised several activities at public places including Souq Waqif, where a large number of people gather every day.
Speaking to Qatar Tribune, QISH Marketing and Promotional Officer Mohamed Ashraf said that educating parents and creating awareness about the importance of early identification and intervention, and how to support parents is always the concern of QISH.
Events of this kind will provide opportunities to people affected with Down syndrome to interact with the general public and increase their level of confidence. That will always help them to lead a normal life.
The rehabilitation centre of QISH has also initiated many fun activities for these children and their parents including exhibition of handmade crafts made by the children, cultural activities and awareness sessions for the parents. A ceremonial cake was cut on the occasion to mark the event.
