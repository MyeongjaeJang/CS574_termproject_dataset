QATAR University (QU) Volunteerism and Community Service Center launched its upcoming competition titled 'Rofaqa' at a media briefing held at QU.
Details of the competition were outlined by QU President Dr Hassan al Derham and Qatar Charity CEO Yusuf bin Ahmed al Kuwari in the presence of officials from QU and Qatar Charity (QC), and representatives of the local media.
Organised in collaboration with QC, the Rofaqa competition will be held from April 1 until May 10. It aims to engage QU students in humanitarian work and to encourage them to provide care to 1,000 orphans. The competition also aims to develop students' capacity and skills through workshops in the field of social work and marketing, and to promote the spirit of social engagement among them.
Five student teams from QU will organise a marketing plan, using all means of advertising and promotional campaigns. They will participate in a number of workshops organised in collaboration with QU Volunteerism and Community Service Center. The evaluation criteria include the number of sessions attended by the team, creating marketing campaigns, earning support on social media, organising events and activities that raise awareness about the 'Rofaqa' initiative, and providing care to 200 orphans during the entire year.
The participating teams must prepare a brief report about their achievements. Winners will be announced by the judging committee during the first week of May. The winning team will spend a day with the orphans and will receive appreciation certificates and trophies.
In his remarks, Dr Derham said:"We are pleased to welcome Qatar Charity, Qatar's largest NGO, which plays a key role in carrying out humanitarian programs in areas of crisis all over the world. Qatar University places social responsibility on top of its values. We encourage QU students and members to participate in the 'Rofaqa' competition." (TNN)
