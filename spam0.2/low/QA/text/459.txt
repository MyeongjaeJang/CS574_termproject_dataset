Banna is the daughter of a well-known Palestinian poet, Zouhaira Sabbagh, who wrote on her Facebook page, "she [Rim Banna] departed and left behind her bright smile."
Last week, her family issued a statement to highlight her deteriorating medical condition, telling her fans that she was receiving treatment in one of the hospitals in Nazareth.
"She is continuing to resist … she will even announce new plans and reveal details of an upcoming musical tour," the statement read.
The artist, who was diagnosed in 2009, lost the ability to sing two years ago and said she was stepping down but would continue to compose and create music.
Banna has performed the world over with patriotic music that called for an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestine .
She would often appear wearing traditionally-embroidered gowns and a keffiyeh, a symbol of Palestinian independence, over her shoulders.
