Huawei, in partnership with Salam Technology, has been successfully awarded a new high capacity CCTV Storage project for Hamad International Airport (HIA), according to a press release.
Huawei provided 10 Petabyte CCTV Storage with a five-fold scalability option for the next five years.
With the enormous amount of passengers, cargo, airlines, retail and staff data being handled by the airport, HIA had a substantial storage requirement for the next five years. HIA's immediate storage requirement needed to be scalable up to 50 PB with high bandwidth capacity and the ability to meet 99.999% availability.
To meet these requirements, Huawei provided a complete CCTV storage solution with OceanStor 9000 product that delivers a shared storage with cutting-edge performance, open interfaces, simple system management and maintenance, and above all large scale expansion capabilities.
Despite the fierce competition, Huawei was able to win the trust of HIA through this future-proof highly scalable storage system, and Huawei's strong local presence with its industry leading professional implementation and support services. The successful delivery of this project will enable HIA to have a cost effective solution with the industry's highest capacity disks ever, which will ensure highly available, robust and secure operations at lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).
