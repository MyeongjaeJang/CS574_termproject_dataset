In a welcome step towards ensuring safety of school children, the Traffic Department has installed a new radar system on public school buses on a trial basis.
The new radar system will help identify drivers who illegally overtake school buses while they drop students at the bus stops.
Developed by Mowasalat, the radars will be gradually installed in school buses.
"It is a new innovation to ensure safety of schoolchildren. The new smart school bus will be equipped with more safety measures," said Lieutenant Azzan al Kathiri from the Traffic Department.
"When the school bus stops and students cross the road, a stop sign is activated by the bus driver. The radar installed on the bus will then be able to detect any vehicle that overtakes it," he added.
"Reckless driving causes many accidents. The traffic department urges drivers to wait for school buses to safely drop students before they overtake and move on," he said.
Moreover, Kathiri said the school buses also have seatbelts for each seat and are equipped with CCTV cameras.
"They also have TV screens that display awareness programmes for students. The buses have emergency exits," Kathiri said.
He said even the engines of the buses are modified in a such a way that they stop automatically in case of a fire. The tyres are also puncture-proof.
"Students' safety is a top priority for us. The tyre bolts are sealed with red plastic so the driver can check that nobody has fiddled with them before starting the journey," Kathiri added.
"The new school buses are the first of their kind in the region. We convey our gratitude to Mowasalat for this innovation," Kathiri said.
