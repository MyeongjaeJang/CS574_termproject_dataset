Title holders Germany gathered on Tuesday for two high-profile World Cup tune-ups against Spain and Brazil, with the players seemingly ready to go to work according to their new slogan"Best Never Rest."
Forward Thomas Mueller spoke of"two top teams" and expressed hope that the Germans will dominate Brazil as in their last meeting in the 2014 semi-finals although he doesn't expect the same result - with the Germans famously prevailing 7-1 over the then World Cup hosts.
The game against the record five-time World Cup champions Brazil is Tuesday in Berlin, but first comes the Friday date in Dusseldorf against the 2010 world and 2008 and 2012 European champions Spain.
"Both are attractive opponents. They are different teams but both world class. We want to see where we are," defender Jerome Boatend said.
Tuesday was reserved for marketing activities as the new slogan was unveiled along with the new away kit, with the green shirts resembling those with which the Germans won the third of their four titles in 1990.
Training for the last friendlies ahead of Joachim Loew's provisional World Cup squad nomination in mid-May starts Wednesday.
"We have another good opportunity for testing and to measure ourselves against two of the best teams in the world," midfielder Leon Goretzka said.
Loew has selected 26 players - including 17 from last year's Confed Cup winning side and eight from the 2014 World Cup - for two games.
Germany have two final friendlies against Austria and Saudi Arabia before the June 14-July World Cup in Russia where they meet Mexio, Sweden and South Korea in the group stage.
