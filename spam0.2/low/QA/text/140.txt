Oryx Publishing and Advertising unveiled the 2017-18 edition of its annual publication Progress Qatar, held under the patronage of the Ministry of Culture and Sports, recently. The event, officially sponsored by Q-Auto, was held to mark Qatar's achievements in various sectors last year in the face of the blockade imposed on it by some of its neighbours.
Oryx Publishing & Advertising Chairman Yousuf bin Jassim al Darwish and Ministry of Culture and Sports Director (Research and Cultural Studies Department) Faleh bin Hussein al Hajri were among the prominent personalities present at the function. Hajri attended the event on behalf of the Minister of Culture and Sports HE Salah bin Ghanem bin Nasser al Ali.
Darwish thanked the participants of Progress Qatar 2017-18 and said that Qatar's economy had thrived despite the embargo imposed on it in June last year. He also stressed the importance of the latest edition of Progress Qatar because it highlighted how well the nation had coped with the situation.
The unveiling of Progress Qatar 2017-2018 by Darwish and Hajri was followed by the awards ceremony giving away Progress Qatar 2017-2018 trophies which was initiated by Hajri receiving an award from Darwish. Q Auto, the official sponsor for the event, was then presented with an award by Darwish and Hajri, which was received by company General Manager Ahmed Shariefi.
A special award was also given to Qatari artist Ali Hassan, whose painting was used for the cover of Progress Qatar 2017-18. Darwish and Hajri then presented awards to the representatives of the participating companies who were present at the ceremony.
Progress Qatar has been providing detailed analysis of the nation's developments in various fields - sports, economy, infrastructure, education, health, etc. - for over a decade. The inaugural edition of the yearly book was published in 2003-04.
