Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto, acclaimed for creating a bridge between the culinary traditions of his native Japan and the American palate and for bringing intense and perfectly balanced flavours to diners throughout the world, participated in the 9th edition of Qatar International Food Festival. On the festival's opening night, he entertained fans with a demonstration on preparing a 175-pound tuna fish.
He later spoke to the media giving an insight into preparing fish, participating in QIFF and some personal trivia. Excerpts:
Q: You opened your first restaurant in the Middle East in Doha last October. Why did you choose Qatar?
A: Qatar has a culture that is very different from that of my home country, Japan, and so it is an exciting opportunity to gain more experience and to hone my culinary skills. I am also happy to see fish has a central role in the traditional local cuisine but treated very differently from how we serve it in Japan.
How does it feel to be part of QIFF, the country's signature food festival?
It was a big surprise and honour to be here alongside my hero Wolfgang Puck to kick off the biggest food festival in the country!
What's the most important thing you need to master to be able to tackle such a big yet delicate fish?
A big tuna and small fish are the same, just that a Tuna needs more experience. These massive tuna butchery demonstrations are mainly for special occasions such as restaurant launches so I have done them maybe several times a year over the past decade.
When you're not in the kitchen, how do you spend your time?
I like to find a state of stillness of mind in meditation.
One last word to the fans
Come try my food at the Mondrian in Doha!
