The Emir HH Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani's two-day Russia visit that began on Sunday opens new horizons for cooperation and strategic partnership, Qatar's Ambassador to Russia HE Fahd bin Mohammed al Attiyah has said.
The first by a leader after the re-election of Vladimir Putin as the president, the Emir's visit to Moscow also emphasises the strength of Qatari-Russian relations, he said. It will see the two sides exchanging views on various regional crises, especially those in Palestine, Syria, Yemen and other areas of conflict in the Middle East.
"Both the countries aspire to increase investments, trade and economic cooperation," Attiyah said, adding that Qatar has the infrastructure for the Russian products to reach Doha through the country's ports and airports with ease.
The Emir's visit, to be followed by several meetings between businessmen of the two countries, will also pave the way for streamlining of several administrative and legal procedures to facilitate the movement of bilateral trade, Attiyah said.
As Russia hosts the FIFA World Cup in 2018, the Emir's visit will have a positive bearing on Qatar's hosting of 2022 edition, the ambassador said.
A Qatari team will be present before the start of 2018 World Cup to gain organisational experiences and transfer them to Qatar, Attiyah said.
"This is a natural cooperation between the countries hosting such events. This will strengthen relations between Doha and Moscow."
Moreover, he said, the Russian expertise in the field of security and other fields will also benefit Qatar.
