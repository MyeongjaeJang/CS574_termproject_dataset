Dusseldorf: Borussia Dortmund will likely be without their Germany forward Marco Reus in Saturday's Bundesliga top match at leaders Bayern Munich, and defender Omer Toprak is also doubtful. Injury-plagued Reus has been suffering from groin problems and already missed the last league match before the international break against Hanover. Like Toprak, he is training individually."I don't think there is enough time until the weekend," coach Peter Stoeger told the Ruhr Nachrichten paper Tuesday. Stoeger said that Andriy Yarmolenko and Shinji Kagawa will remain sidelined as well for at least another two weeks with a foot and ankle injury, respectively. Bayern can clinch a record-extending sixth straight league title with six games to spare if they beat Dortmund and second-placed Schalke don't win against lowly Freiburg. Dortmund are third, one point behind Schalke, in their bid for a Champions League berth. (dpa)
