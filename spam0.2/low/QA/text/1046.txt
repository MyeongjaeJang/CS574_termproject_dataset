The Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), in cooperation with Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) and Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC), organised a number of activities during the World Glaucoma Week 2018 (WGW), which was held under the theme 'Go Get Your Eyes Tested for Glaucoma, Save Your Sight'.
The ministry's Director of Health Promotion and Non-communicable Diseases Dr Sheikha al Anoud bint Mohammed al Thani said the World Glaucoma Week is held annually to raise awareness among community members about eye diseases that cause blindness, especially glaucoma. She pointed out that Qatar's keen attention to holding awareness-raising activities stems from the fact that glaucoma is the first cause of blindness among the country's population above the age of 50 years.
The ministry's Head of Non-Communicable Diseases Department Dr Khuloud al Ateeq al Mutawa stressed the importance of early detection, which plays a key role in reducing the impact on visual ability and preventing the development of the disease to the stage of visual disability or blindness, noting that many people with glaucoma do not notice it until the disease develops to reach advanced stages and sight significantly and permanently deteriorates.
On her part, National Coordinator of the Combating Blindness Program Dr Badriya al Malki said the medical campaigns held during the World Glaucoma Week have led to the discovery of new cases of glaucoma in people who did not have a history of the disease. She pointed out that Glaucoma causes permanent and progressive loss of vision without prior symptoms, stressing that early screening is the only way to detect a disease that has no signs or symptoms in its early stages.
