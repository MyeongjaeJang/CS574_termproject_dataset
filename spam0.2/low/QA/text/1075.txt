MILAN: The Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) has put forward a proposal to stage the 2026 Winter Olympics jointly in Milan and Turin, it said on Thursday.
CONI said in a statement that it had written a letter of intent to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) putting forward the two northern cities as potential hosts.
It added that a feasibility study had already been carried out and would be handed to the new Italian government when it is eventually formed, this month's election having produced a hung parliament. Turin staged the Winter Games in its own right in 2006. Sion in Switzerland and Stockholm have also expressed interest in the Games as well as cities from Austria, the United States and Canada, among others.
However, one Austrian city, Innsbruck, abandoned its plans to bid after they were rejected in a referendum.
