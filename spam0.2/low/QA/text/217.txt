Qatar Airways and Iberia Expand Codeshare Partnership Posted on Comments 
Qatar Airways and Iberia announced the expansion of their codeshare partnership, offering Iberia customers increased connectivity to destinations across the Middle East and Asia, as well as enhanced accessibility for Qatar Airways passengers to key destinations across Latin America. 
The new codeshare destinations can already be booked. The Qatar Airways code (QR) will be applied to routes operated by Iberia from Madrid to Panama City; Rio de Janeiro; Bogotá Medellín (MDE); Montevideo in Uruguay; and Santo Domingo in Dominican Republic. Qatar Airways currently offers double daily flights from Doha direct to Madrid. Starting this July, this will increase to 17 times weekly. 
Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker, said that expanding the codeshare partnership with Iberia has been a natural progression since both of them are members of the one world alliance. 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Iberia, Luis Gallego, said they too are very happy to expand the codeshare agreement with one world partner, Qatar Airways. 
With these additional routes, we will be able to provide our customers with greater access to the Middle East and Asia, offering even more choice to both business and leisure travellers.’ 
The enhanced partnership will also benefit members of both airlines’ frequent flyer programmes – Qatar Airways Privilege Club and Iberia Plus – as well as provide passengers with increased accessibility to Hamad International Airport (HIA), and Iberia’s hub at Madrid Airport Terminal 4.
