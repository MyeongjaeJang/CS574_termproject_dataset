Cristie Kerr fired eight birdies in an eight-under par 64 on Friday to take a five-shot lead after two rounds of the US LPGA Kia Classic in Carlsbad, California.
Kerr, 40, had a 36-hole total of 13-under 131 on an Aviara course softened by rain.
"I like winning, I like challenging myself," said Kerr, whose 20 LPGA victories include two in 2017."The golf ball doesn't know an age. I've always said that. As long as I stay hungry, (I'm) going to just keep playing.
"I'm trying not to put limits on myself right now," Kerr added."I've got some good things going on with my swing. I had a great round."
Kerr lifted the trophy in Carlsbad in 2015 with a final-round 65, setting a tournament scoring record of 20-under par.
Her 13-under total broke the previous 36-hole tournament record of 10-under, achieved by five players most recently Jenny Shin in 2016.
American Lizette Salas, Sweden's Caroline Hedwall and South Koreans Park Hee-young and Kim In-kyung shared second on 136.
Salas carded a 67, Kim posted a 69 and Park and Hedwall both signed for 70s.
"I really like this golf course," said Salas, a southern California native."My family gets to come out. (I had) so much confidence at the beginning of the week and (it) definitely showed the first two days."
Kerr opened with birdies at the par-five 10th and the par-three 11th. She added birdies at 16, 18 and the second, then birdied three in a row at six, seven and eight.
"I can see the subtleties that a lot of people can't," she said of reading the greens."It's a gift from God being able to do that. I've always had that so, I'm lucky."
