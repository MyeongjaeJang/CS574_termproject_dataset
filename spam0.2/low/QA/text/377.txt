A public apology by Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday failed to quell outrage over the hijacking of personal data from millions of people, as critics demanded the social media giant go much further to protect privacy.
Speaking out for the first time about the harvesting of Facebook user data by a British firm linked to Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, Zuckerberg admitted to betraying the trust of its two billion users, and promised to"step up".
Vowing to stop data leaking to outside developers, and to give users more control over their information, Zuckerberg said he was ready to testify before Congress, and was not opposed to tougher regulation of internet titans. (AFP)
