QATAR is an active partner in confronting all forms of extremism and terrorism and drying up their resources, Public Security Director-General HE Staff Major-General Saad bin Jassim al Khulaifi has said.
Speaking to the media on the sidelines of the INTERPA conference, Khulaifi said Qatar rejects all forms of violence and terrorism and is an active partner with the international community in combating and drying up its resources. Holding the conferences in Qatar is a clear evidence of the country's involvement in combating terrorism and its keenness to draw the attention of the world to the dangers of terrorism, he said.
Khulaifi stressed that combating terrorism will not be achieved without close cooperation among all world countries and the exchange of information.
"The world is witnessing new terrorist phenomena such as cybersecurity threats. This is one of the most dangerous types of terrorism at the level of individuals, communities and all countries," Khulaifi said, calling for the world to stand united in the face of terrorism. (QNA)
