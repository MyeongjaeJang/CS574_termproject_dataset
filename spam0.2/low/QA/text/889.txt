Kolkata Former champions Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) have enough cricketers to fill the big shoes of David Warner if the tainted Australia vice-captain is asked to step down as captain of the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise, feels teammate and India wicket-keeper batsman Wriddhiman Saha.
Warner, 31, is right in the eye of the storm surrounding the ball-tampering crisis with Australian media reports surfacing that the dashing southpaw is the"the central character"in the scandal that has rocked cricket.
SRH mentor and former India batting great V.V.S. Laxman has said the team management will wait for for Cricket Australia's decision on the player before commenting on his participation in the cash-rich T20 tournament.
"The decision is yet to be taken so I am assuming the team is planning for the season keeping him in mind. In hindsight, if he is not there, the team is strong enough to replace him,"Saha told reporters at the Calcutta Sports Journalists'Club days before leaving for Hyderabad to join the camp.
"If Warner is there, it will be great obviously. He has batted superbly for SRH in the last few years and as captain has done well too."But I feel, we have replacements to fill his void. It may not be 100 per cent as he is a quality player, but we can try and fill the gap,"said Saha.
Saha said if could be a problem initially since the team is built around the skipper but SRH have players to cope with it."The team was decided based on the captain. In that way, there can be an initial impact. But we have a strong reserve bench and I don't think it will be much of a problem,"he said.
