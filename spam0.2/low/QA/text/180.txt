Qatar has strongly condemned Israeli continued targeting of Palestinian children by killing, arresting and torturing them in a blatant defiance and violation of all international conventions, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Qatar stressed that Israel's continuation of settlement activities in the Palestinian territories is evidence that it is not interested in peace and its insistence to continue its racist policies, violations and crimes against the Palestinian people.
This came in a speech delivered by Permanent Representative of Qatar to the United Nations (UN) Office at Geneva HE Ambassador Ali Khalfan al Mansouri during the interactive dialogue with the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories since 1967 under the seventh item of the current thirty-seventh session of the Human Rights Council.
He said Israeli settlements are at the centre of many of the repeated violations of human rights against the Palestinians, as confirmed by the UN report made by Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories Michael Lynk.
He condemned Israeli authorities' denial of the UN Special Rapporteur access to the occupied Palestinian territories.
The ambassador described the crimes and violations committed against Palestinian children as a disgrace to humankind, urging the international community to end the violations and hold accountable all Israeli officials responsible for the actions.
Mansouri also pointed out that the report mentioned that about two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have been subjected to repeated aggression, unjust siege and denial of their basic rights, which is a clear violation that cannot be tolerated.
He noted that Qatar in February provided a $9 million emergency aid to the Gaza Strip in order to improve the deteriorating humanitarian situation and address the electricity crisis, along with providing a donation of $50 million to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) to enable it to ensure the continuation of its work and assume its responsibilities towards the Palestinian refugees, especially in education and health sectors.
Mansouri called for the immediate and full implementation of Security Council resolution 2334 on Israeli settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem.
