Eight-time champions Al Rayyan Club's five-set triumph in the QVA League against Qatar Sports Club was marred by an ugly scuffle at the QVA Hall here on Monday.
The Lions, powered by 21 points from Marcus, were 2-0 up and looked like coasting to another win. But Qatar Sports Club, the four-time winners, rallied back spiritedly and tied the set scores at 2-2.
Al Rayyan Club regained their poise and rhythm and shot ahead 8-3 and then 11-4 with a compact all-round game. A poor service at 6-13 by Qatar Sports Club set up the match point of the heated fixture and then Amar smashed the ball out to leave the opponents 25-19, 25-17, 21-25, 20-25, 15-6 winner after one hour and 58 minutes.
When the players were shaking hands after the match, the situation, which was already a bit tense due to verbal fight between the rival players, turned physical with Bairama Faye and Mubarak Dahi Waleed of Al Rayyan and Sofiyan of Qatar Sports Club in the thick of action.
However, other players and officials swung into action and separated them before something worse could happen. The Qatar Volleyball Association is taking this incident seriously and will punish the guilty after a probe. This was the 15th victory in a row for undefeated Al Rayyan, increasing their points tally to 43. This is a second time in the season that The Lions dropped a point due to a 3-2 victory. Earlier, Al Rayyan took five sets to overcome defending champions Police in the first phase of the league in November.
This was the sixth defeat for Qatar Sports Club in 15 matches. They are tied with Al Wakrah Club on points 25 each but the latter have played two more matches than them.
Apart from Marcus, Colombian William Bermudez and Faye collected 12 each for the winners, while Bilal secured 10 and Ivan Boroniak got nine.
For Qatar Sports Club, who have been runners-up in the League on nine occasions, Yousef logged a game-high 22 points with his power-packed spikes. Sofian supported him well with 17 and Amar chipped in 13. Middle player Pape notched up 10.
In another match, holders Police overpowered 25-time winners Al Arabi Club with a come-from-behind 16-25, 25-17, 27-25, 23-25, 15-12 victory to keep their challenge alive.
Police put up a gritty display after having lost the opener. They led 2-1 before Al Arabi forced the decider.
It was the 13th win for Police in 15 matches, raising their tally to 40 points. For Al Arabi, this was the fourth loss in 15 matches. They occupy the third spot with 34 points.
With this win, Police can hope to maintain pressure on leaders Al Rayyan as both will clash in the last game of the League next month. If both keep winning their matches till the upcoming big game, Police will need to beat Al Rayyan Club 3-0 or 3-1 to force a title playoff. If they can't, Al Rayyan Club will go on to bag the ninth crown on April 7.
