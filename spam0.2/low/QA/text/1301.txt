A Qatar Chamber (QC) delegation is likely to travel to Uganda later this month to study the investment opportunities in that country, which according to its Minister of Presidency Esther M Mbayo offers several incentives including tax holidays.
Uganda is keen to host the delegation from Qatar Chamber, Mbayo told QC Vice Chairman Mohammed bin Ahmed bin Towar al Kuwari, at a meeting in Doha on Sunday. The Ugandan minister was leading a trade delegation to Doha to discuss ways to fast track trade relations between the two countries.
Mbayo's Doha visit is a follow up to Uganda President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni's state visit in April last year. Qatar Chamber had reciprocated the president's visit by sending a business delegation led by Kuwari to Kampala to explore the investment opportunities in the East African Country.
At Sunday's meeting, Mbayo presented assurances from President Museveni about promoting and protecting the business interests of the Qatari Businessmen in Uganda.
Mbayo expressed her country's gratitude to QC for the commitment of the Qatari business community to invest in Uganda and fulfilling the bilateral agreements signed between the two countries during the state visit.
Terming the business climate in Uganda as investor-friendly, Mbayo said her country offers several investment opportunities in the fields of agro-processing, mining, agriculture, oil and gas, real estate development, tourism and Islamic banking.
