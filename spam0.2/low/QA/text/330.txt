Comments If you have not much to do on a weekend, why not try to go dhow cruising from the Corniche down to The Pearl-Qatar? Without the distraction of cars, the ride provides an amazing respite from traffic and offers an amazing view in between. Let’s Cruise! The dhow waiting for the Marhaba team along the harbour in Corniche was huge, and decorated with traditional Qatari colours. We set sail at exactly 4 pm. National Cruise , the company who arranged our afternoon dhow ride set out dates and nuts on our table to welcome us. Coffee and tea were also waiting on the side. If you’ve been on a dhow ride with one of the usual dhows lining up the bay, your expectations would not have been too high. But this ride was different. <span data-mce-type=&#8221;bookmark&#8221; style=&#8221;display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;&#8221; class=&#8221;mce_SELRES_start&#8221;>﻿</span><span data-mce-type=&#8221;bookmark&#8221; style=&#8221;display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;&#8221; class=&#8221;mce_SELRES_start&#8221;>﻿</span><span data-mce-type=&#8221;bookmark&#8221; style=&#8221;display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;&#8221; class=&#8221;mce_SELRES_start&#8221;>﻿</span><span data-mce-type=&#8221;bookmark&#8221; style=&#8221;display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;&#8221; class=&#8221;mce_SELRES_start&#8221;>﻿</span><span data-mce-type=&#8221;bookmark&#8221; style=&#8221;display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;&#8221; class=&#8221;mce_SELRES_start&#8221;><span data-mce-type=&#8221;bookmark&#8221; style=&#8221;display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;&#8221; class=&#8221;mce_SELRES_start&#8221;>﻿</span>﻿</span><span data-mce-type=&#8221;bookmark&#8221; style=&#8221;display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;&#8221; class=&#8221;mce_SELRES_start&#8221;>﻿</span><span data-mce-type=&#8221;bookmark&#8221; style=&#8221;display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;&#8221; class=&#8221;mce_SELRES_start&#8221;>﻿</span><span data-mce-type=&#8221;bookmark&#8221; style=&#8221;display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;&#8221; class=&#8221;mce_SELRES_start&#8221;>﻿</span><span data-mce-type=&#8221;bookmark&#8221; style=&#8221;display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;&#8221; class=&#8221;mce_SELRES_start&#8221;>﻿</span><span data-mce-type=&#8221;bookmark&#8221; style=&#8221;display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;&#8221; class=&#8221;mce_SELRES_start&#8221;>﻿</span><span data-mce-type=&#8221;bookmark&#8221; style=&#8221;display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;&#8221; class=&#8221;mce_SELRES_start&#8221;>﻿</span> The dhow, for one, reminded me of the coffee shops in Souq Waqif. Tables lined both sides of the main deck, and whichever side you choose to sit on, there is that wonderful view of the sea and the Doha skyline. The al fresco upper deck is also something one shouldn’t miss. You can opt to sit on the pillows and let the wind and the sun kiss your skin. Or you can stand by the rail and watch some water action. Halfway to The Pearl, we saw a huge turtle floating lazily on the waters. The view approaching The Pearl was magnificent. Its beautiful structures got us clicking away on our cameras. We stayed for at least half an hour, just enough time to freshen up and take in the view from the harbour. It was almost sunset when we returned back, but we hardly felt the two hours it took for us to make the round trip dhow ride from the Corniche to The Pearl and back. 

National Cruise offers a one-hour long cruise from The Pearl during weekends (Thursday to Saturday) for QAR100. Children 3 to 12 years old are charged QAR75. Tea, coffee and soft drinks are served at the main deck during the whole cruise. Light refreshments are also available.
