A number of African ambassadors gathered at the South African embassy pavilion at the ongoing Qatar International Food Festival (QIFF) at the Hotel Park on Wednesday for an opportunity to socialise and discuss relations in a relax atmosphere.
They were the Kenyan, Nigerian, South African, Algerian and Tanzanian ambassadors.
Speaking to Qatar Tribune, South African Ambassador to Qatar HE Faizel Moosa said that they came together so that they could represent Africa at the food festival.
He said the gathering was a great chance for them to meet on the African Union free trade agreement signed recently to promote trade without barriers across Africa.
"We also used the opportunity to showcase the South African food," he said, adding that people responded well to the South African pavilion at the festival.
"The outreach was a success. We believe that we transferred some of our culture to the Qataris as the visitors had the chance to enjoy spices in our food," said Ambassador Moosa.
He described the QIFF as an amazing festival, adding that he was impressed with the organisation and with the different foods that were represented.
"We are celebrating 100 years of Nelson Mandela at a culinary experience where the whole world comes together in different ways presenting their food and culture," he said.
On her part, Tanzanian Ambassador to Qatar HE Fatma Mohammed Rajab said,"This is a place where we can also showcase our culture through our traditional foods so that we can exchange experience not only Qataris but also other countries represented at the festival. I think this is the best way to learn about other countries."
