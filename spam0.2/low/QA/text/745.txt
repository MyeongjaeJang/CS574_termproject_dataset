Be it carrying your trendy capes or giving up on crop tops, give your style quotient a kick this spring and summer season.
Here are some to-do things from fashion stylist Avneet Chaadha and Kukoonthelabel Founder Sneha Mehta before you select your wardrobe for the coming season.
Cool denims
Styling for this coming season and not wearing denims would be too bad. Fill your wardrobe with some cool and chic denim bell-bottoms and crop denim jackets pairing it with regular plain t-shirts or bralets.
No to crop tops
It is too common to carry crop tops for every season now. The new thing in are the bralets. Pair your bright coloured bralets with your favourite summer shorts or you can pair them with the denim bell-bottoms.
Cape it up
What's cool and in trend are the stylish capes and shrugs for the season. Buying the new artistic print capes and shrugs and pairing them with your palazzos and your quirky shirts or t-shirts will keep you cool and stylish for the season.
Go Caribbean
People are so focused on getting bold colours and stripes that the most-fun-to-have collection is missed. Get yourself some cool Caribbean shirts and trousers to look chic for your night parties and look the best. Style them with a bright coloured silk top and your favourite pair of heels to complete the look.
Play it well with skirts
Heading for a meeting or rushing to a party, skirts come as a saviour. Go with bright coloured skirts for the season and pair them well with Caribbean frill shirts to get the perfect look.
