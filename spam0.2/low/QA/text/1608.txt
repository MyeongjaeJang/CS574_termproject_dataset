Philippine Institute of Certified Public Accountants Qatar Chapter (PICPA Doha) celebrated Accountancy Week recently with online quiz bee and a professional development seminar.
The Accountancy Week celebration is an annual tradition in the Philippines which is being observed by accountants in the country since 1966.
PICPA Doha's celebration featured three activities participated by its members and associates. The first activity was an online quiz bee for individual participants wherein accounting related questions were flashed daily on PICPA Doha's official Facebook page.
Another activity was a video advertisement making contest which was aimed at showcasing the talents and skills of members on producing videos that promote and depict the mission, vision and core values of the organisation.
To wrap up the celebration, PICPA Doha organised a seminar on Overview of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Leases at the Holiday Inn Doha. The event was part of the regular programme of the group in compliance with Continuing Professional Development requirements of Professional Regulation Commission, an agency attached to the Philippine Department of Labour and Employment mandated to regulate and supervise the practice of Filipino professionals.
The seminar was conducted by Greggy Bueno. It served as the closing event of the Accountancy Week celebration which also featured the announcement and awarding of winners of the Online Accounting Quiz Bee.
Members of PICPA Doha are looking forward to the organisation's next CPD seminar this month where the winning group in the Video Ad-Making Contest will also be announced. The organisation will communicate the details of the upcoming CPD seminar soon. For more details, contact Alvin Polido at 'a.polido@picpadoha.org'.
