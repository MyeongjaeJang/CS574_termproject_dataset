New YORK: Dropbox Inc's shares soared around 40 percent in their market debut on Friday as investors rushed to buy into the biggest tech IPO in more than a year. The stock opened at $29 on the Nasdaq and shot up to as high as $31 in early trading. At the stock's opening price, the company touched a market valuation of $12.67 billion, above the $10 billion valuation it had in its last private funding round. Dropbox's debut marks an end to a long dry spell in the US IPO market for big names in the technology sector. (Reuters)
