Qatar-based Indian artist and medical officer (doctor) with Qatar Petroleum Dr Sreekumar Padmanabhan recently held an exhibition at the DPS-Modern School at Al Wakrah on ICBF Day 2018.
The event was held by the Indian Community Benevolent Forum - Qatar in association with DPS-Modern Indian School, Doha-Qatar to honour deserving contributors who have dedicated themselves to the betterment of Indians in Qatar. Padmanabhan, who is a self-taught artist, displayed 35 paintings done mostly in the last five years using mediums such as oil paint and acrylic paint.
Speaking about displaying his work at the event he said,"I always find holding an art exhibition a uniquely enriching experience. The opportunity to engage with an audience is an extremely rewarding experience. The dialogue and criticism initiated at such events has always helped me grow as an artist.
"I have done more than a dozen shows, solo as well as group exhibitions in Qatar before, but to exhibit at an event organised by the ICBF, is a great honour and privilege."
Most of his paintings represent human emotions. However, from the response that he received from previous shows he said that he realised that he needed to explore wider subjects."I had started painting horses, falcons and Arabian themes which are much appreciated here," he said.
