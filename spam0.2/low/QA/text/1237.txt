More than 1,000 students, both male and female, graduated at Al Kawthar Multi-Services Center School established by Qatar Charity in Indonesia over the past five years.
Established in 2012, the school now has more than 600 students, more than 200 of whom graduate each year.
After the graduation, many graduates continue their higher education inside and outside the country while others start their career.
Al Kawthar Multi-Service Center, consisting of a school with six classrooms, a mosque, a laboratory hall, a library and a well, provides various development services to benefit thousands of people.
The school provides educations to hundreds of students from inside and outside the city of Banjar.
The centre, built by Qatar Charity, contributes to the improvement of education level and the development of community in the city of Banjar located in Indonesia's West Java province. The centre also plays a significant role in raising the social awareness among students and highlighting the importance of healthy environment for people.
Director of QC's Project Management Khalid al Yafei said the charity set up Al Kawthar School to provide education to as many students as possible in the country, with the aim to achieve the Universal Primary Education, which is one of the UN Millennium Development Goals.
Yafei added that Qatar Charity is seeking to develop Al Kawthar Center and expand its services in the near future, pointing out that the city of Banjar was suffering from poor educational services, which led to the establishment of the school, helping increase the number of students from dozens to more than 600 students.
It is noteworthy that Qatar Charity carried out 786 development projects during 2017 at a cost of QR14.2 million, which benefited hundreds of thousands of people in Indonesia.
