United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an independent investigation into the deaths of 17 Palestinians , who were shot by Israeli forces during Friday's protests in the besieged Gaza Strip . 
More than 1,400 protesters were injured - half of them by Israeli gunfire .
The demonstrators were marking Land Day , which stems from March 30, 1976, when 2,000 hectares of land was confiscated from Palestinian citizens of Israel. Back then, six people died in subsequent protests. 
As the two-state solution peace process crumbles, are frustrations rising?
And can a Jewish majority in Israel be maintained if Palestinian refugees are ever allowed to return to their land?
