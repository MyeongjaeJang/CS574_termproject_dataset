At least 16 Palestinians were killed and more than 1,400 others wounded by Israeli forces as thousands marched near Gaza's border with Israel in a major demonstration marking the 42nd anniversary of Land Day.
Tens of thousands of Palestinians, pressing for a right of return for refugees, gathered at five locations along the fenced 65-km frontier where tents were erected for a planned six-week protest, officials said. The Israeli military estimate was 30,000.
The health ministry in Gaza reported 16 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces throughout the day. More than 1,400 others were also wounded after Israeli forces fired live ammunition at protesters and used tear gas to push them back from a heavily fortified fence.
Israeli security forces also used a drone to fire tear gas toward those along the border from overhead in one of the first uses of the device, a police spokesman said.
Palestinians accused Israel of using disproportionate force, as did Turkey.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared Saturday would be a national day of mourning.
The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on Friday to discuss the situation in Gaza at the request of Kuwait, diplomats said. page 8
