Qatar Red Crescent Society (QRCS) on Tuesday celebrated its 40th anniversary at Cultural Village Foundation (Katara) in the presence of officials, dignitaries, businesspersons and international guests from various related organisations.
QRCS Chairman Dr Mohammed bin Ghanim al Ali al Maadheed welcomed the guests and thanked all those who have participated in the great achievements and success made by QRCS in humanitarian relief inside and outside the country over the past 40 years.
"QRCS has grown considerably over the years with around 8mn people benefited from various key humanitarian and relief services in 2017, with almost 1mn people in Qatar through QRCS health centres that target workers and 7mn around the world in various conflict and disaster-hit areas," he said.
He said QRCS has almost 800 staff members in Qatar and more than 1,000 internationally.
The money spent by QRCS on humanitarian relief efforts to help those in urgent need for key services such as health, education and food amounted to almost $1.5bn recently.
Ibrahim Abdullah al Dhaimi, director-general of QRCS, said that the celebration dates back to a great moment in the founding of the Qatar Red Crescent Society 40 years ago. He also praised the efforts of the founders and employees to build their historic journey to raise the banner of humanitarian action and represent Qatar's bright image in the humanitarian field.
QRCS honoured a number of government officials, donors, volunteers, supporting organisations and companies, in addition to a number of Qatari businessmen for their distinguished contributions throughout the year.
