Brazil's central bank on Wednesday again slashed its interest rate to a new low, this time setting it at 6.5 percent, to try to help boost growth in Latin America's biggest economy.
The cut in the Selic rate of 25 basis points from 6.75 percent, which met analyst expectations, is the 12th consecutive rate reduction, as Brazil tries to emerge from a stifling two-year recession.
At its last meeting in February, when the central bank cut the rate to 6.75 percent, it had said it saw the"interruption of the monetary easing process as more appropriate."
But on Wednesday, it left the door open for another rate cut at its next meeting on May 15-16, saying such a move would be"appropriate."
Brazil returned to economic growth in 2017, with GDP expanding by a meager one percent, but the recovery has been slow and uneven.
The country's inflation rate closed 2017 at 2.95 percent the lowest level in 20 years and in the 12 months to February, the rate stood at 2.84 percent, below the target of three percent.
The central bank's monetary policy committee said Wednesday it"understands that the economic situation prescribes a stimulative monetary policy."
Brazil could see a major political shift by year's end, with the presidential election set for October 7.
Current centre-right leader Michel Temer has faced major opposition to his plans to make deep cuts to the pension system, the keystone of austerity reforms aimed at bringing discipline to the floundering economy.
The measure is popular among investors, but does not have the votes to pass Congress. Many voters fiercely oppose any reductions in the generous system.
