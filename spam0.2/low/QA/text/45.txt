☛ Wearing formals during the hottest season of the year seems like a nightmare but there are several tips and tricks that can be followed to avoid embarrassment at meetings. Try to keep it minimal and avoid wearing everything at one go.
Linen, cotton blends, chambray are the breathable fabrics that one should opt for. Exchange black formal staple with light colours and nudes for a sweat-free summer.
☛ Backpack: Looks small but is spacious! It looks classy and helps keep multifarious gear all in one place.
Shades, protein shaker, diet food and your keys are all sorted. A leather, suede or canvas backpacks are a great option to add an element of style to your look.
☛ Sneakers: We are all crazy about sneakers and these days a pair white sneakers is owned by most men. Introduce more muted tones to your wardrobe and flaunt them with or without socks. It works best for casual affairs.
☛ Prints and patterns: With the rising temperature, increase your dapper quotient by adding prints and patterns to your look. Quirky prints like paisley, floral, checks, stripes, pinstripes, polka dots and pin dots are what this summer season is all about.
☛ Accessories: You can't get thorough summer without a cool pair of sunglasses. They not only work as a shield from virulent sun rays but also add to the person's entire look.
