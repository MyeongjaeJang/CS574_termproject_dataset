QM and UCL Qatar Host Development Workshop for Teachers Posted on Comments 
Qatar Museums (QM) hosted the first of two one-day education workshops, which are aimed at providing school teachers in Qatar with informative and practical sessions on museum education. 
The workshops – for independent, international and private school teachers – form part of QM’s ongoing commitment to align its educational offerings and learning opportunities with teachers’ interests and the school curricula in Qatar. The initial two sessions are pilots, with QM exploring the idea of rolling out the programme in the months to come. 
Teachers participating in this week’s workshop were given the chance to familiarise themselves with the concept of museum education and explore ways in which they can use these concepts and activities in their curriculum. Teachers’ also enjoyed exploring students’ books, lesson plans and online resources, and took part in group exercises related to creating museum educational activities. 
It was run as part of a collaboration between QM and University College London Qatar (UCL Qatar) on museum education. This partnership seeks to significantly contribute to the educational landscape of the State of Qatar, inspiring the next generation of creative talent and thinkers by sharing knowledge about art, heritage and culture. As a result of the workshop, teachers will develop new skills and acquire knowledge of object-based learning, enriching their teaching materials with content coming directly from QM’s collections and exhibitions. 
The next session, organised in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, will take place on 18 April for independent school teachers and will be run by QM educators. Teachers must sign-up in order to secure a place.
