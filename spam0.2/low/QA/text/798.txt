QP Joins Biggest Gathering of Oil and Gas Companies in Oman Posted on Comments Qatar Petroleum joined the largest gathering of oil and gas companies in the Sultanate of Oman this week, at the 11 th Oil and Gas West Asia (OGWA) Exhibition and Conference. The OGWA Exhibition was held under the auspices of the Oman Ministry of Oil and Gas at the Oman Convention and Exhibition Centre in Muscat. QP is joining the event together with Qatar Chemical and Petrochemical Marketing and Distribution Company (Muntajat) , the company which serves as the gateway for Qatar to export chemicals and petrochemical products. The three-day exhibition is also hosting a conference on enhanced oil recovery techniques on the sideline. QPâ€™s participation at OGWA Exhibition comes a few months after the corporation entered into an agreement with Eni of Italy for the exploration and production of Block 52 offshore, Sultanate of Oman. The agreement was signed in November 2017. Qatar and Oman also have close links in the oil and gas industry through the Dolphin Gas Project , which processes up to 2 billion standard cubic feet per day of natural gas from the Qatar North Field. The gas is then transported by pipeline and distributed to customers in the United Arab Emirates and in the Sultanate of Oman.
