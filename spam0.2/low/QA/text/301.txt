Rio DE JANEIRO: Brazil coach Tite has called up uncapped Shakhtar Donetsk left-back Ismaily for international friendlies against Russia and Germany. Ismaily, 28, replaces Juventus defender Alex Sandro, who suffered a thigh injury while training with the Selecao in Moscow, the Brazilian Football Confederation said in a statement on Tuesday. Sandro was only drafted into the Brazil squad last weekend to replace Atletico Madrid's Filipe Luis, who has a broken leg. Brazil will play Russia in Moscow on March 23 followed by a clash with Germany in Berlin four days later.
