QATAR participated in the 13th meeting of the Coordinating Committee of the Global Counterterrorism Forum (GCTF) held in Japanese capital, Tokyo.
Qatari Foreign Minister's Special Envoy on Counterterrorism and Mediation in Disputes' settlements HE Ambassador Dr Mutlaq bin Majed al Qahtani headed the Qatari delegation to the meeting.
Participating delegations discussed ways to strengthen international cooperation in the area of counter-terrorism and ways to operationalise the forum's initiatives.
Qatar expressed its support for the initiatives, stressing the importance of constructive cooperation without politicising the joint efforts.
During the meeting, Qatar presented its point of view on the fight against terrorism and extremism from a regional perspective, stating that most of the root causes of the conflicts related to terrorism and extremism in the Middle East come from sectarian differences, regional rivalry and ongoing conflicts in Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Qatar further stressed that the real war on terror is not the defeat of ISIS in Iraq and Syria militarily but to establish social norms to ensure peaceful coexistence, democracy, equal opportunities and political integration.
Qatar said suffering and injustice pave the way for terrorism to flourish, in addition to the extremist religious doctrines that posed a threat to all.
Qatar referred to the persistence of the evil axes in the region in distorting religious principles to suit their ideology.
Qatar also highlighted the important role played by non-governmental institutions in operationalising the objectives and initiatives of the forum, warning against the exploitation of these institutions by some States of the region for political purposes, thereby weakening their independence and importance in the fight against violent extremism.
