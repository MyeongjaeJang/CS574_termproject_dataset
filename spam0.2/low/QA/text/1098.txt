Hollywood action star Arnold Schwarzenegger is in a stable condition after undergoing emergency open-heart surgery, celebrity news website TMZ reported Friday.
The 70-year-old actor turned activist was in a Los Angeles hospital Thursday to have a catheter valve replaced and developed complications, the gossip portal said.
Doctors rushed the"Terminator" and"Predator" star into theater for open-heart surgery, operating for several hours, TMZ said.
Schwarzenegger, a former Mr Universe, underwent non-urgent heart surgery 21 years ago to have an aortic valve replaced, due to a condition he said was congenital and nothing to do with steroids.
He revealed in his book"Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story" that he initially kept that first operation a secret from his wife, Maria Shriver, by telling her he was on vacation in Mexico.
