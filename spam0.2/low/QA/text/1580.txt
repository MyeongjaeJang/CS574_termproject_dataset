Weekly Podcast: Meet Wellness Coach Anahi Brown Posted on 

Marhaba brings you weekly podcasts by Doha Heat, a communal podcast set up by Ginger Camel Media . 
Doha Heat is for every type of individual who currently calls Qatar home, has in the past, or may one day. The interviews are very relaxed and seek to be honest conversations, like the type you might have with a friend over coffee/tea/karak. 

This week we bring you Wellness Coach Anahi Brown. Anahi brought mega energy into the studio whilst discussing her practise in Qatar, empowering men and women to lead their best lives. She also spoke about Paleo and Keto diets. 
Reach out to Anahi via Facebook and Instagram .
