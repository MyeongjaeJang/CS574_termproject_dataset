Walt Disney International Chairman Andy Bird is set to exit the company after 14 years. He helped in expanding the banner's presence in India.
Bird will leave Disney as part of a restructuring announced last week, though he will stay on through a transition period before exiting, reports hollywoodreporter.com.
Last week, however, CEO Bob Iger unveiled a reorganisation that changes the conglomerate's segments, including the creation of one that includes direct-to-consumer and international, which will be run by Kevin Mayer.
The other segments are parks, experiences and consumer products, headed by Bob Chapek; studio entertainment, still run by Alan Horn; and media networks, still run by Ben Sherwood and James Pitaro.
Disney will also be inheriting a plethora of executive talent many, in fact, with lots of international experience when it closes its purchase of much of the assets of 21st Century Fox, including Star India and its stake in European satellite TV giant Sky.
