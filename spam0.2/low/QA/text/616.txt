The US military command responsible for the Middle East on Sunday dismissed reports that the US Congress may shift the country's airbase from Qatar.
"The US is not leaving Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, nor is the US leaving Al Udeid AB, Qatar. These reports are false and without merit," the US central command said on its official Twitter handle.
The fake reports have been circulating in a section of the media in countries that have been blockading Qatar since June last year.
