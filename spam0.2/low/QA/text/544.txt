Qatar has expressed concern over the report of the UN High Commissioner on the human rights situation in Libya and the continued fighting between Libyan parties as well as the targeting of civilian facilities and the siege imposed on cities.
Qatar reaffirmed its support for the National Reconciliation Government and for all international mediation efforts aimed at ending the crisis and division in Libya, in addition to the full implementation of Skhirat Agreement, which will contribute to enhancing confidence among the Libyan parties, advancing the political and constitutional process, completing the transitional phase, achieving national reconciliation and preserving Libya's unity and sovereignty.
This came in a statement delivered by the Second Secretary of the Permanent Delegation of Qatar to the UN Office in Geneva Abdulla Khalifa al Sowaidi at the 37th session of the Human Rights Council.
Sowaidi expressed Qatar's concern about the continuing impunity for persons accused of human rights violations in Libya. He said that the multiple challenges faced by Libya require all Libyan parties to take responsibility and mobilise efforts to maintain security, extend state sovereignty over all of its territory, protect borders, preserve resources, ensure law enforcement and achieve justice.
Sowaidi added that Qatar is concerned about the situation of migrants mentioned in the report as they are subjected to numerous human rights violations such as arbitrary detention, torture, exploitation, violence and murder. He called on the Libyan government to take measures to address these violations and hold those responsible accountable.
Qatar urged the international community to provide technical assistance and support to the Government of Libya.
