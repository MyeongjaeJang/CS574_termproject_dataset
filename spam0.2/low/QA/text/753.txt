THE successful implementation of the National Health Strategy (NHS) 2018-2022 requires close collaboration across the health sector to ensure that the outcomes are consistent with the three pillars of the strategy: better health, better care and better value, the Minister of Public Health HE Dr Hanan Mohamed al Kuwari.
Kuwari made the remarks at a meeting with 12 leaders of the National Health Strategy who were appointed on Monday to oversee the design of services centred around the seven priority population groups of NHS 2018-2022, and the five priorities identified by the strategy to guide reforms and improvements of health system.
During the meeting, Kuwari noted the important role of the NHS leaders in achieving the ambitious goals set by the new strategy, adding that the leaders' task is to work with medical and support staff throughout the health sector to develop plans to realise the ambitions. She added that their role will be the most prominent in the success of the future, adding that they were selected carefully to have leaders who enjoy respect and appreciation in their profession and with extensive experience in their area of competence.
Kuwari added that the leaders will work together and collaborate to build networks that will drive the coordinated implementation of the strategy across the health sector to achieve the 19 national health goals of the NHS, stressing the importance of working immediately to implement the new strategy.
The seven priority population groups of the NHS, which was launched two days ago, include healthy children and adolescents, health women leading to healthy pregnancies, healthy and safe employees, mental health and wellbeing, improved health for people with multiple chronic conditions, health and wellbeing for people with special needs and healthy aging.
The five strategic goals are integrated model of high-quality care and service delivery, enhanced health promotion and disease prevention, enhanced health protection, health in all policies, and effective system of governance and leadership.
