SOUQ Waqif administration has directed restaurants and cafes which serve 'shisha' to increase its price to a minimum of QR50 from the earlier QR25 in a bid to combat smoking and discourage smokers."The decision was taken a couple of days ago and aims to make the Souq more family-friendly," Souq Waqif's General Manager Mohammed al Salem told Qatar Tribune. He pointed out that it has been observed that the cafes are normally packed with shisha smokers, which prevents families from visiting the Souq along with children. ‚Äù Hisham Aljundi
