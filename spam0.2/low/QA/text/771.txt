Former Grand Slam champions Marin Cilic and Juan Martin del Potro marched ahead on Sunday at the Miami Masters as both produced straight-set wins.
Argentine Del Potro and second seed Cilic from Croatia - US Open winners in 2009 and 2014 respectively - moved easily past the competition at Crandon Park.
Del Potro, the Indian Wells titleholder over Roger Federer, won his 14th straight match as his big game motors on.
The Argentine beat Japan's injury comeback player Kei Nishikori (wrist) while Cilic survived an upset attempt by Canadian Vasek Pospisil to reach the fourth 7-5 7-6 (7-4),~ which took almost two hours.
Cilic managed six aces and saved three break points in the challenging contest.
Pospisil trailed 5-6 0-40 in the second set, and rose to his best to save three match points before Cilic was finally able to escape in the tiebreaker for the win. Cilic is now a title tip with the absence of Federer and will be looking for an 18th career trophy.
Korean Chung Hyeon spent just over an hour in his defeat of qualifier Michael Mmoh 6-1 6-1.~
Chung, 23rd, has yet to drop a set at the event.
Serb Filip Krajinovic earned a victory, defeating Frenchman Benoit Paire 6-3, 6-3 while Portugal's Joao Sousa advanced past Jared Donaldson 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 in a comeback effort.
With the unexpected exit of Federer in a second-round Saturday shock, much of the oxygen drained out of the last edition of the tournament, being played for the final time at the Key Biscayne venue before a move to an NFL football facility from 2019.
