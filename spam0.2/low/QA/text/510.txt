US President Donald Trump late Friday rolled back his blanket ban on transgender people serving in the military but they will still face major restrictions in the American armed forces.
Trump signed a memorandum in August that effectively barred transgender people from the military but the ban faced multiple legal challenges.
The White House has now come back with a modified version of the original plan as with Trump's efforts to ban travelers from several Muslim-majority countries, which was repeatedly challenged in court.
"I hereby revoke my memorandum of August 25, 2017, 'Military Service by Transgender Individuals,'and any other directive I may have made with respect to military service by transgender individuals,"Trump's new memorandum said. Trump instead sought to shift responsibility to two of his cabinet secretaries.
"The Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, with respect to the US Coast Guard, may exercise their authority to implement any appropriate policies concerning military service by transgender individuals,"the memorandum said.
Trump's memorandum said the two cabinet secretaries recommended people diagnosed with gender dysphoria be barred from military service.
"Transgender persons who have not transitioned to another gender and do not have a history or current diagnosis of gender dysphoria... are eligible for service"if they meet mental and physical health standards and"are capable of adhering to the standards associated with their biological sex,"the report said.
