The sixth edition of Qatar International Agricultural Exhibition (AgriteQ 2018) that opened on March 20 at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Centre (DECC) saw the participation of nearly 313 exhibitors from at least 36 countries.
This was the first time that Portugal was represented at AgriteQ through five Portuguese companies: Artevasi (plastic vases), Cerealis (cereals, pasta and biscuits), Chocolataria Equador (exquisite chocolates), Novarroz (rice) and Queijos Tavares (cheese).
Portuguese Ambassador to Qatar HE Ant'f3nio T'e2nger visited the stalls of the Portuguese companies to support them and talk about the potential of the Qatari market."The Embassy has been pushing the best companies from Portugal to participate at exhibitions in Qatar, to provide an opportunity to them to showcase, and introduce to Qatar their best products that are known for their quality around the world.
Artevasi has been in the market for several years. They sell vases for the most known flowers shops in town. Cerealis and Queijos Tavares export all over the world, including to Middle Eastern countries. During the exhibition, they all established interesting contacts for future investment.
Chocolataria Equador, which recently opened its first shop in The Pearl-Qatar (Porto Arabia, Tower 25), is getting a good response from people. Novarroz, has some of the best rice in Portugal and can also now be found in Qatar."It is very good to see people appreciating Portuguese products as well as recognise the excellent quality, not only in food, but also in other areas, like the ones we have at AgriteQ, Project Qatar, Heya and Foodex. Portugal is very keen on supporting Qatar and bringing more companies that could enrich the market with Portuguese flavours, technology and style," said the Ambassador.
