MUMBAI The world's richest cricket board is poised to get even wealthier after media rights to Indian cricket for the next five years brought spirited bidding on Tuesday.
The e-auction of television and digital rights, a first in cricket, was not concluded but the Indian board (BCCI) received a bid of 44.4 billion Indian rupees ($683 million) for consolidated global rights from an unidentified bidder.
"The online auction will now resume on Wednesday...from the same stage,"the BCCI said in a statement.
Star India paid 38.5 billion rupees for the rights to broadcast India's home matches for the 2012-2018 cycle.
