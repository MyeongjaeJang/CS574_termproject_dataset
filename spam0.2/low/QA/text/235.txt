The Ministry of Administrative Development, Labor and Social Affairs has announced 3,798 job vacancies in the country.
Out of 3,798 job vacancies, 3,337 are in the government sector and 461 in the private sector.
The job seekers who have registered with the ministry can apply for all the vacancies from Thursday, Minister of Administrative Development, Labor and Social Affairs HE Dr Issa bin Saad al Jafali al Nuaimi said on Wednesday.
The job seekers will be given the opportunity to view all vacancies in both the sectors with full transparency so that they can apply for suitable posts that match their qualifications. They will then be nominated to the companies to complete the employment procedures, he added.
Nuaimi said the ministry will only nominate the job seekers after confirming that they meet the criteria. After they succeed in the interview conducted by the company, the ministry will then follow up with the employment process, he added. An assessment will be made on determining the number of Qataris working in the private sector.
He said the ministry has prepared a plan for nationalisation of jobs. The department of national human resources development, which is in charge of the nomination of Qatari job seekers in both public and private sectors, has identified the needs of government agencies and some private sector during the last period.
By April 1, the job seekers will be able to log on to the specified website and enter the data to be able to choose three companies, he added.
