The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) will launch the National Health Strategy 2018-2022 in conjunction with the official launch of the Middle East Health Quality and Safety Forum at Qatar National Convention Center (QNCC) on Saturday.
The vision of the strategy 'Our Health Our Future' is to improve the health of Qatar's population, meet the needs of present and future generations and provide an integrated system aimed at improving health, better health care and better value for all.
The strategy identifies seven priority population groups - healthy children and adolescents, healthy women leading to healthy pregnancies, healthy and safe employees, mental health and well-being, improved health for people with multiple chronic conditions, health and well-being for people with special needs, and healthy ageing.
The strategy also identifies priorities at the health system level to guide and manage actions in the health sector over the coming years, which reflect the health needs of Qatar, and take into account internationally agreed healthcare priorities and best practices.
