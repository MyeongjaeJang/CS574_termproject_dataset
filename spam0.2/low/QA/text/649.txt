THE Embassy of Bangladesh in Doha observed the 'Genocide Day' with due solemnity on Sunday.
The programme started with recitation from the Holy Quran in presence of the embassy officials and a large number of Bangladeshi expatriates.
They stood in solemn silence for one minute to pay respect to the martyrs of the 'Liberation War'. The messages from the president and prime minister of Bangladesh were read out. A discussion meeting was organised to highlight the significance of the day.
In his speech, Bangladesh's Ambassador HE Ashud Ahmed recalled the atrocities carried out by the Pakistani Army on the dark night of March 25, 1971. To resist this brutal killing of innocent Bengalis by Pakistan Army, a guerrilla resistance movement of valiant freedom fighters 'Mukt Bahini' was formed. The ambassador also recalled the epic role played by Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the freedom fighters in the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent country.
"Our duty now is to work for building the country in such a way that Bangladesh and Bengalis can achieve global esteem and respect. March 25 is declared as 'Genocide Day' in Bangladesh and we are in the process of achieving global recognition to observe this day as 'International Genocide Day'. The Bangladesh missions abroad will also play their active role in seeking support of the host governments with a view to facilitate recognition of the day by the United Nations," the ambassador said.
Prior to the discussion meeting, an audio visual documentary on 'Genocide Day' was also screened and special prayer was offered seeking salvation of the souls of martyrs of 'Liberation War'.
