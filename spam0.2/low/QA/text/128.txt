US efforts to conduct offensive and defensive operations in cyberspace are falling short, a top general warned Tuesday amid ongoing revelations about Russian hacking.
General John Hyten, who leads US Strategic Command (STRATCOM), told lawmakers the US has"not gone nearly far enough"in the cyber domain, also noting that the military still lacks clear rules of cyber engagement.
"We have to go much further in treating cyberspace as an operational domain,"Hyten told the Senate Armed Services Committee."Cyberspace needs to be looked at as a warfighting domain, and if somebody threatens us in cyberspace we need to have the authorities to respond."Hyten noted, however, that the US had made some progress in conducting cyber attacks on enemies in the Middle East, such as the Islamic State group.
His testimony comes weeks after General Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of NATO forces in Europe, warned that US government agencies are not coordinating efforts to counter the cyber threat from Russia, even as Moscow conducts a"campaign of destabilization."Hyten added the military needs clear authorities and rules of engagement so operators know when and how to respond to attacks.
