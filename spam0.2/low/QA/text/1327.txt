MINISTRY of Administrative Development, Labour and Social Affairs (MoADLSA) said it has received scores of job seeking citizens of different education levels, pointing that the number of candidates on the first day was 928 job seekers, nominated for 2,065 jobs.
The Ministry explained in a press statement on the turnout on the first day of activating the electronic nominating system filtering for jobs in the government and private sectors, that job seekers only need to enter the website of the Ministry of Administrative Development, Labour and Social Affairs and choose the link of the system of nomination for jobs, then key-in the ID number and phone number, and finally key-in the passcode received by text message.
The Ministry added that the system allows a job seeker to view the available openings in different institutions and select up to three job opportunities. The job seeker will then receive a text message confirming that they have completed registration.
The statement added that that owing to some of the observations received on the first day from job seekers, which requires applying some adjustments, the system has been put on hold to add the required updates and raise its efficiency so that users can view all open vacancies and select the suitable jobs according to their qualifications.
The Ministry further said that the system will be resumed on Monday morning. (QNA)
