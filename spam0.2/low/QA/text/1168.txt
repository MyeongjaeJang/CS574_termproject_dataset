The Society of Fire Protection Engineers (SFPE) Qatar chapter conducted a technical seminar titled 'Commissioning Process for Fire Protection Systems' recently. The seminar was part of its educational seminars and workshops held in the course of the year to advance the science and practise of fire protection engineering and its allied fields.
The seminar attracted more than 160 participants members and non-members from the fire protection industry comprising consultants, fire contractors, fire protection specialists and other allied professionals.
SFPE Qatar Chapter President and Board Chairman Edgar Boyano welcomed the speakers and participants of the day-long seminar. He stressed that SFPE seminars do not just aim to update professionals on the latest information and innovations in the field but also aim to foster high ethical standards among members. He thanked Firelink, Qatar Factory, Thompson Specialties Middle East and Cesco for making the seminar possible.
Arnold Ventanilla from Thompson Specialties, one of the technical speakers, said,"The reason we are here is because we would like to improve our service, become more competitive in the market and be able to save more lives. Without proper knowledge, there will be no proper execution. Without proper execution, we won't be able to save as many lives as we could."
A Q&A was conducted after each technical presentation. Plaques of appreciation were given to each technical speaker and the seminar concluded with a distribution of certificates.
SFPE Qatar chapter offers members the resources they need to excel in their careers, stay on top of the latest industry developments, and offer networking opportunities by connecting with the best minds in fire protection and fire safety engineering industry.
