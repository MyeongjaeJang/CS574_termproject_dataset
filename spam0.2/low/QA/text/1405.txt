An International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) delegation had a two-day tour of the Aspire Dome, which will host the 48th FIG Artistic World Championships in October.
The FIG officials were in the city to oversee the preparation for the Worlds, which will be hosted in the region for the first time.
The delegates were taken on a guided tour by the Qatar Gymnastics Federation's (QGF) top officials, including President Ali Ahmed al Hitmi, who is also the Chairman of the 2018 World Championships Tournament Committee.
The FIG delegation included director of men's artistic gymnastics Celine Cachemaille, director of women artistic gymnastics Terhi Toivanen, and director of television broadcasting, communications and marketing Olivier Strebel.
The officials inspected the competitions halls, training areas, changing rooms besides other important locations inside the venue, which recently hosted the 11th FIG Artistic Individual Apparatus World Cup as a test event.
"It was a general inspection tour that is mandatory before any top international tournaments. Doha is ready to host the Worlds and look forward to receiving the world and Olympic champions," Hitmi said.
The QGF head also added the visiting delegates heaped praise on Qatar's passion for sports and excellent infrastructure.
In fact, the annual event's success coupled with excellent facilities and organisational experience in hosting international sports competition helped Doha bagged the tournament rights in 2013.
The delegates later had a discussion with the QGF and Organising Committee members Abeer al Buainain, Mohammed al Maraghi, Mohammed al Missned, Maryam al Mahmoud and Anis Saoud.
