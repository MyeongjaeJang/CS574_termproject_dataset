In a sport where so much can go wrong, the sheer consistency of alpine skiing World Cup champions Mikaela Shiffrin and Marcel Hirscher proves how impressive they are on the slopes and how big a gap there is to the rest.
High winds in Are, Sweden led to the cancellation of Sunday's men's slalom, the final race of the World Cup season, and in turn robbed Hirscher of the chance to become the first man to win a record 14 races in a season and a record eighth slalom victory in one campaign.
The seven-times overall champion just seems to get better and better with the drive to win titles very much still there despite all his previous success.
"It is something where I personally thought with just two disciplines it was not possible to reach this mark," the Austrian told reporters.
"It is crazy, with this broken ankle. I thought,'Ok is it a career-ending injury? No. But is the season gone? Maybe'. The crystal globe? No chance'. It is unbelievable."
He joins Sweden's Ingemar Stenmark (1978/79) and Austria's Hermann Maier (2000/01) on 13 wins in a season.
He took victory in Pyeongchang in the combined and the giant slalom but his big regret will be missing out on slalom gold after skiing out in the first leg of his pet event.
It was a similar story for American Shiffrin, who only finished fourth in her slalom speciality in South Korea but did pick up gold in the giant slalom.
The 23-year-old captured her second straight overall World Cup title earlier this month in Ofterschwang, Germany and looks like she can dominate for as long as Hirscher, if not longer.
"It's always difficult, there are always so many challenges during the season, and throughout the year all the girls kept picking up the pace," Shiffrin said after winning her seventh slalom of the season at Are on Saturday.
