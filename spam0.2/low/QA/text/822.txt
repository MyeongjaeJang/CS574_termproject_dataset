Qatar has seen a 17 percent increase in the number of new factories since the unjust siege was imposed on Doha, Minister of Energy and Industry HE Dr Mohammed bin Saleh al Sada has said.
"This (the number of factories) will again increase to 20 percent in the next two months," Sada said on the sidelines of the event held to inaugurate the expansion of a Qatar International Cables Company (QICC) plant on Tuesday.
The minister attributed this robust growth to the involvement of the private sector in the development process.
"The private sector accelerated the opening and setting up of new factories to cater to the local markets," Sada said, adding that the public and the private sector worked hard to get these amazing outcomes.
Reaffirming the government's continued support to the private sector, Sada said,"The doors are open to the private sector to communicate with the state bodies, expecting further expansion of the industrial base at this rapid pace in Qatar."
He said the expansion of the QICC plant is important as it provides the country with the cables it needs, which plays a crucial role in supporting the development process.
Sada expressed satisfaction and pride at seeing QICC, a national company, investing in the local market to supply the country's electricity sector with high quality cables to serve Qatar's development and strategic projects.
He stressed that Qatar would provide all support to the private sector, especially in the industrial field.
Meanwhile, QICC celebrated the completion of the second phase of the expansion of its plant in Mesaieed Industrial City, 10 years after the company was established.
The company's products includes low-medium-and high-voltage power cables, control cables and others.
