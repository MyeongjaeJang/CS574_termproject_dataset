Gaetano Micciche has been voted in as the new president of the Lega Serie A after the post was held by two temporary commissioners, the governing body of Italian football's top flight said Monday.
The 20 Serie A clubs elected Micciche unanimously to the post filled since last March by Carlo Tavecchio and Giovanni Malago.
Tavecchio is the former president of the Italian football federation (FIGC), who resigned in November.
Malago, who heads Italy's Olympic committee (CONI), took over from Tavecchio as the clubs failed to agree on a candidate for a second time.~Malago is to remain in charge until a new board is elected.
Micciche is the president of the investment bank Banca IMI. He was awarded the Order of Merit for Labour of the Italian Republic in 2013.
