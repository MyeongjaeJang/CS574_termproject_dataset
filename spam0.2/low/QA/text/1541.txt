Barcelona: Betis beat Getafe 1-0 with a goal in the last minute on Monday to move into one of the European places in La Liga. Betis go sixth, above local rivals Sevilla, in the table.~But the last few minutes were marked by drama and controversy. First Sergio Leon scored from Antonio Barragan's cross on 89 minutes. But Getafe then believed they had equalized. Leandro Cabrera headed on to the inside of the post and the ball appeared to cross the line before Betis keeper Antonio Adan hooked it out and back into play.
Referee Alberto Undiano ruled that~the ball had not crossed the line and waved play on.
"The important thing for us is to be in that top six or seven teams," a jubilant Leon said.
Getafe's Jorge Molina said:"We did not deserve to lose. They had more of the ball but we had our chances."
