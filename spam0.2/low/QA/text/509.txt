Doha An uninterrupted supply of local vegetables at reasonably low prices has come as a huge relief to wholesale vegetable dealers in Qatar. The dealers had signed long-term contracts for supplying vegetables to retailers, restaurants and hotel chains at fixed prices. The unjust blockade imposed on Qatar by some neighbours in June last year had impacted the vegetable dealers for a short period as they incurred losses supplying vegetables to their clients at the fixed prices. In the immediate aftermath of the siege, prices of some of the vegetables imported from the siege countries had shot up. But the situation returned to normal soon. Santhosh Chandran
