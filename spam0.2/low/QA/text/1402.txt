The seventh conference of the International Association of Police Academies and Colleges (INTERPA) kicked off on Monday in the presence of Prime Minister and Minister of Interior HE Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa al Thani, who is also Chairman of the Supreme Council of Police College.
Speaking at the opening session of the three-day conference titled"New Trends in Combating Terrorism and Extremism", National Counter-terrorism Committee Chairman Maj Gen Abdulaziz Abdullah al Ansari said,"Qatar is firmly dealing with the phenomenon of terrorism by enacting legislations to tackle it and enhance the country's international cooperation in this direction."
He said,"Qatar has always affirmed its rejection of all acts of extremism and terrorism in all forms and manifestations, and expressed its support for all legal measures aimed at eliminating extremism and terrorism."
Ansari said,"Qatar has also acceded to several conventions on terrorism at the regional and international levels and concluded bilateral agreements with friendly countries," he noted.
Ansari also referred to Qatar's cooperation with the counter-terrorism committees established in line with the UN Security Council resolutions as well as its constant efforts to exchange information, expertise and technical assistance in the field of security and to implement international and regional resolutions and strategies related to combating extremism and terrorism.
He said that extremism couldn't be linked to a nationality, identity or religion, while rejecting attempts to associate terrorism with Islam. He said there are social, economic, political and security factors that contribute to the upsurge of extremism.
He said lack of security in a country, lack of basic needs, multiplicity of religious and ethnic identities, family disintegration, the policy of marginalisation, and the absence of community integration programmes all contribute to development of a breeding ground for terrorism, in addition to personal factors apart from ideologies.
