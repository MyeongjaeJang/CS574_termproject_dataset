THE Public Works Authority (Ashghal) has opened a new bridge over Al Shamal road directly connecting Al Itihad Street in Al Gharrafa Area and Saqr Street in Madinat Khalifa North.
Ashghal succeeded in opening the bridge to traffic six months ahead of the schedule. The design and construction of such a bridge usually takes a full year, Ashghal said in a press statement.
Ashghal's success is the result of the engineering solution that was used to build the bridge, which minimised the construction time. Moreover, this engineering solution also significantly shortened the amount and duration of traffic diversions.
The bridge will also help reduce traffic diversions which are needed for the construction works which will be implemented in the area and reduce its impact on traffic.
The advanced technology used for the construction is known as the Post Tensioning System, where a number of thick steel cables are placed inside the bars before pouring the concrete.
It is worth mentioning that the bridge was constructed using materials from national factories in Qatar as part of Ashghal's efforts to support and qualify the Qatari product, factories and local suppliers.
The new bridge consists of one lane in each direction and directly connects the two areas of Gharafa and Madinat Khalifa North. It will eventually reduce traffic on Al Shamal Road and ease traffic congestion on Umm Lekhba Interchange (Landmark) and Al Gharrafa Interchange (Al Jawazat). (TNN)
