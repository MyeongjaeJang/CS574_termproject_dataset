TV actor Vikram Sharma is set to make his Hindi film debut with a yet-to-be-titled horror film.
Vikram can be currently seen as Balwinder Singh in Discovery Jeet's '21 Sarfarosh: Saragarhi 1897'.
The film is directed and produced by Ajay Yadav.
"It's like a dream come true. Every actor's wish is to grow and want to be a part or Bollywood. I have done many roles in past which helped me. All the roles that I have played till date had a certain get-up be it Hanuman or now as Balwinder Singh in '21 Sarfarosh: Saragarhi 1897'," said Vikram.
"For the first time I can be me and show myself to the audience and it feels good to look great and its a nice feeling altogether. It is just the start, it's a new story and is different. I had put all my hard work in it and my martial arts' training has helped me a lot in the fight sequences. I did all my action sequences myself without a body double," added Vikram.
On the small screen, Vikram has worked in projects like 'Ramayan', 'Sankat Mochan Mahabali Hanuman', 'Razia Sultan' and 'Ganga'.
