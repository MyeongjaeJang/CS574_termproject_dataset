AIMING to promote agriculture among the society, the Waste Treatment Department of Ministry of Municipality and Environment (MME) will distribute high quality compost processed from 'green wastes' free of cost.
Individual agriculturalists who provide their personal information and crop details at the MME pavilion at AgriteQ 2018 can collect up to 25 bags (10 kg in each bag) of compost from the department's hangar on Old Airport Road. A total of 10,000 bags of compost have been earmarked for distribution to individual agriculturalists.
General Consultant at Waste Treatment Department Daniel R Hermandez Ochoa told Qatar Tribune,"This is an effort to promote agriculture among individuals with the target of meeting the local requirement of vegetables and other organic food. The MME will also distribute similar or higher quantity of compost to small and mid-scale farmers."
Expansion of agricultural sector in Qatar after the beginning of the blockade has generated huge demand for natural fertilisers. The highly-equipped recycling unit of MME has the capacity to segregate 100,000 tonnes of waste every day.
"At present, MME is recycling 100 tonnes of waste everyday which includes domestic, green and mixed wastes. While the compost produced out of green wastes is distributed to the public, the compost produced from domestic wastes is being used for MME's internal purposes such as public gardens," Ochoa said.
Aside from compost, the MME also produces multi-purpose materials that can substitute flooring tiles, wooden wall panels and several other materials for furniture.
Ochoa said the MME is planning to open more outlets in the country to distribute compost to agricultural enthusiasts at a nominal price which is to meet the logistical expenses.
"MME's recycling unit also offers business and investment opportunities. We offer technology free of cost to businesses," Ochoa added.
