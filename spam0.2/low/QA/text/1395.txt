HAMAD Bin Khalifa University's (HBKU) College of Law and Public Policy (CLPP) is hosting a public lecture on Climate Change and Energy Transitions in Qatar at HBKU's College of Islamic Studies Building in Education City on April 4.
The lecture will feature Abdelhadi Nasser Almarri, director of the Climate Change Department at the Ministry of Municipality and Environment, as a speaker to discuss Qatar's prioritisation of climate change mitigation and action points as outlined in its national strategic vision. Almarri will examine Qatar's responses to the challenges posed by climate change and its current policies that will spearhead its low carbon energy transition.
Commenting on the lecture, Professor Clinton Francis, founding dean of CLPP, said:"Like all other nations of the world, Qatar too is confronted with challenges of energy and resource management, and is actively seeking solutions for sustainable, low-carbon energy resources. Our upcoming lecture provides our students and members of our broader community a unique opportunity to hear first-hand from officials on the many steps the government is taking to mitigate climate change."
Chairing the lecture will be Dr Damilola S Olawuyi, associate professor of energy and environmental law at CLPP, who, along with Almarri, will take questions and address comments from attendees throughout the session. In addition to interested members of the public, expected attendees will comprise industry and policy experts, students and staff, who will have the opportunity to engage in networking and share professional feedback after the lecture.
The lecture follows a series of CLPP events on environment and energy transitions in Qatar, most notably the 2017 Energy Transitions Conference which took place last November, underscoring HBKU's commitment to lead and facilitate topics that address environmental challenges in the country and create a tangible and positive impact on the community.
As part of CLPP's commitment to tackling multidisciplinary policy challenges facing Qatar and the region, the college continues to host lectures, conferences and other events to facilitate mutual dialogue between industry and academia that elicit thought-provoking debate and promote innovative solutions.
