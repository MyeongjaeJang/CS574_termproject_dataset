Qatar Petroleum (QP) has selected Chiyoda Corporation of Japan to execute the Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) of the onshore facilities of the North Field Expansion, an official statement said on Monday.
The facilities will produce an additional 23 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG, which will raise Qatar's production from 77 to 100 mtpa, as announced by Qatar Petroleum last July.
"The award of the Front End Engineering and Design contract to Chiyoda Corporation is a significant milestone in our journey to deliver the first LNG from this new project by the end of 2023," QP President & CEO Saad Sherida al Kaabi said.
The addition of 23 mtpa of LNG will not just enhance Qatar Petroleum's position as the world's largest LNG producer and exporter, but also its international image as a reliable and trustworthy energy provider, he added.
"The expansion of Qatar's LNG production from the North Field is an important landmark in Qatar Petroleum's strategic growth plan and objectives of becoming one of the best national oil and gas companies in the world.
"We are continuing discussions with potential international joint venture partners for this strategic project to determine an optimised arrangement with the objective of delivering maximum value to Qatar and contribute to the optimal utilisation of Qatar's natural resources."
