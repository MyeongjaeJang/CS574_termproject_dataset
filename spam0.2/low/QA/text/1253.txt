Embattled Australia vowed to spearhead a new era of"respect and sportsmanship"after the ball-tampering scandal which sent shockwaves through the sport.
After a week in which captain Steve Smith, his deputy David Warner and young batsman Cameron Bancroft were banned and sent home in disgrace, Australia returned to action on Friday in the fourth and final Test against South Africa.
In a gesture of reconciliation, the Australian and South African teams lined up before the start of play at the Wanderers and shook hands with each other.
"Cricket's a gentleman's game. I spoke to our players about bringing it in. It's not something we'll do every Test match but I think it's not a bad way to start a Test series,"explained Australian captain Tim Paine who suggested the pre-match handshake.
"I think it's just a good show of sportsmanship and respect."
The 33-year-old added:"There's been a lot of water under the bridge and a bit of tension between the two sides. We want to be super-competitive but we also want to respect the opposition and it was important to show that today."
Coach Darren Lehmann, who will stand down after the match despite being cleared of any involvement in the scandal, gathered his shell-shocked team in a huddle before action began on Friday, but admitted it was hard to concentrate.
"We're not a hundred percent mentally right but we're representing our country and we've got to get the ball rolling by playing the best cricket we possibly can,"Lehmann said.
Despite the cordiality on the Wanderers pitch, some fans in a series-best crowd of 17,023 could not resist poking fun at the Australians'attempts to doctor the ball with sandpaper in the third Test in Cape Town last weekend.
