AYSE and Ece Ege, the founders of luxury fashion brand Dice Kayek, will be giving Crossing Boundaries lectures at the Fire Station: Artist in Residence and Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts in Qatar (VCUarts Qatar).
The lectures, titled, 'Istanbul Contrast: Defining a City Through Fashion', will take place on April 2 at 7pm at the Fire Station Cinema; and again, on April 3 at 1pm at VCUarts Qatar's Atrium. Both lectures are free and open to the public.
Dice Kayek was launched in 1992 by sisters Ece and Ayse Ege and over the past two decades has built a reputation for its carefully curated universe, one in which tradition combines with modernity, film, art and personal memories to inform its designs which are inspired by using architectural lines to build strong, structural silhouettes.
A modern take on couture, creativity, detail and craftsmanship underpins the Turkish heritage brand, which is based in Paris and became part of the Federation Francaise de la Couture in 1994. Since then, the brand has received industry-wide recognition, becoming the recipient of numerous accolades and awards and the subject of various cultural and fashion exhibitions.
After almost two decades since Ayse and Ece Ege founded Dice Kayek, they felt the urge to go beyond the temporality of fashion and look deeper into their primal source of fascination: Istanbul, an indefinable city belonging neither to the West nor to the East, blending the wisdom of traditions and a flair for modernity. Characterised by its magically coexisting contrasts, they were wondering how they could translate Istanbul's rich architectural, cultural and religious diversity into couture.
In 2013, Dice Kayek won the Jameel Prize 3, an international award for contemporary art and design inspired by Islamic traditions, for its Istanbul Contrast exhibition, which was hosted by the Victoria & Albert Museum.
