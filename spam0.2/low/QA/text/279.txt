Three-time Academy Award winner Steven Spielberg says he doesn't consider himself a legend but just a"movie director".
The 71-year-old filmmaker, who helmed a number of iconic movies like"Jurassic Park" and"Indiana Jones" franchises, was awarded the Empire Legend of Our Lifetime at the Rakuten TV Empire Awards 2018 but admitted he just"feels like a movie director", reports femalefirst.co.uk.
"They call me a legend but I don't feel like that way but I am happy to accept the award in the name of that word. I just feel like a movie director than a legend," he said at the event here.
