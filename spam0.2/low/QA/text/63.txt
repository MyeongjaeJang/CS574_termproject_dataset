At the invitation of HE the Speaker of the Advisory Council, the session was attended by Minister of Economy and Commerce HE Sheikh Ahmed bin Jassim bin Mohammed al Thani to discuss the economic and trade policies and assure citizens of the sustained economic stability and future prospects in light of the unjust siege imposed on the country.
Mahmoud praised the economic and commercial policies of the State, which the Emir HH Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani laid down its foundations and outlined its frameworks that enabled the country to overcome the effects of the siege since its inception, move towards a new stage of self-reliance and high levels of production and diversification of sources of income, and establish major projects of which some have been already implemented and others are being implemented in an effective and professional manner.
Mahmoud welcomed the minister, expressing his thanks for accepting the invitation and attending the session, which saw extensive discussions on the State's economic and trade policies and the current and future plans and programmes of the Ministry of Economy and Commerce (MEC).
The discussions included the situation of the Qatari economy after more than nine months of the unjust siege imposed on the country; the economic policies adopted by the State and its success in facing the siege, containing and overcoming its negative effects, and economic plans and policies for the post-siege phase; the State strategy to diversify sources of income and develop the productivity of non-oil sectors; the State policies towards supporting the private sector in implementation of HH the Emir's directives, and the foundations under which this support is granted and the extent of success achieved in this important area; Qatari exports, foreign trade, Qatar's new markets, Qatari national product competitiveness, and national product initiative.
The discussions also included the flow of imports through State ports, the availability of basic consumer goods in the market, the efforts of the MEC to stabilise prices and make them affordable for all and eliminate the phenomenon of disparities in commodity prices; and opening of new channels with brotherly and friendly countries to accelerate the supply of goods and products to the local market, while diversifying their geographic distribution and geopolitical extension.
They further included the size of the gross domestic product (GDP), the growth rate and surplus achieved by the country's trade balance; the volume of investments in various productive and service sectors and the extent of success in attracting foreign investments, and the effectiveness of the laws in force in encouraging and securing investment, providing environment and climate conducive to increase it and stimulate investors, and the expected positive effects of the draft non-Qatari capital investment law; and providing important investment opportunities not only in food security but also in the logistics, sports, tourism, health and other vital sectors, along with the State's efforts to increase foreign investment flows to the Qatari market; and launching a package of incentives for landholders in the logistics areas to reduce production costs and reduce rental prices.
They highlighted that the contribution of non-oil sectors to GDP reached 52% in 2017; foreign trade increased by 16% in 2017; exports increased by 19% to $68 billion in 2017 compared to $57 billion in 2016; the country's trade balance achieved a surplus of 40% in 2017; Qatar's GDP increased to $220 billion in 2017 compared with $218 billion in 2016, or 2% at constant prices; the World Bank expects our national economy to grow by 2.6% in 2018; and Qatar's occupied advanced international positions in the economic and commercial indicators.
