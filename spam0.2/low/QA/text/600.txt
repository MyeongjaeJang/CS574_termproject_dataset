WASHINGTON
Vot er registration activists fanned out among throngs of young Americans who marched for tighter gun laws on Saturday, signing up thousands of first-time voters who want to eject lawmakers who oppose gun control.
With mid-term Congressional elections eight months away, the activists flocked to some 800 marches across the country to register young voters likely to back Democratic and independent candidates who tend to favor tougher firearms laws.
In Washington, volunteers for HeadCount voterregistration effort raised their fists and chanted “demonstration without registration leads to frustration” before heading out with clipboards to sign up some of the nation’s newest voters.
Organisers of the voter registration drive hoped to sign up at least 25,000 people, a potential boost for Democrats who back stronger controls on assault-style weapons, bump stocks that let semiautomatic rifles fire like automatic weapons, and tighter access to guns for young people and the mentally ill.
At a rally in Chicago, 17- year old Kara Sharp from Illinois, carried a sign reading “Protect students not guns - 2020 Voter” after traveling to the event with her father, a 53-year-old machinist.
Volunteers from a local chapter of lobbying group Indivisible435, which backs progressive political candidates, told her how to register to vote once she got home, as she did not have her driving license with her.
“It’s time to disarm hate. I’ll be looking at NRA ratings of politicians and also how they treat LGBQ issues,” said Sharp, a junior at Wauconda High School, referring to the grade the National Rife Association gives members of Congress for their voting record on gun rights.
Registration activists are targeting four million Americans turning 18 this year, as well as many 19- to 21-yearolds who have never voted.
