New York: Online retailing behemoth Amazon.com Inc has cut ties with Washington lobbying firms Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP and Squire Patton Boggs, Bloomberg reported on Friday. The changes took place about a week before US President Donald Trump accused Amazon in a tweet on Thursday of not paying enough tax, taking advantage of the US postal system and putting small retailers out of business. Amazon had cut ties from the lobbying firms last Friday and in their place hired Paul Brathwaite of Federal Street Strategies LLC and Josh Holly of Holly Strategies Inc. (Reuters)
