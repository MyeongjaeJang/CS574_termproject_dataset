Movenpick Hotel Doha Hosts Food Tasting Event Celebrating Brand’s 70 Years of Culinary Innovation Posted on Comments 
The ’70 years of culinary excellence’ promotion, available in Seasons restaurant at Movenpick Hotel Doha for lunch and dinner from 10 March to 20 April 2018, is a campaign initiated for restaurants at all Movenpick properties globally. It includes seven reimagined dishes that marry the old with the new – popular classics and guest favourites reinterpreted for the modern palate, inspired by cuisines and gastronomy trends from around the world. 
On 20 March, Movenpick Hotel Doha invited media influencers, journalists and food bloggers in order to commemorate this great company’s initiative. Some of the key highlights of the event were a brief presentation on the history of Movenpick Hotels & Resorts, tasting of the dishes, and sharing of opinions and feedback about the dishes. The invitees also had a special interaction with the chef, where he gave more depth about the special menu and their uniqueness. 
The special menu includes scallops & avocado tartare , which is a reinvention of Mövenpick’s popular beef tartare influenced by Mediterranean cuisine; salade belle fermière , a lively interpretation of Salade François, made famous in the 1948 American musical, ‘Easter Parade’; mille feuille saumon & caviar d’olive , a savoury take combining delicately smoked salmon, puff pastry and golden olive caviar; mushrooms and vegetables Zurich style , a meat-free version of Zurich-style veal that pairs aromatic root vegetables and smoky shiitake mushrooms; seafood Casimir , a medley of steamed seafood, fish and salicornia (sea asparagus), and an assortment of citrus fillets, paired with wild rice; bare beef burger Café de Paris , a prime beef cut paired with crispy ultra-thin parmesan-dusted fries; and carrot waffle , a quirky reinterpretation of the classic Swiss carrot cake. 
Sami Aawar, General Manager, Movenpick Hotel Doha, said: 
We are very happy to have shared these delightful dishes in our event as we wanted our guests to experience a taste of our Swiss hospitality and also showcase how we stand true to our founder – Ueli Prager’s vision of doing normal things in an extraordinary manner,’
