QATAR has bettered its rank to 55 from the previous 66 on the latest edition of the Global Human Capital Index, officials have said.
This was revealed during a symposium on the fifth National Human Development Report organised by the Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics (MDPS) under the theme 'Towards sustainable development'. The symposium was attended by several officials from public bodies as well as experts and members of civil society organisations.
Mohammed al Athba, assistant undersecretary for planning affairs,told Qatar Tribune that the report focused on human capital which is an indication of the abilities and skills of people.
"This symposium acts as a brainstorming session which will deliver a draft note to the decision-makers to help them make clear policies," Athba said. The draft comes in the light of launching the National Development Strategy in the fields of education and training to achieve the human development targets set for 2030, he said.
"Health and education are the focus of this meeting and we are joining hands to promote services and human capital," Athba added.
This symposium comes within the framework of the constant efforts of MDPS to prepare the Qatar Human Development Report which is consistent with the national, regional and international necessities to confront the challenges in the fields of human development, supporting national development strategies and current and future planning policies.
