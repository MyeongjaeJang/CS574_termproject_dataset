Russell Westbrook's fifth straight triple double helped the Oklahoma City Thunder end the Toronto Raptors 11-game NBA winning streak on Sunday, as the Portland Trail Blazers rumbled to a 13th consecutive victory.
Westbrook scored 37 points, pulled down 13 rebounds and handed out 14 assists. His heroics, including back-to-back baskets to break a tie with 54.9 seconds remaining, denied the Raptors the longest win streak in club history.
Toronto remained atop the Eastern Conference with a 52-18 record, but the Raptors were fuming after a chaotic end to the contest. DeMar DeRozan, who led Toronto with 24 points, was ejected with less than 10 seconds to play for arguing with an official.
"You know the frustration, you know what it came down to," said DeRozan. "It was obvious, especially at the end of the game."
Teammate Serge Ibaka was tossed moments later, then Toronto coach Dwane Casey was ejected √ê although video appeared to show it was a fan behind him who yelled at the referee. Casey was measured in his post-game comments, saying only that the Raptors are looking for "fairness and consistency" from officials and adding: "We'll complain in the proper way."
Led by Damian Lillard's 23 points, all five Trail Blazers starters scored in double figures in a 122-109 victory over the Clippers in Los Angeles.
CJ McCollum and Maurice Harkless scored 21 points apiece, Jusuf Nurkic added 17 and Al-Farouq Aminu chipped in 16 as Portland's starters out-scored their Clippers counterparts 98-44.
