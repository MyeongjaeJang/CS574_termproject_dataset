Qatar has written a letter to the UN Security Council and Secretary-General, voicing concern over renewed violations of its airspace by Bahrain.
In a message to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Karel van Oosterom, Qatar's Permanent Representative to the United Nations HE Ambassador Sheikha Alia Ahmed bin Saif al Thani said a Bahraini fighter jet violated Qatar's airspace on Sunday (March 25).
Describing the incident as a flagrant violation of international law, the letter noted that repeated violations of Qatari sovereignty would increase tension in the region undermining security and stability. Qatar urged the United Nations to take measures to put an end to repeated Bahraini violations.
The message emphasised that Qatar has continued to excersise restraint despite irresponsible and provocative practices. The letter said Qatar reserves the right to respond to any violations and will not hesitate to take measures to protect its sovereignty and defend its borders, airspace, territorial waters and national security in line with international laws and regulations.
