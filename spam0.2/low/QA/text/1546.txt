THE Public Works Authority (Ashghal) signed a memorandum of cooperation (MoC) with Al Shabhana Environmental Association, a voluntary organisation that has carried out a number of environmental impact studies, in an effort to protect plants and the Qatari environment.
On behalf of Al Shabhana Association, which functions to protect the environment, co-founder Abdullah bin Khalid al Khater signed the MoC with Ashghal.
The major areas on which the MoC will focus include the conservation of natural water streams and plants, including the Qatari National Tree.
Ashghal's President Saad bin Ahmad al Muhannadi said the Authority seeks support of voluntary organisations, especially in the field of environment in its infrastructure projects. The experience of Al Shabhana Association and studies will help Ashghal minimise the impact of construction on land. The MoC signed on Tuesday is an initiative from Ashghal to protect the plants and the environment of Qatar.
Al Shabhana Association's Khater said that the new initiative will help raise awareness about the environment and enhance the importance of environmental conservation while exploring the land for infrastructure developments.
