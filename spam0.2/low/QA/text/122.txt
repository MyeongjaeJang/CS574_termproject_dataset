Marhaba brings you weekly podcasts by Doha Heat, a communal podcast set up by Ginger Camel Media . 
Doha Heat is for every type of individual who currently calls Qatar home, has in the past, or may one day. The interviews are very relaxed and seek to be honest conversations, like the type you might have with a friend over coffee/tea/karak. 
In this week’s podcast, Doha Heat speaks to Carlo Yan, founder of Filipiknows – a fun interactive online community for Filipinos worldwide.
