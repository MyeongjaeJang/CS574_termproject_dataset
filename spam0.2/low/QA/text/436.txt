Qatar, which chairs the United Nations (UN) Asia-Pacific Group for March, has stressed the group's efforts to find ways to promote values of tolerance, accept differences among people and promote a culture of respect for diversity within the societies of the group's countries and other countries of the world.
This came during the speech of Qatar's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador HE Sheikha Alia Ahmed bin Saif al Thani, to the UN General Assembly on behalf of the Asia-Pacific Group on the occasion of International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
On behalf of the Asia-Pacific Group, Sheikha Alia expressed concern at the growing hatred, ethnic intolerance and negative stereotypes based on religion, language, culture or ethnic diversity.
She appealed to the international community to take concrete action accompanied by a strong political will to mobilise all efforts at the national, regional and international levels to address all forms and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance through cooperation, partnership and integration.
