The forum will discuss with all the transparency and objectivity various current issues, through several sessions dealing with the challenges and events in the Middle East, he added.
He stressed that the sixth edition of the Doha Forum for Policies and Strategies reflects the cumulative continuity of knowledge established over the past five years of the conference and follow-up events on the international scene.
