Tunisia on Sunday began implementing new increases in fuel prices, the second such hike in three months, as the country continues to grapple with an economic downturn.
The new increases, estimated at around 3 per cent, came into effect at midnight (2300 GMT).
The Energy Ministry said the price of petrol increased to 1.85 dinars (0.77 dollars) from 1.8 dinars per litre.
Prices of other fuel products have risen by the same rate.
The ministry said in a statement that the increases were part of the country's automatic fuel pricing mechanism, and came as oil prices rise across global markets.
The move is considered an attempt to help curb Tunisia's budget deficit. The most recent increase in fuel prices came in January.
Tunisia~is widely seen as the sole democratic success story of the 2010-11 Arab Spring uprisings. However, the North African country is in the grips of an economic slowdown, and the government has vowed to pursue economic reforms.~
In February, data from~Tunisia's central bank showed that currency reserves had fallen to 11.8 billion Tunisian dinars (about 4.9 billion dollars), the lowest in 15 years.
The fall was attributed to the decline in the value of the local currency and the widening trade deficit that reached 6.2 billion dollars in 2017.
