OVER 2,500 delegates from more than 75 countries are taking part in the largest conference on healthcare quality improvement and patient safety in the Arab world.
The 6th Middle East Forum on Quality and Safety in Healthcare features more than 60 sessions delivered by over 20 international and 65 locally-based presenters.
The programme, developed in collaboration with Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), focuses on patient-centred care, the internationally recognised concept known as 'joy at work', improvement science, patient safety, and leadership and capacity building.
Held under the theme 'Building a Culture of Safety', the three-day conference features the annual event's largest programme to date. 'Knowledge Zone', the Forum's exhibition area, is a key attraction for delegates, with over 20 exhibitors. (TNN)
