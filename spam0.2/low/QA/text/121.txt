Qatar Petroleum Awards FEED Contract to Chiyoda Corp of Japan Posted on Comments Qatar Petroleum (QP) has selected Chiyoda Corporation of Japan to implement the Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) of the onshore facilities of the North Field Expansion. The facilities will produce an additional 23 million tonnes of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) per annum (mtpa) which will raise Qatar’s production from 77 to 100 mtpa, as announced by QP last July. QP President and CEO Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi expressed great pleasure at this latest development. The expansion of Qatar’s LNG production from the North Field is an important landmark in Qatar Petroleum’s strategic growth plan and objectives to be one of the best national oil and gas companies in the world. We are continuing our discussions with potential international joint venture partners for this strategic project to determine an optimised arrangement to deliver maximum value to the State of Qatar and contribute to the optimal utilisation of the country’s natural resources.’ The FEED scope of work will provide the basic design for the addition of 3 x 7.8 mtpa mega-trains of LNG production with associated pre-investment to add a fourth LNG train in the future. The onshore facilities will receive approximately 4.6 billion standard cubic feet per day of FEED gas from the southern sector of the North Field. Qatargas has been entrusted with implementing this mega-project on behalf of QP. Qatargas, which has a well-proven history in delivering such major projects, also have an established relationship with Chiyoda Corporation.
