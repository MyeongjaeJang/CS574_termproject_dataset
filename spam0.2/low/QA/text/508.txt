America's so-called"Dreamer"immigrants and supportive lawmakers were left fuming and fearful Friday after anti-deportation measures were left out of a federal spending bill signed by President Donald Trump.
More than six months after Trump announced he was scrapping an Obama-era program that protected hundreds of thousands of immigrants who arrived in the country illegally as children, he signed the controversial measure into law -- then blamed Democrats for the collapse of immigration negotiations.
"The Republicans are with you, they want to get your situation taken care of,"Trump said at the White House.
Democrats, he said, fought against a deal for Dreamers"every single inch of the way. They did not want DACA in this bill."
Some 690,000 immigrants are registered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that Trump ended on March 5.
