QATAR has called on the international community and the United Nations (UN) Security Council to shoulder their responsibility to stop Israeli crimes against Palestinians as well as to put an end to the Israeli policy of collective punishment against the Palestinian people.
"Israel's barbaric act against the unarmed Palestinians, who took part in the Great March of Return in the Gaza Strip, shows its arrogance and blatant defiance of the international community, with complete disregard for the consequences of its acts," Saif bin Muqaddam al Buainain, Qatar's permanent representative to the Arab League, said at the emergency meeting of the League in Cairo on Tuesday.
Buainain said Qatar reiterates its strong condemnation of the brutal crime committed by the Israeli occupation against the peaceful demonstrations of the unarmed people on the anniversary of the Land Day, killing and injuring several of them, in flagrant violation of all international conventions and laws.
"Qatar salutes the steadfastness of the heroic Palestinian people, who stand with all pride and honour. Qatar reiterates its consistent position in supporting the Palestinian cause and the steadfastness of the Palestinian people in their legitimate struggle for their freedom, independence, self-determination and the establishment of their independent state on the borders of June 4, 1967, with East Jerusalem as its capital," Buainain added.
The meeting discussed ways to confront the crimes of Israel, the occupying power, against peaceful protestors who took part in the Great March of Return. It also discussed the continuous and dangerous events being carried out by the Israeli entity in the Palestinian territories, most recently the Israeli massacre committed against peaceful demonstrators on the Gaza Strip border, in which 16 Palestinians were martyred and more than 1,500 wounded.
