Kuwait's Deputy Foreign Minister Khalid al Jarallah has affirmed that Switzerland fully supports his country's efforts to resolve the Gulf crisis.
In a statement to Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) following the conclusion of the fourth strategic dialogue between Kuwait and Switzerland, Jarallah said Switzerland had expressed its readiness to support the Kuwaiti efforts through ideas that could contribute to finding a solution to the Gulf crisis if asked to do so. Ever since the crisis broke out in June last year, Kuwait has been making efforts to resolve the dispute between Qatar and its neighbours.
