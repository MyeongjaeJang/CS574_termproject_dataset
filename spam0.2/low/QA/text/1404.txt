Chicago A young Texan from a wealthy family who used"affluenza"as a defence for a deadly drunk-driving crash was sent home Monday after a two years in jail, US media reported.
Ethan Couch was imprisoned for a 2013 accident in which the then-16-year-old killed four people when he crashed his pickup truck into a group of pedestrians and another vehicle.
Couch, who had a blood-alcohol level nearly three times the legal limit for an adult, pleaded guilty to four counts of intoxication manslaughter.
The son of millionaire parents made headlines when a psychologist testifying on his behalf claimed that the teen suffered from"affluenza."
The term, coined from affluence and influenza, implied that financial privilege made the teenager unable to understand the consequences of his actions. (AFP)
