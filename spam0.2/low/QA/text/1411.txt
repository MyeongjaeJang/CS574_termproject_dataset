In a series of demeaning and humiliating tweets, a senior Dubai police official has launched a vitriolic attack on Pakistani citizens working in the UAE.
Dhahi Khalfan, a senior police official in Dubai, is not new to controversies and is known to shoot off his mouth.
"We have seen great harm caused by the Pakistanis to our Gulf communities. I urge our citizens not to employ Pakistanis. It is now a national duty to stop hiring Pakistanis," Khalfan said in tweets posted on his official Twitter account.
In another tweet, Quote: : "How come Indians are disciplined, while sedition, criminality and smuggling are rampant in the Pakistani community."
This fierce attack unleashed by Khalfan on the Pakistanis was preceded by reports that spoke of deterioration in Saudi-UAE and Pakistani relations.
The Wall Street Journal revealed that Saudi Arabia had abandoned Pakistan's support and succumbed to US pressure to include Islamabad on a terrorism financing list, despite Pakistan sending 1,000 troops to Saudi Arabia to protect the country, according to reports.
Several Western newspapers have recently reported the conflict between the UAE and Pakistan over ports.
The UAE sees expansion of the Gwadar port in Pakistan as a game changer that could reshape the economic agenda for the region.
Many economic analysts believe that port of Gwadar could pose a threat to Dubai in the region.
