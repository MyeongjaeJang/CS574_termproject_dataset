Al Malki Group conducted a day-long workshop on Solar Energy under the platform of the Qatar Oryx chapter of Ashrae (American Society for Heating Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers). Around 200 Engineers attended the Event.
Six renowned speakers from Cyprus International University and Eastern Mediterranean University in Turkey spoke during the day on solar power generation, design and sizing of on-gird PV systems, use of energy performance simulation in buildings, solar energy and absorption cooling application, PV performance analysis under different tilt angle, different orientation, dust effect and different mounting system, and demand-side management for promotion of sustainable energy technologies. There was an interactive question-and-answer session at the end of the workshop.
In his opening remarks, the past president and Ashrae Qatar Oryx Chapter Advisory Board Chairman Hassan Sultan thanked Qatar for encouraging and allowing the professional development of engineers in Qatar. He felicitated the speakers with appreciation plaques.
Ashrae, founded in 1894, is a global society advancing human well-being through sustainable technology for the built environment. The Society and its members focus on building systems, energy efficiency, indoor air quality, refrigeration and sustainability within the industry.
