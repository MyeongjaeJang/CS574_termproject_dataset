The Qatar Football Association has sought approval from world soccer governing body FIFA to introduce Video Assistant Refereeing (VAR) technology in the upcoming Qatar Cup matches. 
In cooperation with Al Kass Sports Channels, the QFA already used VAR in the QSL Cup, Qatargas U-23 League matches and QFA U-17 semi-finals. 
In March, VAR was used in a number of Qatargas U-23 League matches including the Al Gharafa and Al Markhiya and Umm Salal and Al Arabi. 
Last week, the technology was used at the QFA U-17 Cup semi-finals between Al Gharafa and Al Arabi and Al Sadd and Duhail. 
QFA referees have demonstrated a good understanding of the requirements needed to apply the technology correctly, and this is a result of the efforts they have made during previous VAR training. 
"The process of implementing the technology is ongoing and is working more effectively now than when it started," said Executive Director of the QFA Referees Department Neji Jouini. 
"We have seen great results, and the most important thing is that people are starting to accept the implementation of this technology more than before because accepting a new concept takes time." 
In a move aimed at optimising the application of the technology, the referees department is intending to use VAR in round 20 of Qatargas U-23 League on April 2. Â© Copyright Qatar Tribune. All Rights Reserved. Rate Article:
