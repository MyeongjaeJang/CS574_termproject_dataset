Qatar's former world champion Adel Abdulla maintained second position in the T2 standings but lost a little ground to his main rival through the third loop stage of 281.38km in the soft sand dunes of the Rub Al-Khali on Tuesday.
Using a rented Nissan Safari Y61 to continue his campaign to regain the FIA T2 World Championship title, Abdulla began the day's special 29min 24.9sec behind Ahmed Shegawi. He and navigator Nasser al Kuwari crossed the finish line in punishing heat in a time of 5hrs 18min 17sec and now trail their rival by 47min 53.9sec heading into the final two days of the event.
Abdulla said after the day's action:"Today we started one minute ahead of the leader but we were stuck in the first 15km in very soft sand. The leader saw us, avoided the place and passed us. That was the main problem we faced today.
"Later we managed to get the car out of the sand and launched a big chase. We tried to push all the way to the finish line but we had lost about 20 minutes to the leader. Anyway, the second place is perfect for me and we still have two days to go," Abdulla added.
Abdulla is running his T2 programme with the crucial support of the Qatar government, the Qatar Motor and Motorcycle Federation (QMMF) and Ooredoo Qatar.
Lower down the T2 field, Russia's Yuliya Khegay-Migunova was badly delayed once again and Romania's Claudia Laurentiu Barbu has already incurred massive time penalties.
Competitors will tackle the penultimate selective section of the event on Wednesday, a third loop stage of 244.49km through the Liwa Desert.
