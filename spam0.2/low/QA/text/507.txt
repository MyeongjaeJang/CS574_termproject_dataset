Dulsco, a regional leader in environmental solutions, conducted environmental awareness sessions at Doha College, on both Al Waab and West Bay campuses before an audience of intrigued students.
The focus of the awareness week was to educate the younger generation about the importance of recycling. Most of the topics covered were related to waste: its definition, its different types and how to segregate it. The collaboration between Dulsco and Doha College highlighted to students what their responsibilities are toward the environment, and how to preserve the natural heritage of Qatar.
The primary school students were keen to participate in the interactive presentations delivered by Nicola Maxwell, Regional Head of Commercial, Allan DeCampo, Sales Manager, and Sholto Diack, HSE Consultant from Dulsco.
Afterwards, there were exciting live demonstrations of the compactor and skip loader, much to the delight of the students. The campaign also included a collection of plastic bottles for recycling, and the total amount of plastic bottles brought from home during the week was a staggering 188kg.
As responsible corporate citizens, Dulsco Qatar and Doha College make it a priority to collaborate in helping the community move ever closer towards achieving Qatar's National Vision 2030.
In September 2016, Doha College became the first school in Qatar to be awarded the coveted Eco-Schools status from Denmark-based Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE), under their scheme for international schools.
