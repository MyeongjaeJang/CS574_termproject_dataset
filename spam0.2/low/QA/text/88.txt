The head of Iraqi Football Association (IFA) Abdul Khaleq Masoud has praised the efforts made by Qatar Football Association (QFA), which resulted in the FIFA decision to lift the ban on holding official matches in Basra, Karbala and Erbil.
The QFA received a message from its Iraqi counterpart thanking and appreciating the 'excellent and great support' extended by QFA under the chairmanship of Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa bin Ahmed al Thani.
The International Football Federation (FIFA) announced on Friday that it decided to lift the ban on Iraq allowing it to host international matches in three cities.
FIFA President Gianni Infantino announced the ban's lifting on stadiums in Basra, Karbala and Erbil at the FIFA Council Meeting in Bogota on Friday.
The IFA note said:"On the behalf of the members of the Board of Directors of the Iraqi Football Association, and Iraqi sports fans, I extend my thanks and great gratitude to your efforts, your continuous and unlimited support of Iraqi football, which culminated in the decision of FIFA to allow us to host matches in Basra, Karbala and Erbil."
"In these three cities, international matches will be allowed to be played as far as FIFA is concerned," Infantino told reporters in Bogota.
The three cities had been hosting friendlies throughout the last year as a test run, reports said on Friday.
