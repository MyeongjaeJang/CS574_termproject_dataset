Tayyab belted an undefeated 124 off 86 balls to fire HBK to a massive 116-run victory and a place into the semi-finals of the Qatar Airways Cricket Tournament for the Premier Division teams.
At the West Bay Grounds, HBK, batting first, amassed 360 for five in 50 overs. After opener Zubair set the pace to the innings with a fine 55 off 69 balls, which included eight fours, and took them to 155 for three in 25 overs, Tayyab sent them scurrying to the formidable total.
He and Imal mustered 117 runs for the fourth wicket. Imal smashed a sixer and five boundaries in his 52-ball 57. Tayyab stayed unbeaten on 124, clobbering seven sixes and as many boundaries. Sewinda and Malik made 37 and 25, respectively.
It was quite difficult for Qatari Diar to sustain the chase in face of some tight bowling by Mughees and Ikram, who took five wickets between them. While Mughees picked three for 44, Ikram nabbed two for 21. Saqlain held the innings together after they were reduced at five down 44.
Saqlain cracked five sixes and six fours to compile 79 in just 54 balls. He was supported well by Amir, who had 39 with a six and four boundaries, and Waqar, who made 30 before the team folded up at 244 in 42 overs.
In another match, Al Feroz Youngsters proved too tough, beating Galfar Al Misnad by 99 runs. The winners, after getting 252 for eight in 50 overs, ran through the opponents and shot them out for 162 in 39.4 overs.
Nadeem led the collapse with three for 37, while Mujeeb and Inam-Ul Haq shared four scalps. Rizlan posted 35 with a six and three fours in 35 balls. Iqbal Chaudhry and Himanshu contributed 31 each.
Nouman of Al Feroz Youngsters was declared the Man of the Match for his superb 66 runs with five boundaries and one wicket. Humayun also batted brilliantly and his 63 contained five well-struck sixes and four hits to the rope.
