The search for worlds circling stars far beyond our solar system will intensify in the coming weeks with NASA's launch of a spacecraft scientists hope will enlarge the known catalog of so-called exoplanets believed capable of supporting life.
NASA plans to send the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, into orbit from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket set for blast-off on April 16 on a two-year, $337-million mission.
The latest NASA astrophysics endeavor is designed to build on the work of its predecessor, Kepler space telescope, which discovered bulk of some 3,500 exoplanets documented during the past 20 years, revolutionizing one of the newest fields in space science.
NASA expects TESS to detect thousands more previously unknown worlds, perhaps hundreds of them Earth-sized or"super-Earth"-sized -- no larger than twice as big as our home planet.
Such worlds are believed to stand the greatest chance of having rocky surfaces or oceans, and are thus considered the most promising candidates for the evolution of life, as opposed to gas giants similar to Jupiter or Neptune.
Astronomers said they hope to end up with about 100 more rocky exoplanets for further study. The new probe will take about 60 days to attain its highly elliptical, first-of-a-kind orbit that will loop TESS between Earth and the moon every two and a half weeks.
Kepler's positioning system broke down in 2013 about four years after its launch, and though scientists found a way to keep it operational it has nearly run out of fuel.
"So it's perfect timing that we'll be launching TESS to continue the great activity of looking for planets around stars other than our sun and thinking about what it might mean for life in the universe," Paul Hertz, NASA's director of astrophysics, told reporters at a news briefing in Washington .
