‚Äî Cher (@cher) March 30, 2018 Prince Turki Prince Turki was among more than 380 royals and businessmen rounded up in November in what authorities said was a crackdown on corruption.
A son of the late King Abdullah, the prince was once the governor of the Saudi capital Riyadh. He was one of the most prominent detainees to be held at the infamous Ritz-Carlton.
Prince Turki's top aide, Major General Ali al-Qahtani, was also arrested in the corruption probe and, according to a New York Times investigation, died while in custody with his body showing signs of torture.
Critics say the crackdown, spearheaded by the powerful bin Salman, is aimed at consolidating the 32-year-old's grip on power before he succeeds his father as king of the world's largest oil exporter.
Officials have not made public the charges against suspects held at the Ritz-Carlton.
Saudi Arabia's attorney general has said the state recovered $107bn in settlements, including property, securities and cash.
Saudi authorities said in January the bulk of the detainees, including those who agreed to settle, have been released.
