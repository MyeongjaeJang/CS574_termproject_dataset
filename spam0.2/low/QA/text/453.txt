Participants at the ongoing Qatar International Food Festival (QIFF) at the Hotel Park are a happy lot. The reason: the festival has given them a chance to meet new customers and make connections with other vendors while making great sales.
Organised by Qatar Tourism Authority and supported by various partners, the festival features 177 stalls, food trucks and trolleys offering diverse food and beverage.
Mitch, a vendor at Claw, a restaurant in Double Tree by Hilton, said this was their first at QIFF."The festival has given us a great opportunity. We are providing 44 cocktails."
Mitch added that they are giving discounts too.
A 'happy' Grace, a sales lady at Crazy Leaves, said that they were displaying 'warangenab' Arabic food with different flavours of corn, mushroom, beef and onion, among others."We are giving people a chance to try our delicacy. We don't have a shop yet. So, this is a wonderful opportunity," she said.
Noemi, in-charge of the Popcorn Girl stall, said the festival offered a good chance to suppliers and their customers. She added that they were able to meet new clients.
"Since we are selling food at a much cheaper price, many of our clients are coming here to buy in bulk. We also made new customers," she added.
Manager of Pasta Alfreej Mohammad El Boutary echoed Noemi and said that they are also having a great outing.
While Baba Chapatea Manager Pramod said the festival has been doing a great promotional service for all the participants. (By CATHERINE W GICHUKI)
