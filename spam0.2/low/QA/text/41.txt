Qatar's leading project management consultancy, Astad, has won a special recognition award for their product Sanad (the integrated suite of contracts) at the Construction Week Oman Awards in Muscat recently, a press statement said on Monday.
The awards event recognises and rewards the best the Oman construction industry has to offer.
Astad CEO Ali al Khalifa, said,"The recognition for Sanad is a tribute to the outstanding achievements and collective efforts of our team. Their efforts have helped this initiative gain traction in the industry and provided a positive contribution to Qatar's construction projects and now the Omani construction market."
Khalifa added,"Having been reviewed by more than 15 leading international legal and insurance firms in the construction industry, Sanad aims to bring all parties involved in a project together by reducing costs, maintaining fair appropriate risk for all parties and offering more balanced contract terms and conditions."
The award was received by General Manager of Astad International, Abdulaziz al Mulla.
Mulla said,"I am very proud of this accolade, which is a testament to the years of dedication that has been invested into Sanad. It was developed utilising Astad's years of experience working on over 250 projects in this region, with a dedicated team who each have more than 20 years of contract expertise.
"With this, I am confident that these world-class construction contracts will continue to prove beneficial to Oman."
Sanad is an integrated suite of contracts that includes four contract templates and forms covering construction, design and build, design services and professional services. It refines contractual procedures in the construction industry in Qatar and the region, while simultaneously utilised as an educational reference. Two new Sanad additions will be launching in April at Moushtaryat 2018 to provide contractual support for smaller-scale projects.
