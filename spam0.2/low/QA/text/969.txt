THE World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE), an initiative of Qatar Foundation (QF), recently presented a range of research reports addressing topics in education at the Annual Research Conference 2018 (ARC'18).
WISE presented its 2017 research reports on areas including school leadership and collaborative professionalism, design thinking, apprenticeship, disability, early childhood education and migration, among others, to ARC'18, held at the Qatar National Convention Centre on March 19 and 20.
The reports were produced in collaboration with experts from around the world, including the World Bank, IDEO, University of Oxford, LearnLabs, and the Ministry of Education and Higher Education in Qatar.
Dr Ahmed Baghdady, Manager of Research and Content Development, WISE, who presented at ARC'18, said:"I am delighted to share my views on how to move from research to impact. We need to understand that the main goal of research is to improve human life. In education, this is clear in the impact that policy research has on the outcomes of education and human capital development."
The comprehensive reports address global education issues and reflect the priorities of the Qatar National Research Strategy. They feature action-oriented recommendations and policy guidance for all education stakeholders offering concrete, improved practices in specific contexts. The reports are available on the WISE website and selected reports are available in Arabic editions.
ARC is Qatar Foundation Research and Development's (QF R&D) flagship conference showcasing the latest multidisciplinary knowledge tackling the most pressing challenges in research.
