Off the next move, Lacy effected a brilliant block off Michael Taylor and then Franklin fouled on Issac Mack, who accepted both the gifts from the charity stripe and completed a splendid three-point triumph, their second in a row.

For Al Gharafa Club, Franklin and Sammy Monroe both a commendable double-double apiece but they could not inspire other teammates.
