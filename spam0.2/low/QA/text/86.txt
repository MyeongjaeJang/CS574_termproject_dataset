Four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel and Nico Hulkenberg are the only Germans left in Formula One racing when the season starts on Sunday in Australia.
It is the lowest number of drivers for the car-crazy nation in 22 year since Michael Schumacher and Heinz-Harald Frentzen in 1996.
Boosted mainly by the big success of the record seven-time world champion Schumacher and the rising Vettel, Germany had a maximum seven men in the sport in 2010: Schumacher, Vettel, Hulkenberg, Nico Rosberg, Timo Glock, Adrian Sutil and Nick Heidfeld.
Schumacher ruled the sport with his titles for Benetton and Ferrari, and his 91 race wins also remain unrivalled.
Vettel won four straight world titles between 2010 and 2013, and is tied with Schumacher on a record 13 grand prix wins in one season. Rosberg won the 2016 world title and retired afterwards.
Ralf Schumacher managed six race wins, Heidfeldt got 13 podium finishes, Glock three, and Patrick Wehrlein claimed the lone championship point for the short-lived Manor team.
In his second season in F3 is meanwhile 18-year-old Mick Schumcher. He came 12th overall in his 2017 debut, and with a long way to go to make it into F1 racing like his famous father.
