Qatar Chamber (QC) is in talks with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education to open more schools and increase the number of seats in the existing schools to accommodate rising number of students, a senior official has said.
The new academic year has begun this month in most private schools, but a large number of parents are still not able to get admission for their wards due to shortage of seats.
Qatar Chamber Vice-Chairman Mohammed bin Ahmed bin Towar al Kuwari told Qatar Tribune that many expatriate parents, especially from Asian and African communities, are facing difficulty in getting their wards admitted in schools.
"The number of private schools, which currently accommodate 200,000 of the total 300,000 school-going children in the country, needs to be increased without delay. Private parties are ready to build more schools provided they get land at reasonable prices," Kuwari said.
"We have requested the ministry to allot plots to build new schools. The government is very supportive and we expect new private schools to come up in the country in the near future," he said.
Kuwari said the chamber has also sought permission from the ministry to increase the number of seats in existing private schools to find an immediate solution to this problem.
Given the rapid growth of expatriate population in the country, Kuwari said, investments in private schools in Qatar are expected to triple by 2020.
The private education sector in Qatar has expanded significantly in the past few years, he said.
The government's support would ensure expansion of this vital sector, he added.
