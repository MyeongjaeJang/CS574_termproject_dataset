More than 1,500 Palestinians have also been injured by Israeli snipers during the protests , according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. 
The violent Israeli response to the Palestinian protests has triggered world outcry with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres calling for an independent and transparent investigation into the killings along the Gaza border. 
Friday's rallies were the start of a six-week protest that culminates on May 15, the day the Palestinians call as the " Nakba ", or "catastrophe" - the day Israel was created. 
The demonstrators are demanding that Palestinian refugees be allowed the right of return to towns and villages from which their families fled, or were driven out, when the state of Israel was created in 1948. Palestine and Israel: One state, or two?
