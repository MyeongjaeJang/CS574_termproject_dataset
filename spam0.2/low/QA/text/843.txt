Waymo and Jaguar Land Rover on Tuesday announced they have joined forces on a posh, self-driving electric car tailored for a ride-hailing service run by the Google-owned firm.
Waymo's latest alliance came as Uber's testing of self-driving cars in the US is on hold due to one of the vehicles being in an accident last week that killed a pedestrian.
Waymo and Jaguar said they aim to develop a"premium self-driving electric vehicle" based on a new I-PACE model.
Testing of an I-PACE equipped with Waymo self-driving technology will begin later this year, and the goal was to make it part of a Waymo driverless transportation service, according to Jaguar.
The companies forecast that as many as 20,000 I-PACE vehicles could be built in the first two years of production and made available for a Waymo service that lets people summon autonomous rides.
"This is just the beginning," the Waymo team said in an online post.
"The ultimate goal: with Waymo as the driver, products tailored for every purpose and every trip."
For example, self-driving vehicles could be designed for various needs such as working while commuting; celebratory nights out, or napping, according to Waymo.
Waymo chief executive John Krafcik over the weekend contended that the recent death of a pedestrian in an accident involving an autonomous Uber car would not have occurred with his company's technology.
"At Waymo, we have a lot of confidence that our technology would be able to handle a situation like that," Krafcik said in Las Vegas on Saturday.
