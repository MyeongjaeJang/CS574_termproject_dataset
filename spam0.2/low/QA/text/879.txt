The Qatar Swimming Federation will host the second round of the FINA World Swimming Cup from September 13 to 15 for the seventh consecutive year.
The event is the second international swimming event to be hosted by Qatar this year. The first round of the 10-kilometre Open World Swimming Championships was recently held in Doha, in which Dutchman Ferry Fertman and his wife Sharon van Ruendal won first place in their respective categories.
The 2018 World Swimming Cup in Doha will be different from the last six years. It will be held on the 50 metres long course and will last three days. Previously, it was contested over the short course of 25 metres and finished within two days.

The first round will take place in Kazan (September 7-9), the second round in Doha (September 13-15), the third round in Eindhoven (September 28-30), the fourth round is scheduled in Budapest (October 4-6), the fifth round in Beijing (2-4 November), the sixth round in Tokyo (November 9-11) and the seventh round in Singapore (November 15-17). The first two legs will be contested over 50-metre course, while the rest over short course of 25 metres.
