Qatar is building its diplomacy on the basis of its principles, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs HE Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al Thani has said.
"We are building our diplomacy on the basis of our principles, and we believe that our region needs a coherent security strategy that enables people to coexist and live in peace," Sheikh Mohammed said at an event organised by the International Diplomatic Academy in Paris on Friday.
"The basic pillar of our principle is that people are not subject to any political deal. When the issue is between the government and the people, we stand with the people," he added.
In his speech on"Qatar's perspective on regional issues", Sheikh Mohammed said what happened in the Gulf crisis was an attack and aggression and an attempt at regime change in Qatar.
"This is not new. The same attempt was made in 2014 and in 1996. This aggression started against Qatar when it started to adapt to change, implementing a different strategy and a different vision. These countries do not accept differences of opinion and do not accept a country that has a different approach," Sheikh Mohammed said, adding that"We refuse to give up our sovereignty."
The FM pointed out that"no concerns had been mentioned before the siege imposed on Qatar" and that the blockading countries have created the crisis at a time when the region faces many challenges.
"When we started our policy, we focused on different dimensions. The first step was to liberalise our media. We were the first country in the region to close the Ministry of Communication and Information. We started legislating free media, guaranteeing freedom of expression under the law, focusing on human capital and means of developing it," he said.
"We have invited universities from different countries, including from France, the US and the UK, and we have given them freedom of expression. Investing in the human element has been one of our main priorities," said Sheikh Mohammed.
He noted that Qatar produced 650,000 barrels of oil in 1995 and that œoil prices put Qatar in a difficult financial situation, but the Emir HH Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani decided to invest in gas at a time when no one believed in the power of gas .
Qatar was now one of the largest exporters of natural gas, he noted.
œWe have developed technology for this industry and that put us together with the world's leading LNG players in terms of production and shipping,  Sheikh Mohammed added.
œWe have worked on diversification as part of our economic vision, where the surplus of our budget and revenues were invested in different sectors and in different countries, and then the Qatar sovereign fund was established. 
œWe believe in international cooperation and the development plan is an essential part of our policy. We believe in the need to focus on human capital, and that is why we have allocated 50 percent of our external development assistance to education,  he added.
œWe set a vision a few years ago to educate 10 million children in vulnerable countries and so far more than 7 million children are being educated through Qatari programmes,  the FM noted.
Sheikh Mohammed said Qatar has a partnership with France and other countries and the Qatari programmes in Africa are working with the help of a French development company.
œWe believe in the empowerment of young people as part of our national agenda, where we have made initiatives to create jobs,  he said, adding that œwe have the Silatech Foundation, which was established to create jobs for Arab youth in Yemen, Morocco and other countries in the region .
In this regard, he referred to the provision of more than 300,000 jobs so far as well as the provision of 50,000 jobs for young people through the Qatar Friendship Fund (QFF) in Tunisia. œOur foreign policy is based on these basic principles and we are using this as a key tool to achieve this vision,  Sheikh Mohammed said.
He said the region has a lot of resources and high potential. œWe have many young people and we consider them fuel for prosperity, but we need to give them the right means to achieve this vision,  he said.
Sheikh Mohammed described Qatar's relations with France as œhistoric and with its characteristics.  He said France stood with Qatar in the early days of the Gulf crisis.
