Ahlibank has a network of 67 ATMs located in its branches and non-bank sites such as malls and popular tourist areas across Qatar.
The joint service has been launched in response to growing demand for alternative payment channels that allow Ooredoo customers to utilise the services 24/7 and save time by avoiding long queues.

Alongside the Ooredoo App, Ooredoo Self-Service Machines and now Ahlibank ATM's, customers can easily stay connected 24/7."

With the addition of Ooredoo service on our ATM's, Ahlibank customers can now easily pay their Ooredoo bills and top-ups, enhancing the customer's experience. Ahlibank is delivering a simple, local, modern and secure banking experience at the heart of the Qatar community and bringing tomorrow's banking to Qatar today."
All Ooredoo transactions carried out at an Ahlibank ATM are instantly reflected in the user's Ooredoo account. This is supported by a unique agreement between the two to link their interfaces in real-time.
