A judge refused to grant comedienne and actress Kathy Griffin's neighbour a restraining order.
KB Home honcho Jeffrey Mezger wanted an order prohibiting Griffin from running audio on her security cameras, reports tmz.com. Griffin had caught Mezger on audio screaming epithets at her in the past.
Griffin also had her restraining order dismissed by the judge a few weeks ago.
The original dispute was over noise complaints made by Griffin and her boyfriend Randy Bick.
