MINISTER of Municipality and Environment HE Mohammed bin Abdullah al Rumaihi said on Saturday that Qatar pays great attention to protecting the environment.
"Some of the country's efforts in the field were related specifically to climate change, where Qatar has shown a commitment to playing a prominent regional and international role. This was reflected in the country's constant support to global efforts in protecting the environment and stopping the depletion of natural resources," the minister said, in a speech to mark the Earth Hour, which is observed globally on the last Saturday of March every year.
Rumaihi added that his ministry's participation in this global event aims to draw attention to the need to address the phenomenon of climate change. Earth Hour can help promote a culture of preserving the planet just by encouraging people around the world to turn off the lights for one hour on one day of the year in a symbolic gesture, the minister said.
