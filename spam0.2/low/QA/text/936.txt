HH Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, Chairperson of the Education Above All Foundation (EAA) and Advocate for the UN Sustainable Development Goals, has urged the global community to facilitate access to quality education for displaced children and to enforce severe penalties on perpetrators of armed conflict.
"Education must be given priority as it is the tool for the children of the present and future. A global approach needs to be adopted to remove institutional barriers which prevent the recognition and verification of refugee education," Sheikha Moza told a high-level panel discussion organised by the (EAA) in cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva on Wednesday.
The session titled"Quality Education for a Sustainable Future: A Comprehensive Approach for Refugees and Internally Displaced People" touched on the ways to ensure education for refugees and internally displaced persons to build a prosperous future for all.
The session was attended by United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi.
Speaking about the obstacles facing the education of refugee and displaced children, Sheikha Moza said,"The increasing armed conflicts target all that is being built. The world needs to unite in order to stop those who are encouraging armed conflict and to impose stricter sanctions on them by the UN."
Earlier, Sheikha Moza and Filippo Grandi discussed the joint efforts of EAA and UNHCR, which include providing quality education to refugee children.
