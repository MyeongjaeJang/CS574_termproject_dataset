Qatar's 2016 world champion Adel Abdulla confirmed second position in the T2 standings at the Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge with the fastest time in the final 218.57km selective section from Hameem to the south of Abu Dhabi on Thursday morning.
Driving a rented Nissan Safari Y61 in insipid heat, the Qatari and navigator Nasser al Kuwari carded a stage-winning time of 3hrs 23min 22sec and managed to shave 11min 38sec off rival Ahmed Shegawi's eventual winning margin of 45min 53.9sec.
The performance also earned Adel 12th in the overall standings a particularly impressive result with a near-standard car on one of the toughest cross-country events in the world.
A delighted Abdulla said:"We decided to take a risk and pushed very hard right from the start today. Suddenly we saw Shegawi. I think he had a flat tyre or something. We passed him and I kept pushing hard till the end of the stage. I was pushing the car to its maximum and I didn't even slow down when the engine temperature went a bit higher. Some sections today were open and fast and, maybe, that helped cool the car down.
"The risk paid off because we won the stage today by over 11 minutes. This is fantastic for us. The second place is good with the situation we had. We could not bring our car. I tried my best to do the race and collect maximum possible points. To secure 36 points is very important for us in the world championship fight.
"Nasser, my co-driver, managed everything in the right way. We were confident together in the car. The weather conditions were very hot. Today, the air temperature was 37'b0C, which was too much in the dunes."I also want to thank my team here on their good job. I want to thank my sponsors, the Qatar Motor and Motorcycle Federation (QMMF), Ooredoo Qatar and Nissan Qatar."
The next stop in the FIA World Cup calendar will be the Qatar Cross-Country Rally in three weeks' time.
