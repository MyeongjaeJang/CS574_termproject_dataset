Belgium's Courtois to Miss Saudi Arabia Friendly Through Injury Belgium's Courtois to Miss Saudi Arabia Friendly Through Injury   13:55   Facebook Twitter Google+ Linkedin Pinterest Delicious Stumbleupon Digg Reddit Thibaut Courtois Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has withdrawn from the Belgium squad for Tuesday's friendly against Saudi Arabia due to a hamstring injury, the Belgian Football Association (RBFA) said on Sunday. The 25-year-old played in Chelsea's 3-0 defeat by Barcelona in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie but missed the club's FA Cup win over Leicester City last week, with manager Antonio Conte saying Courtois had a muscle injury. Courtois was called up by Belgium despite the problem but has failed to recover in time. "Thibaut Courtois has not recovered from his hamstring injury and left the group... Get well soon, Thibaut!" the RBFA said on their official Twitter account. The RBFA said that Belgium manager Roberto Martinez is yet to decide on Courtois' replacement for the friendly with Liverpool's Simon Mignolet likely to start. Â© Copyright Qatar Tribune.
