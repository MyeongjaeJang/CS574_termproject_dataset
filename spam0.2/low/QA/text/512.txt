WASHINGTON
Incoming White House national security adviser John Bolton's history of clashes with US intelligence agencies suggests how he might handle North Korea and Iran, two of the thorniest challenges he and US President Donald Trump face.
Bolton takes over on April 9 from retiring Army Lt. Gen. HR McMaster. Based on his public statements, he shares Trump's dislike of the Iran nuclear deal and often-bellicose stance toward North Korea. However, his pronouncements on both issues are at odds with the assessments of U.S. intelligence agencies.
In a 2017 article in the conservative National Review, Bolton accused Iran of"significant violations"of the 2015 nuclear accord curbing the Islamic Republic's nuclear program.
As a senior State Department official from 2001 to 2005, Bolton exaggerated what the US government knew about weapons programs in Iraq, Cuba and Syria, and retaliated against analysts who differed with him, according to intelligence officials involved in the events.
"The question is, is he (Bolton) going to be like that, and start with the answer and shoehorn the intelligence to fit,"or take a more balanced view, said a former CIA official with more than 30 years'experience.
