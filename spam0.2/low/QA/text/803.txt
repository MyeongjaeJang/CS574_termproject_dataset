Qatar Airways Strengthens Ties with Russia through Art Posted on Comments 
Qatar Airways said it will further strengthen its ties with Russia through a five-year partnership with the forthcoming Cosmoscow International Contemporary Art Fair , which commences from September this year, during the widely celebrated Year of Culture between Russia and the State of Qatar. 
During the press conference at The St. Regis Hotel in Moscow, Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker highlighted the many benefits that the five year partnership will bring. A letter of intention between Cosmoscow and Qatar Airways was signed by Al Baker and the Founding Director of Cosmoscow, Margarita Pushkina , in the presence of Qatar Minister of Culture and Sports, Salah bin Ghanem bin Nasser Al Ali. 
Cosmoscow International Contemporary Art Fair 
The Cosmoscow International Contemporary Art Fair is an event that unites the contemporary Russian art market with the international art community. It is, in a way, a natural sponsorship choice for Qatar Airways. The airline is widely known for celebrating the arts, with its home and hub, Hamad International Airport , featuring inspiring installations such as the symbolic Lamp Bear by Swiss artist Urs Fischer , through to the more recent installation by American pop artist and designer, KAWS . 
As the General Partner of Cosmoscow, Qatar Airways will first be represented at the main venue of the Fair at Gostiny Dvor from 6 to 9 September this year, and will have an opportunity to participate in a number of Cosmoscow projects and programmes.
