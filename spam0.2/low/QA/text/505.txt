"WE are proud of the strong relations and collaboration we share with Qatar and it is my pleasure to witness the two countries' bilateral relations flourish over the past few years," Ambassador of Tunisia to Qatar HE Salah al Salhi has said.
The ambassador also stressed on Tunisia's keenness on reinforcing its international and regional role in repelling violence and extremism and supporting the values of tolerance and justice through its partnerships with friendly countries such as the State of Qatar.
"Furthermore, we would like to strengthen our collaboration in all fields including trade and investment," he said, adding that a large number of senior officials' mutual visits during the past year reflect the two countries' political will in developing their bilateral relations.
"The exchange of qualified human expertise between Tunisia and Qatar is considered one of the most prominent components of the bilateral ties between the two countries as the Tunisian population in Qatar reached 23,000 and is likely to increase in order to support Qatar's comprehensive development strategy and accelerate its mega projects for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the Qatar National Vision 2030," he added.
The ambassador was addressing an elite gathering of dignitaries at a recent event on the occasion of the 62nd National Day of the Republic of Tunisia.
He stressed that the ceremony aims to revive the memory of the liberation war martyrs from the Tunisian security and defence institutions responsible for the achievement of the country's independence."Tunisia succeeded in transitioning from the era of building the republic of independence to the era of establishing the second republic. So, we are currently in process of developing its institutions capable of guaranteeing the continuity of the democratic direction, in addition to the diversity of its political and partisan environment while preserving public and individual liberties."
The ambassador noted that Tunisia is preparing to crown its journey on May 6 by organising the first municipal elections under the new Constitution of the second republic which will enable the establishment of a decentralised local authority that implements the mechanisms of democracy and partnership in order to widen the inclusion of citizens and civil society institutions in designing the country's developmental projects.
"Tunisia will continue the journey of major reforms covering all its vital sectors as the economic indicators have shown that the country has regained its strategic capabilities which restored the international confidence in its tourism and economic sectors," he added.
