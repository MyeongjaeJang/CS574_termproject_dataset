THE Embassy of Bangladesh in Doha observed the 47th anniversary of the Independence and National Day with due solemnity on Monday.
The programme started with participation in simultaneous rendering of the national anthem world-wide at 5 o'clock in the morning on the embassy premises. It was followed by hoisting of the National Flag jointly by Chairman of Parliamentary Standing Committee on Ministry of Foreign Affairs and former Foreign Minister of Bangladesh Dr Dipu Moni, MP and the Ambassador of Bangladesh to Qatar HE Ashud Ahmed, in presence of embassy officials and the Bangladeshi community.
After the flag hoisting ceremony, special prayer was offered for the eternal peace of the departed souls of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the martyrs of the Liberation War as well as for the continued peace and prosperity of the country.
A discussion meeting on the day's significance was also held. Messages from the President, Prime Minister, Foreign Minister and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs were read out.
In his speech, Ambassador Ahmed recalled the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman for his unique role in the process of liberation of Bangladesh. He said that Bangladesh is now graduating from LDC status to the developing nation and reminded the audience that traditionally Bangladesh is sending unskilled workers and the need for these unskilled workers in Qatar is likely to be reduced after the 2022 World Cup in Doha.
"We all have to look for the sectors where skilled workers can find jobs. We are taking initiatives to explore other sectors like trade, investment and business. The embassy is also working to enhance Bangladesh-Qatar bilateral relations through high level visits from both sides," he added.
The Bangladesh MHM School & College, Doha, under the supervision of the Mission also arranged a programme on the school's premises to celebrate the Independence and National Day.
