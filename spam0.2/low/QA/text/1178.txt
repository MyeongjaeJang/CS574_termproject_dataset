InterContinental Doha-The City participated in the global Earth Hour movement to highlight climate change. This is the 6th year that the hotel has participated in the initiative.
From 8:30PM to 9:30PM, the lights in the hotel lobby, restaurants, exteriors, and also external signage were switched off in coordination with the worldwide activity. Colleagues of InterContinental Doha-The City joined together for a candle-lighting activity in the lobby and guests were encouraged to join in. Personalised messages were sent to all hotel guests informing them of the event and encouraging their participation, and residents of the hotel's Residence Suites partook by switching off their lights at home and joining the intimate mocktail reception held in the Lobby Lounge. An approximate 2,180 kilowatt-hours of electricity was saved during the activity.
Focusing the efforts not just in the hotel, InterContinental Doha-The City staff also contributed in the colleagues' compound and hotel cafeteria where all lights were turned off while team members gathered around together.
Other than Earth Hour, InterContinental Doha-The City constantly works to give back to the environment in various ways. Aligned with the global initiative of IHG (InterContinental Hotels Group), the hotel has heavily been involved with the IHG Green Engage global programme, an industry leading approach to environmental management and is the first hotel-specific system of its kind.
While the group target of the initiative is 1 percent of the reduction of carbon footprint, the Doha property has managed to achieve 9 percent in the last year alone, as it has greatly reduced its negative impact on the environment and has achieved Level 4 of the IHG Green Engage, making InterContinental Doha-The City a leader in this initiative.
