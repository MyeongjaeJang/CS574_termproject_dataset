COMMERCIAL Bank (CB), the exclusive financial services partner of Manchester United in Qatar, has successfully concluded the 5th Manchester United Soccer School in Qatar.
About 160 girls and boys aged seven to 16 took part in the soccer school at Al Arabi Stadium from March 18 to 22, with two Manchester United Soccer School coaches being specially flown in from the UK to provide the training.
Commercial Bank customers were awarded places for their children or younger siblings at the exclusive five-day soccer school by spending on their Commercial Bank Manchester United Credit Cards.
Under the guidance of Manchester United Soccer School coaches, the kids received an all-round training experience involving on-pitch techniques, related to Manchester United first team training, advice on how to behave off the pitch, understanding tactics and what it takes to develop a winning mentality.
Roya Khajeh, Commercial Bank AGM, Head of Cards and Payments, said:"Through our partnership, Commercial Bank is delighted to bring the popular Manchester United Soccer School back to Qatar for the fifth year. Simply by using the Credit Card, customers not only benefit from Commercial Bank's generous rewards programme, but also have the added excitement of winning a priceless experience for themselves or a member of their family."
Amit Sah, Commercial Bank EGM, Consumer Banking, said:"Commercial Bank is delighted by the popularity of the Manchester United Soccer School with our customers' children. Commercial Bank is always looking for proactive ways of supporting sporting activities in Qatar to promote a healthy future Qatari generation as part of the Qatar National Vision 2030." (TNN)
