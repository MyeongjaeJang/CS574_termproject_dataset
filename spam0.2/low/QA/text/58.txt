THE length of day and night will be approximately equal over all world countries on Tuesday (March 20, 2018) because the vernal equinox phenomenon will be occurring at 7:15pm (Doha local time), according to Qatar Calendar House (QCH).
This phenomenon is significant since the vernal equinox and all four astronomical seasons are an indicator for climatic changes. Moreover, on this day we can observe the exact positions of sunrise and sunset over eastern and western horizons, respectively.
Dr Beshir Marzouk, astronomer expert at QCH, said:"On this day, the length of the day and the night will be approximately equal over Qatar and all over the world. The length of day over Qatar will be 12 hours and seven minutes, while night will be 11 hours and 53 minutes long. The sunrise time over Doha sky will be at 5:38am, while sunset time will be at 5:45pm (Doha local time)."
"During astronomical vernal equinox the sun will be exactly vertical over the earth's equator; where after the vernal equinox day the apparent motion of the sun will continue to move towards the northern direction of hemisphere and lie exactly vertical over Tropic of Cancer in Northern Hemisphere on the Summer Solstice day (June 21)," Dr Marzouk added.
