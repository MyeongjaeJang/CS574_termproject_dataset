QATAR is dealing firmly with the phenomenon of terrorism by issuing legislations to tackle it and enhance the country's international cooperation in this direction, National Counter-terrorism Committee Chairman HE Maj Gen Abdulaziz Abdullah al Ansari has said.
Speaking at the opening session of the seventh conference of the International Association of Police Academies and Colleges (INTERPA), Maj Gen Ansari said Qatar has always affirmed its rejection of all acts of extremism and terrorism, and expressed its support for all legal measures aimed at eliminating them.
"Qatar has also acceded to several conventions on terrorism at the regional and international levels and concluded bilateral agreements with fraternal and friendly countries," he said.
Maj Gen Ansari also referred to Qatar's cooperation with the counter-terrorism committees across the world and its constant efforts to exchange information, expertise and technical assistance related to combating extremism and terrorism.
Since its inception in 2007, Maj Gen Ansari said, the National Counter-terrorism Committee has not been working independently of other relevant authorities in the country."When the issue of violent extremism came to light, the committee was keen to form a national working group comprising representatives of civil society and thought leaders in society to help it carry out its mandate."
This group is helping the committee in preventing the spread of extremist ideology that leads to terrorism, preventing the recruitment of individuals to terrorist groups, promoting the values of coexistence and acceptance, and proposing media awareness plans to highlight the danger of extremist ideology and its destructive effects on society, he said.
Choosing extremism and terrorism as the theme of this year's conference came after the phenomenon has become a major concern for all societies,Maj Gen Ansari added. (TNN)
