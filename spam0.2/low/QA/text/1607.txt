Pentagon planners scrambled Wednesday to find ways to support President Donald Trump’s surprise edict that he would send “military” to guard America’s southern border.
The commander-in-chief’s seemingly off-the-cuff directive blindsided officials Tuesday, when Trump said the military would guard the frontier until “we can have a wall and proper security.”
It took hours for the White House to clarify that Trump’s plan involved mobilising National Guard, and not active-duty troops, but Defence Department officials kept looking for ways to bolster border security.
“There are a number of ways the Department of Defense is already supporting the (Department of Homeland Security) border security mission,” Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said.
“We are still in consultation with the White House about ways we can expand that support.”
Legally, the Pentagon is limited in how it can help with regular troops on the border, as an 1878 act restricts how the federal government can deploy forces domestically.
The National Guard is different: each state has its own militia that can be called into action by the governor.
Federal authorities can, however, activate guardsmen to go overseas, such as during the Iraq War. Since 2006, National Guard troops have been deployed three times along the border, most recently in 2014, when Texas’s then governor Rick Perry sent his state’s militia to boost security amid an influx of young immigrants from Central America.
The National Guard did not immediately respond to a request for comment on future deployments to the border.
