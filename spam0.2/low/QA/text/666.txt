Mohammad Shahzad starred as Afghanistan laid down a marker ahead of next year's World Cup by romping to a seven-wicket thrashing of the West Indies in Sunday's qualifying final in Harare.
Leg-spin sensation Rashid Khan became the fastest bowler ever to reach 100 one-day international wickets as the Windies were bowled out for 204, before big-hitting opener Shahzad smashed 84 in his 93-ball knock with 11 fours and two sixes as Afghanistan knocked off the runs with 9.2 overs to spare.
The 16-year-old leg-spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman finished with 4-43m, including the wicket of Chris Gayle. Rovman Powell hit 44.
Rashid, 19, dismissed Shai Hope to take his 100th ODI wicket in only his 44th game, beating the previous record held by Australia's Mitchell Starc by eight matches.
Rahmat Shah struck an assured 11th ODI half-century as Afghanistan cruised to victory to lift the trophy. Both teams have already qualified for the World Cup.
