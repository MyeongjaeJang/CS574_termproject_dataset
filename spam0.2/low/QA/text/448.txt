Kane Williamson moved into sole possession of the New Zealand test century record on a rain-disrupted second day of the series opener between a dominant New Zealand and England on Friday.
Williamson, who had resumed on 91, stroked his way to an 18th test century before the teams were driven off the field for the first time on a day when a little more than 90 minutes of play was completed.
Henry Nicholls was 49 not out and wicketkeeper BJ Watling on 17 when the play was finally abandoned shortly after 9 p.m. (0800 GMT) with New Zealand on 227 for four, a lead of 171 runs.
Despite being in a fantastic position, the hosts would have undoubtedly been both bitterly disappointed and frustrated at not being able to force the game on further.
They had already taken a strong hold of the first day-night test in New Zealand in the opening 90 minutes of the match when Trent Boult and Tim Southee produced a swing bowling onslaught to dismiss the visitors for a measly 58 runs.
Williamson then dominated New Zealand's reply, showcasing all of the talents that have driven him into the record books at a faster rate than former captain Martin Crowe and current team mate Ross Taylor, who are locked on 17 centuries.
After his team resumed on 175-3, he opened his account with minimal effort when he drove Stuart Broad straight down the ground to the long-on boundary to move to 95.
He took his time to reel off the next four runs before he brought up the milestone with a characteristic late dab through gully for a single.
