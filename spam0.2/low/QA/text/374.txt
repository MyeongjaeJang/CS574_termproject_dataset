Harasta Syrian rebels and their families left Syria's Eastern Ghouta on Thursday under a Russian-brokered evacuation deal that is the first for the shrinking opposition enclave outside Damascus. They were bussed out in direction of the northwestern province of Idlib, after hours of waiting in a buffer zone for a green light to enter regime-held territory. In Idlib -- the last province in Syria beyond government control -- an air raid on a market killed 28 civilians, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
