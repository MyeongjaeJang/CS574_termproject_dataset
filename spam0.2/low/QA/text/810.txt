The 2nd Aspire Lake Festival 'Magical Journey', organised by Aspire Zone Foundation (AZF), in partnership with Ooredoo, Qatar Airways, the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy and Katara, and directed by French artist, Christophe Berthonneau, transformed the Aspire Lake into a 3D spectacle. Some of the attendees described the show as one of the best they had ever seen.
The performance told the story of a young Arab man who embarked on a journey to roam the oceans in search of a legendary pearl. He hoped the journey would help him find the secret to happiness and peace. To get to his destination, the young man, who started his magical journey from Qatar, travelled the world and overcame many obstacles such as the Chinese Dragon, mythical monsters of the African Savanna, and the giant anaconda snakes told in Amazonian folklore. After fighting many battles, the young man found that the secret to happiness and peace was in Doha all long.
The 40-minute remarkable performances were the ideal blend between two contrasting elements, water and fire. The fireworks displayed were perfectly timed to match the music that accompanied the show.
