Sydney The bans handed down to three Australian cricketers - former captain Steve Smith, his deputy David Warner and Cameron Bancroft - were"disproportionate"to the misconduct admitted, the union representing the players said Tuesday.
The penalties which followed an internal review were"disproportionate relative to precedent"while the players'"extraordinary contrition"should also be considered, Australian Cricketers'Association president Greg Dyer said Tuesday.
"Their distressed faces sent a message across the globe as effective as any sanctions could be,"Dyer said.
"I think Australia cried with Steve Smith last Thursday - I know I certainly did,"he added.
Dyer also questioned whether the proper process was followed when CA rushed Smith and Bancroft to meet the media after the match, a decision the president said was"unfair to any person in any workplace."
"Justice which is rushed can sometimes by flawed,"Dyer said.
