Heavy rains in Southern California on Thursday threatened to cause dangerous mudslides in the hills northwest of Los Angeles, after thousands of people evacuated their homes in a region where slides killed 21 people in January.
Officials in Ventura County, northwest of Los Angeles, ordered dozens of people to evacuate their homes near areas where last year's wildfires burned away grass and shrubs that normally hold soil in place and baked a hardened level of earth that keeps precipitation near the surface.
So far more than 60,000 residents of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties have been asked or ordered to leave their homes since the rains began. The storm could drench mountainsides with up to 10 inches (25 cm) of rain before it weakens on Thursday night, said National Weather Service specialist Stuart Seto.
"The storm has a lot of intensity behind it and has the potential to be life-threatening," said Amber Anderson, a spokeswoman for the Santa Barbara Fire Department."The public, for the most part, has heeded the warnings for evacuations."
In January, heavy rainfall caused a mudslide that killed 21 people and destroyed or damaged hundreds of homes, mostly around the wealthy Montecito enclave, which is about 85 miles (137 km) northwest of Los Angeles and is home to celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres.
They contend that AT&T could withhold or demand higher prices for prime television content like Time Warner unit HBO's"Game of Thrones,"or sports from Turner Broadcasting.
