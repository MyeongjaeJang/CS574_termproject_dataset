8:30 pm to 9:30 pm, the Radisson Blu Hotel Doha, turned off all non-critical electrical appliance and carried out other energy-saving measures including serving Earth Mocktails at the Manhattan lounge and Earth Hour cupcakes at the Palm Garden Cafe, for guests wishing to join the hotel in raising environmental awareness. 
An Earth Hour Pledge wall was set up where many guests wrote down their commitments to reduce, reuse and recycle. 
Adding to this, the hotels’ employees took part in this global initiative by following the Earth Hour’s unique display of darkness and switching off all lights in their accommodation, playing live unplugged songs and lighting candles in the form of the panda who is the brand mascot of the World Wildlife Fund. Also, an Earth Hour quiz was held to create additional awareness among the employees and their families. 
The hotel will continue in its efforts to take action beyond the hour, to use energy efficiently, through initiatives involving both Guests and Employees.
