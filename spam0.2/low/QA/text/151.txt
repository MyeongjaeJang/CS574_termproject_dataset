In a far-reaching move that would provide a big relief to private sector companies, the Ministry of Economy and Commerce (MEC) is studying a proposal for extending the commercial registration renewal period to five years.
Commercial Registration and Licensing Director Ayed Manahi al Qahtany said the proposal is under study at the Consultative Council. At present, a commercial registration is valid for one year and companies need to renew it within 30 days of the expiration period.
Qatar Chamber Board Member Ali Abdul Latif al Misnad said the managements of a number of companies in Qatar have been demanding for the extension of commercial registration from one year to five years."The government has almost finalised to issue commercial registration for five years and unifying expiry dates of all documents for the same period," he said.
