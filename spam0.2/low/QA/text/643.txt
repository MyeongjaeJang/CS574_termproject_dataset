QATAR Cancer Society (QCS), in collaboration with National Center for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR), organised an awareness activity as part of 'Eat Right, Live Better' campaign to raise awareness about colorectal cancer.
Nisreen Yahya, health educator at QCS, said:"The activity aimed at raising awareness about colorectal cancer, which is among the common cancers in Qatar. It is the second most common cancer in men and third among the women in Qatar. The activity also helped to broaden the public understanding about the importance of prevention and early detection of colorectal cancer. The event emphasised on screening as colorectal cancer is a non-symptomatic disease, especially in early stage."
Talking about the risk factors, Yahya said:"There are non-modifiable risk factors as age incidence and death rates for colorectal cancer increase among 50-year olds and above. Colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates are higher in men than in women." (TNN)
