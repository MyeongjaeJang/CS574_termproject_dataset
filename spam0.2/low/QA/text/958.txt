Amitabh Bachchan is in Hyderabad to shoot for superstar Chiranjeevi's Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy magnum opus, and shared with his fans a glimpse of his look test for the biopic on the late freedom fighter Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy.
"Dear friend Chiranjeevi, that majestic superstar and icon from the world of Andhra and Telugu cinema, requests a guest appearance in his magnum opus, on a most valiant period character that he portrays, and I agree," Big B posted on his blog.
He shared a photograph in which he is seen sporting a heavily white bearded look.
"These are not the final, but close," he wrote.
The 75-year-old said most people who wish for him to work in their films, attempt to put him in situations wherein he sports the look of an old man.
"Cannot really deny their choice... The days of yore are over... I mean they could never be reborn as this," he said, posting another picture in which he can be seen standing with his hands raised to the side with a group of background dancers standing next to him.
