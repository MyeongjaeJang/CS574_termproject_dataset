New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. is vowing to hold out if he doesn't receive a new contract before the season begins, according to a report by the NFL Network.
Beckham, 25, is entering the fifth and final year of his rookie deal worth $8.5 million. He is involved in ongoing talks about a contract extension with the Giants, and owner John Mara had said previously he wanted Beckham to be a Giant for life.
"WR Odell Beckham Jr will not set foot on a field without a new contract extension agreed to - with the #Giants or any team," a tweet by NFL Network reporter Ian Rapoport read in part.
The news comes after Mara admitted his disappointment with the star wide receiver at NFL owners meetings, sharing that while Beckham Jr. may not be on the trading block, he is not an"untouchable."
"I can't answer that one way or the other," Mara said."We're certainly not shopping him. Again, when you're coming off a season when you're 3-13 and played as poorly as we played, I wouldn't say that anyone is untouchable."
