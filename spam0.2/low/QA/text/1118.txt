Qatar on Friday condemned the Israeli occupation's use of live bullets on peaceful demonstrations in Gaza marking Land Day, which led to the martyrdom of a number of Palestinians and injuries to hundreds more.
In a statement on Friday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the Israeli escalation was a violation of international laws and conventions.
The statement called on the international community and the UN Security Council to shoulder their responsibility in containing the Israeli war machine and its collective punishment policy directed against the Palestinian people.
The statement also called on the international community to provide protection for the innocent civilians. It affirmed Qatar's support to the Palestinian people in exercise of all their rights, including the right to return. The statement highlighted Qatar's firm support to the Palestinian issue and the struggle of the Palestinians to guarantee the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with the 1967 borders and East Jerusalem as its capital.
