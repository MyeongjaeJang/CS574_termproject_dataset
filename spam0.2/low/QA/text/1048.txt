The United Nations' aviation agency is trying to facilitate talks between Qatar and its neighbours to defuse recent tensions over airspace violations, but won't intervene politically in the dispute, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is working to organise a regional meeting for Gulf civil aviation and air traffic authorities in the next few weeks, as part of broader efforts to improve communication, one of the sources said.
"Sometimes if you're having a feud with your neighbour you need someone to facilitate conversation," the source said.
Montreal-based ICAO cannot impose binding rules on governments, but wields clout through its safety and security standards which are approved by its 191-member countries.
ICAO spokesman Anthony Philbin said by email that the agency is"presently monitoring these incidents and working with all of the countries concerned to help keep the skies in this part of the world open, safe, and secure for international operations."
The council, however, is not planning to intervene in these latest disputes over airspace infringement, said the second source.
ICAO last year helped Qatar Airways access contingency routes over international waters, after the country's neighbours refused to allow the carrier to use their airspace.
In June, ICAO's governing council is expected to hear arguments by the Gulf states over the blockade, which Qatar is challenging, said the second source.
