Standard & Poor's (S&P) has affirmed Qatar Islamic Bank's (QIB) issuer credit rating at 'A-'
The global rating agency attributed QIB's strong rating to it being the largest Islamic bank and the second-largest market player in Qatar. QIB's sound financial performance and strong capitalisation have also contributed to S&P arriving at its decision.
"The rating reflects our views of the bank's robust corporate banking franchise and favourable position as Qatar's largest Islamic Bank," the agency, which is one of the top three in international rating, said.
"QIB's capital is strong and supports the bank's rating. QIB's funding profile is now more balanced since the bank replaced deposits from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries with core deposits from government and government-related entities in Qatar.
"QIB's stable funding ratio reached 113.9 percent at year-end 2017. The bank's liquidity is also adequate with around 7 percent of assets placed in liquid forms and another 20 percent placed mostly in Qatari government sukuk."
QIB Group CEO Bassel Gamal said,"The rating affirms the bank's success in implementing its long-term growth and performance objectives, and speak of the strength of the banking industry in Qatar."
QIB continues to record steady, healthy growth across all key performance indicators," said Bassel, adding:"In keeping with the Bank's long-term growth strategy, QIB is continuously pursuing new means to deliver real value to all its stakeholders while adhering to the highest ethical standards."
QIB has demonstrated steady financial growth over the past five years and has been setting a benchmark for Islamic banks in the region with its embrace of cutting-edge banking technologies, and its customer-centric approach to both its product offering and the overall banking experience.
QIB's reported a net profit of QR2,405 million for the fiscal year 2017 compared to QR2,155 million for the year 2016, an increase by 11.6 percent.
