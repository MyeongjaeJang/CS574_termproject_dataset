Rome: At least two Italian cities are interested in hosting the 2026 Winter Olympics, the nation's Olympic Committee (Coni) spokesman told dpa on Monday.
Coni spokesman Danilo de Tommaso did not want to reveal names but the cities are said to be the 2006 hosts Turin and Milan, which hosts next year's session of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) where the 2026 host is elected.
Di Tommaso said that Coni president Giovanni Malago would inform the IOC on Tuesday at its Swiss headquarters in Lausanne.
