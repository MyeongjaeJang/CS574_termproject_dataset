Al Naimi Takes First Superpole of the Season in Qatar Superstock 600 Posted on Comments For the first time this season, Mishal Al Naimi of Qatar got the Superpole during the fourth round of Qatar Superstock 600 held this weekend at Losail International Circuit . With very hot track conditions, Al Naimi managed to make a lap time of 2.04.383. He is starting the first row this Sunday, 1 April. It was very difficult for me from the beginning and I started very slow. I tried to push because last week I did 2.03.7 and today I tried to reach 2.04 but it was impossible. I put new tyres to see if I can improve, but the lap time was the same. In the Superpole I found something in the steering dumper, last week it was harder and today it was different, so when I make it harder I felt a big difference and I managed to make a good lap time, 2.04.3.’ Saeed Al Sulaiti will start from second place this Sunday on the grid. He said that they started the free practice with a really hot temperature, and he tried to find the right set up with the bike. He said they thought they found the solution but unfortunately, he said they were not fast enough. This Sunday, we will do some changes to feel better with the bike and we hope we can find the small click that can take us to victory. I am really happy that Abdullah will start from the first row. He was amazing and his lap timing is really fast.’ Abdullah Al Qubaisi and Nasser Al Malki will start in third and fourth place, respectively from the grid. The QSTK Race 1 starts at 11:30 am this Sunday, and Race 2 at 3:30 pm. Free entrance to the Grandstand and Paddock for all the spectators.
