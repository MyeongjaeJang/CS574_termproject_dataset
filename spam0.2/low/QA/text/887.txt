Top star Rafael Nadal could return to tennis action in next week's Davis Cup quarter-final against Germany, the Spanish tennis federation said on Tuesday.
Nadal was nominated for the April 6-8 tie on clay in a bull ring in Valencia along with David Ferrer, Pablo CarreÃ±o Busta, Roberto Bautista Agut and Feliciano Lopez by team captain Sergi Bruguera.
The 31-year-old has not played in the team event since a play-off tie in September 2016 in India and has been out of action overall since retiring in the Australian Open quarter-finals two months ago with a leg injury.
He will nonetheless return to the world number one ranking on Monday, dethroning Roger Federer, and Bruguera said he was upbeat that Nadal can feature against the Germans, although he is not expected to make his final decision until the day before the opening rubbers.
"Rafa is getting better, coming out the injury and training more. There is still a week and a half before the start of the tie, and there is time," Bruguara said.
German captain Michael Kohlmann meanwhile picked a team led led by world number five Alexander Zeverev, with Philipp Kohlschreiber returning, and Jan-Lennard Struff, Maximilian Marterer and Tim P'fctz the other players.
"We are ready for the next challenge," Kohlmann said after the Germans had prevailed in Australia in the first round.
Bruguera named Germany"the toughest opponent" they could get but Spain are unbeaten at home in the Davis Cup since 1999 and have also won the last three home ties against the Germans who however lead the overall series 10-6.
