Reinforcing its commitment to climate change action, Doha Bank, one of the largest commercial banks in the State of Qatar, showed its support for the annual Earth Hour global initiative by switching off the lights in its corporate headquarters in West Bay and various branches across Qatar for an hour (from 8.30pm to 9.30pm local time) on Saturday.
"Doha Bank is known as one of the most active advocates of corporate social responsibility (CSR), owing to the numerous green initiatives that we organise and support including the Al Dana Green Run, 'Eco-School Programme', and beach cleaning and tree planting initiatives, among others. Climate change is a real challenge for the modern world, and organisations have an important responsibility at hand to support the change towards a low-carbon emission future," said Dr R Seetharaman, CEO of Doha Bank.
"As every year, we are proud to support the global Earth Hour initiative and raise awareness about energy conservation while continuing to support and advocate our green policies across all areas of our organisation and encouraging our teams to 'reduce, reuse and recycle' to minimise resource utilisation and contribute to the efforts of saving our planet," he added.
