Singer-songwriter Nicole Scherzinger says she wants to write a musical with composer Andrew Lloyd Webber.
In the past, the 39-year-old singer left the composer"furious" when she dropped out of Cats on Broadway just one week before rehearsals to re-join The X Factor. But now Scherzinger hopes to pen a musical with Webber.
"I have several musicals in me. It would be a dream to create something original with Andrew," she told the sun.co.uk.
Webber, 70, had earlier lashed out after Scherzinger dropped out of the Broadway show with little notice.
