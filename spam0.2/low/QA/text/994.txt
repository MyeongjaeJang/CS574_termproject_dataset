With trade rumours swirling around Odell Beckham Jr., New York Giants owner John Mara is doing his best to stomp them out.
Mara told reporters on Tuesday at the NFL owner's meetings in Orlando that if he had his druthers, the Giants would not trade away their star wide receiver. However, he isn't ruling out the possibility of a trade entirely.
"Do I want him to be traded? Absolutely not," Mara said."I want him to be a Giant. I can't promise that's going to happen. We're not looking to get rid of him, OK?''
Mara added that nobody on the Giants roster, save for newly-signed left tackle Nate Solder, is considered untouchable.
"If you're asking me for a 100 percent guarantee, nobody has that," Mara said."Except maybe Nate Solder because we couldn't afford the appreciation."
If Beckham intends to hold out for a new contract, that's news to new coach Pat Shurmur. Speaking with reporters Tuesday, Shurmur said he expects Beckham to attend offseason workouts in April. NFL Network reported the 25-year-old will hold out if he doesn't receive a new contract before the season begins.
