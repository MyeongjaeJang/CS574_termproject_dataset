EXECUTIVES seeking an edge in their careers can acquire the skills needed to thrive in a rapidly evolving business world through a new range of courses offered by Georgetown University in Qatar (GU-Q).
The university's Spring 2018 range of certificate executive courses in business economics have been carefully selected and expertly designed to cater to the needs and busy schedules of working professionals.
The three certificates on offer will be taught by world-class professors from GU-Q, Qatar University and Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy.
Participants in the Certificate in Big Data Analytics course (to be held on April 15 and 17) will learn about the building blocks of Big Data and experiment with statistical and data management tools, while those in the Public-Private Partnerships course (April 15 and 16) will explore the conceptual foundations of choosing, designing and evaluating public-private partnerships.
The Certificate in Understanding Global Markets (April 18 and 19)will provide executives with the tools and intuition needed to master global markets through an in-depth analysis of the components that comprise the global financial system, allowing them to anticipate, understand, explain and respond to movements in global markets.

These courses will help professional students further develop their skills and become leaders within their organisations as they tackle the challenges of today's business environment," said Associate Professor and Director of International Economics at GU-Q Dr Alexis Antoniades.
The courses are open to junior and mid-level executives and business leaders across a range of industries. A discount on tuition fees is available for those who register before April 6, as well as Georgetown University alumni and returning executive or community education students.
