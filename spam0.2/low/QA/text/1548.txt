THE Public Works Authority (Ashghal) has been constructing 50 pedestrian bridges across the country in line with Qatar Pedestrian Crossings Master Plan (QPCMP).
"As many as 50 pedestrian bridges are at different levels of execution across Qatar. The process of identifying new pedestrian crossing locations is also progressing in cooperation with Mowasalat. Once the locations are identified, Ashghal will begin construction of the bridges," Saud al Tamimi, manager of road projects department at Ashghal, told Qatar Tribune on the sidelines of an event in Doha on Tuesday.
The QPCMP is an ambitious initiative aimed at enhancing the safety pedestrians in the country and includes 26 pedestrian overpasses and underpasses as well as 24 crosswalks on the roads. The QPCMP will contribute to safer pedestrian mobility and help provide an encouraging environment for people to walk, Tamimi said.
The QPCMP also takes into consideration the rights of all the road users, including of motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists and people with disabilities.
