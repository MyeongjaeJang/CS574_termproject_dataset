At the Asian Town Cricket Stadium in Industrial Area, Al Hamra ran up a demanding 177 for five in 20 overs through a rollicking 65 not out by Jameel. With a flurry of shots, Jameel smashed six sixes and two boundaries in his 36-ball cameo.

Jameel continued to trouble the rivals even during the chase. He grabbed two for seven, while teammates Musawir and Khalid also snared two wickets each to cause their collapse at 114 for nine.
Abrar topped the scoring for Khan Youngsters with 21, while Jasim hit three sixes to get 18 in six balls and Adnan made 17 in 25 balls.
