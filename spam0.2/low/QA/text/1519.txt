DOHA The business events of the Qatar Tourism Authority (QTA) are expected to attract 5.6 million visitors annually by 2023. Director of Exhibitions at QTA Ahmed al Obaidli said the business events sector is an important sector. He stressed that the sector plays an important role in achieving the government's direction to develop the private sector and local entrepreneurs by enabling local companies to organise events on a global level. The sector will witness significant changes during the next stage, which will lead to greater integration and flexibility between the responsible parties for this sector in Qatar, he added. QTA launched the Qatar brand as a destination for business activities two years ago to attract international exhibitions and conferences to Qatar.
