The Radisson Blu Hotel joined the global initiative organised by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) on March 24 at 8:30 pm to observe Earth Hour.
From 8:30 pm to 9:30 pm, the Radisson Blu Hotel Doha, turned off all non-critical electrical appliances and carried out other energy-saving measures including serving Earth Mocktails at the Manhattan Lounge and Earth Hour cupcakes at the Palm Garden Cafe, for guests wishing to join the hotel in raising environmental awareness.
An Earth Hour Pledge Wall was set up where many guests inscribed their commitments to reduce, reuse and recycle.
The hotel's employees took part in this global initiative by following the Earth Hour's unique display of darkness and switching off all lights in their accommodation, playing live unplugged songs and lighting candles in the form of the panda, the mascot of the World Wildlife Fund. Also an Earth Hour quiz was held to create additional awareness among the employees and their families.
The hotel will continue in its efforts to take action beyond the hour, to use energy efficiently, through initiatives involving both guests and employees.
