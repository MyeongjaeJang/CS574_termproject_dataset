Qatar Petroleum will enhance its partnerships in India, the company said in a statement on Wednesday announcing the successful conclusion of its President and CEO Saad Sherida al Kaabi's visit to New Delhi.
Kaabi, who led a delegation from QP and Qatargas to India, held talks on enhancing cooperation with top Indian energy officials, the statement said.
Kaabi's meeting with India's Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan focused on bilateral cooperation and means to strengthen energy relations with Qatar, particularly in the LNG sector.
Kaabi and the accompanying delegation also held similar talks with senior executives of Indian Oil, GAIL, Petronet and Reliance Industries.
"Qatar appreciates and values its long-term and mutually beneficial relationship with India, and reiterates its commitment to effectively contribute to satisfying India's growing energy demand, including the reliable delivery of LNG and other hydrocarbons," the statement Quote: d Kaabi as saying.
"I would like to thank the Indian government and all the executives and energy leaders we have met for their hospitality and constructive discussions. We look forward to more cooperation between our companies," the QP chief added.
India is a strategic partner for Qatar Petroleum. Its business relationship includes LNG supplies and other energy products to fuel the vibrant Indian economy.
India also represents one of Qatar's largest markets with more than 10 million tonnes delivered annually in the recent years. Qatargas supplies multiple customers in India and is the single largest LNG supplier to the country.
In 1999, RasGas (now Qatargas) and Petronet LNG Limited signed a long-term SPA for 7.5million tonnes per annum of LNG. This was followed in December 2015 with a new SPA for the supply of an additional one million tonnes per annum, raising the total annual long-term commitment between the two companies to 8.5 million tonnes per annum.
