WOQOD Vehicles Inspection (Fahes) showed its support and solidarity with its participation in the 34th Traffic Week by joining hands with General Traffic Directorate within the Ministry of the Interior initiative to bring awareness to the public regarding safe driving skills and alleviate accidents.
As part of its corporate social responsibility, Fahes actively participated on this occasion with an impressive booth at Darb Al Saai from March 18 to 24.
The Traffic Week is a key part of Qatar's commitment to improving road safety and encouraging positive behaviours as part of the National Road Safety Strategy 2013-2022. The Traffic Week is an important and unique platform to raise awareness about the issues around road safety and educating the public on their responsibilities.
'Your life is a trust' was the main theme of the week-long awareness campaign. Messages on 'safe driving' and to 'beware of others faults' were highlighted throughout the week. A focused attempt was made to increase awareness on a wide variety of traffic safety issues aimed towards making transportation safer for drivers and the general public.
Leaflets detailing inspection parameters and common FAQ's about vehicle inspection were distributed at the booths.
On this occasion, WOQOD's CEO, Eng. Saad Rashid al Muhannadi, said:"Fahes and the General Traffic Directorate have forged a strong and enduring partnership over the years, through which we remain focused on driving road safety initiatives to help achieve the goals of the National Road Safety Strategy 2013-2022. I'm proud to see our partnership strengthened further during the Traffic Week." (TNN)
