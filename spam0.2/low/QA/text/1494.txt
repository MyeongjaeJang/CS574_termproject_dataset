The Public Works Authority (Ashghal) on Tuesday signed contracts worth QR1.5 billion for the development of infrastructure for land plots under the Citizens Residential Projects in Al Wukair South.
The infrastructure required for 3,508 land plots include roads, sewage, water and electricity connections and parking areas.
Ashghal President Saad Ahmed Ibrahim al Mohannadi signed the contract with leading construction groups.
"By the end of 2024, the number of citizens' land plots to be served with infrastructure will be three times than the number of plots in 2013, which is a clear indication of the government's support to the citizens," Muhannadi said.
The projects will be completed by the second quarter (Q2) of 2020, he added.
These projects will provide an integrated infrastructure for the south of Al Wukair, as it includes the construction of 166 km of sewage networks and 310 km of storm and ground water networks.
The projects will also provide a total of 172 km of internal and external roads and 27 intersections that connect Al Wukair South with the surrounding main roads.
Works also include providing parking bays, lighting poles and directional signage to enhance traffic safety in the area.
The contractors who signed the agreements included joint venture Urba Con Trading & Contracting Co. and Infra Road Trading & Contracting (QR512 million to develop 820 land plots), and Quality Based Structures International (QR947 million for developing 2,688 land plots).
