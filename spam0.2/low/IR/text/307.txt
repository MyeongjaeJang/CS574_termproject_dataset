China ‘ready to counter malicious trade practices of US’ TEHRAN, March 29 - China has once again said that it does not favor a trade war with the United States but is prepared to counter the “malicious practices” of Washington, which has imposed hefty tariffs on particular imports from China. TEHRAN, Young Journalists Club (YJC) - Gao Feng, a spokesman for China’s Commerce Ministry, said on Thursday that Beijing would take all possible steps to protect its interests and was confident in its ability to counter the impacts of any foreign protectionist policies. He said China would continue to conduct trade practices based on domestic regulations and the principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO). US President Donald Trump announced last week that Washington would levy up to $60 billion in tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from a number of countries, including China as well as key US allies.
