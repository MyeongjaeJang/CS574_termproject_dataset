RNA - The majority of sick Palestinians are being held in the Al-Ramla Prison which is overcrowded, the group stated, adding that prisoners do not receive the necessary healthcare and treatment to deal with their condition, Middle East Monitor reported. Disabled prisoners are also unable to use the toilet and facilities without the help of other inmates, the committee explained. Rights groups said that there are about 7000 Palestinian prisoners inside 22 Israeli jails, including about 400 who have medical conditions which need treatment, 400 being held under administrative detention, 350 minors and 57 women. An Israeli court recently ruled that 15-year-old Shadi Farah can serve the remainder of his two year sentence in a juvenile centre after an Israel’s prosecution service had requested he be moved to a jail for adults. Farah was detained on 30 December 2015 and should have been released at the end of last year however the court did not take into consideration the year he spent in a jail prior to being sentenced.
