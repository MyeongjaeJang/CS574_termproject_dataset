Time : Friday, April 13, 2018 News ID: 437194 Palestinian President Condemns Attempted Torching of Mosque South of Nablus Rasa - President Mahmoud Abbas Friday condemned Israeli settlers’ attempt to torch a mosque in Aqraba village, South of Nablus. RNA - Suspected Israeli settlers early Friday vandalized and poured flammable materials at the entrance of Sheikh Sa'adeh mosque and spray-painted “Death” and “price tag” on its external walls in Hebrew, WAFA reported. Pictures of the aftermath show apparent fire and smoke damage to the front door. No one was hurt in the attack though. Abbas stated that Israeli settlers have repeatedly torched mosques and churches across the occupied Palestinian territories, which underlies the fact that “such serious crimes are committed by terrorist settlers under the Israeli forces’ nose and protection.” He stressed that his office would approach all relevant international institutions to ensure these “terrorists” are punished and protection is provided to the Palestinian people and religious sites. Meanwhile, Minister of Waqf and Religious Affairs Yousef Id'eis stated that settlers’“terrorist” actions against Palestinians were “consistent with” Israeli systematic incitement against the Palestinian people and leadership. “The Israeli government’s inflammatory measures and justifications of (such terrorist) acts will draw the region into a religious war,” he warned.
