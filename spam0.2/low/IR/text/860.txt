The senior Uzbek official made the remarks during the 12th meeting of Iran-Uzbekistan joint economic committee at the place of Iran Trade Promotion Organization (TPO) in Tehran. 
Referring to $325 million Iran-Uzbekistan annual trade, Ramatov lamented that the value does not accord with the two countries’ capacities and capabilities. 
“Uzbekistan is ready to annually import one million tons of oil products from Iran and will reach the figure up to three million tons in future,” he added. 
Expansion of transportation and transit of goods between the two countries can bring both sides profit, he said, “Iran and Uzbekistan transited 911,000 tons of goods last year.” Iranian Minister of Industry, Mining and Trade Mohammad Shariatmadari, who also attended the committee, named free trade as the factor which facilitates economic and commercial ties with Uzbekistan. 
He also underscored the vitality of easing common customs ties besides formation of a transportation joint committee. 
“Iran is ready to share its experiences in construction of hydro power plants as well as wind and solar farms as well as agricultural machineries, electricity and water distribution networks and modern construction materials with Uzbekistan,” he added.
