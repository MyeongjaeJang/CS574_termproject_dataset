The widespread geographical scope of the horrific incidents shows that terrorism is a global problem which requires global solutions, he said, adding, “uprooting the ideological and financial resources of terrorism is the sole way to get rid of this phenomenon which threatens the global peace and security.”

In another terrorist attack on the same day, a car bomb explosion near a sports facility in southern Afghanistan killed at least 15, leaving more than 50 others injured. 
This is while Egyptian media outlets said that a powerful blast rocked the city of Alexandria in north central part of the country on Saturday.
