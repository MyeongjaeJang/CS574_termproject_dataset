THE HAGUE, Apr. 11 (MNA) – The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) announced it will send a fact-finding mission to Douma town in Damascus Countryside in order to investigate allegations of alleged use of chemical weapons there. 
The move comes upon a request by Syria and Russia to launch an international investigation. 
“Since the first reports of alleged use of chemical weapons in Douma were issued, the OPCW has been gathering information from all available sources and analyzing it,” the Organization said in a statement on Tuesday. 
“At the same time, OPCW’s Director General, Ambassador Ahmet Uzumcu, has considered the deployment of a Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) team in Douma to establish facts surrounding these allegations,” the statement reads. 
The statement added, “Today, the OPCW Technical Secretariat has requested the Syrian Arab Republic to make the necessary arrangements for such a deployment. This has coincided with a request from the Syrian Arab Republic and the Russian Federation to investigate the allegations of chemical weapons use in Douma. The team is preparing to deploy to Syria shortly.”
