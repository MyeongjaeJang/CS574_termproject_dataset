Time : Sunday, March 18, 2018 News ID: 436909 Hundreds of Israeli Forces Deployed in Iraq Rasa - Arab media reports disclosed presence of hundreds of covert Israeli troops in Iraq, saying that they are conducting special terrorist operations in the country. RNA - The Arabic-language Palestinian al-Manar newspaper quoted an Iraqi source as saying that 250 to 300 Israeli soldiers are stationed at Taji military base, North of Baghdad, using American or Canadian passports to conceal their real identity. Observers believe that the soldiers are indeed missioned to conduct terrorist operations and assassinate Iraqi figures, including Hashd al-Shaabi (Iraqi popular forces) commanders. The report also referred to the presence of Zionists in Iraq within the framework of different electronic firms, including Tadiran company, to implement security projects, warning of Israel's dangerous plots against Iraq's unity. Israel has not played a direct role in the US-led coalition's campaign in Iraq but evidence in recent years has shown that it has supplied weapons to the terrorist groups. According to Fars News Agency, the Iraqi army discovered nearly a dozen depots of Israeli-made arms and ammunition in Diyala province, local officials disclosed in 2014. "An Iraqi army unit has found around 10 weapons and munition depots where Israel-made weapons and explosives were kept in Hamrin mountains," Sadeq Al-Moussavi, a member of Diyala provincial council, said at the time. Moussavi said that the depot contained a lot of explosives, weapons and bombs all made by Israel.
