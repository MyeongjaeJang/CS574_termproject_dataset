Americans after boosting terrorists’ morale in Syria: MP News ID: 4272649   Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the Chairman of Iran's Parliament National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, described the trilateral aggression in Syria as a measure to boost terrorists’ morale. 
“The attack was carried out with the aim to boost the terrorists’ morale,” said Alaeddin Boroujerdi, the Chairman of Iran's Parliament National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, on Monday. 
He made the remarks on the sidelines of visiting Iran’s Standard Organization in Karaj, condemning the trilateral aggression of US, UK, and France in Syria. 
“The Americans were the main plotters of the imposed war in Syria in the last 7 years as they are accompanying the Zionist regime and some European allies in an attempt to create crisis in and destabilize the region,” he said while addressing reporters. 
“After losing ground in Iraq, they trained thousands of terrorists from around the world to change the political system in Syria through a proxy war,” asserted the senior lawmaker. 
“After 7 years, the output of this campaign has been a total failure and they have failed to meet their objectives and it is very hard for a self-proclaimed super-power of the world to admit the bitter defeat,” said the Iranian MP. 
“US, along with France and UK, designed and carried out an attack in Syria which aimed to save their face and boost terrorists’ morale but it resulted nothing than loss of face for them,” reiterated Mr. Boroujerdi.
