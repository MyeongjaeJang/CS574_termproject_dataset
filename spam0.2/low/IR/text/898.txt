Assad: US aggression strengthens resistance of Syrian people, govt. News ID: 4270704 - Politics TEHRAN, Apr. 14 (MNA) – In a telephone contact with the Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Saturday, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad talked about the recent military move taken by US and its allies including France and UK on Syrian land and territory and said, “this military invasion will increase the will and determination of Syrian government and people in the fight against terrorism and its destruction throughout Syria.” 
This military invasion showed that western and colonial countries supporting terrorism have lost their control, Assad maintained. 
These countries have lost their credibility in the face of their nations and the whole world, he said, adding, “US along with its allies including UK and France waged military attack against Syria after the complete defeat of terrorists in Syria, so that these countries entered the war with Syria directly.” 
Accordingly, US along with its key allies [UK and France] attacked Damascus and Homs in Syria today morning, based on which, all missiles shot by aggressors were toppled down in 24 km west part of Syria’s Homs province. 
In the wake of US chemical attack on Syria, Foreign Ministry of Syria submitted an official invitation letter to the Organization for Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and requested the Organization to send its inspectors and research teams to Syria’s Douma over the use of chemical weapons. 
Syrian government dismissed any intervention in the chemical attack in a way that Russia’s UN envoy also rejected the use of chemical attack by Syrian government, claiming it as heinous move taken by terrorists.
