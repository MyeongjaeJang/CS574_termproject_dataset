Time : Tuesday, April 10, 2018 News ID: 437162 Saudi Arabia No Longer Safe from Yemeni Missiles: Official Rasa – The president of Yemen’s Supreme Political Council warned that more ballistic missiles will be fired at Saudi Arabia in the current year, stressing that the kingdom is no longer safe country as Yemeni missiles can now hit anywhere in that country. 
RNA - “This year will be the year of all types of ballistic missiles,” Saleh al-Samad said on Tuesday, addressing a huge gathering in Sana’a as the Saudi military aggression against the impoverished Arab country has entered the fourth year. 

Saudi air defense systems are incapable of repelling Yemeni missiles, he stressed, adding that Riyadh “will not be safe from our missiles” as they can reach anywhere in Saudi Arabia. 

Earlier in the day, Yemen’s army and Popular Committees targeted gatherings of Saudi troops in Jizan in southern Saudi Arabia with a homegrown ballistic missile dubbed “Qaher M2” in retaliation for the continued massacre of civilians by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. 

According to Tasnim News Agency, Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia and some of its Arab allies have been carrying out deadly airstrikes against the Houthi Ansarullah movement in an attempt to restore power to fugitive former president Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, a close ally of Riyadh. 

Over 14,000 Yemenis, including thousands of women and children, have lost their lives in the deadly military campaign.
