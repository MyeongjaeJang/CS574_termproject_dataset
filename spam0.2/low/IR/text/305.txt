Politics March 25, 2018 The Iranian nation’s allegiance to the Islamic Revolution’s goals and legacy of devotion left by the Sacred Defense would guarantee defeat of the US and termination of the Israeli regime in less than 25 years, Iran's Army chief said. 
Speaking to Tasnim in Iran’s southwestern province of Khuzestan on Saturday, Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi highlighted the role of the Sacred Defense values in Iran’s deterrent power, saying the “criminal US and the illegitimate Zionist regime” of Israel are afraid of Iranian allegiance to the goals of Revolution. 
Warning against the hostile attempts to undermine public interest in cultural plans in commemoration of Iran’s defense during eight years of Iraqi imposed war, the general underlined that Iran, empowered by the Sacred Defense and the popular support for the national goals, will crush the US and see the Israeli regime terminated in less than 25 years. 
On various occasions, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei has stressed the need for efforts to keep alive memories of the Sacred Defense, the 8-year Iraqi imposed war in the 1980s. 
Every year during the new Iranian year’s holidays, many people travel to the country’s border areas that used to be war zones in the Sacred Defense era. 
The annual excursions are part of a broad cultural program in Iran to familiarize people, particularly the young generation, with the Iranian soldiers’ bravery during eight years of war imposed on Iran by Iraq under former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
