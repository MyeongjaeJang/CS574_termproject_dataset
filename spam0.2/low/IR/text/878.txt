Alleged chemical attack must be investigated by UN News ID: 4271311 - Politics TEHRAN, Apr. 15 (MNA) – Chinese Ambassador to Tehran, Pang Sen, said Sun. that the alleged chemical attack in Syria must have been first investigated by the United Nations before any country took any measures in response. 
The Chinese ambassador made the comment while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting of a member of China’s Foreign Policy Advisory Committee with Senior adviser to Iranian Leader Ali Akbar Velayati in Tehran on Sunday. 
“China believes that all countries must respect the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of each other,” he said. “We are against any measure that is taken outside the framework of the United Nations, and consider it a violation of international law.” 
“Such measures will further complicate the situation in Syria,” Mr. Pang Sen said about the recent airstrikes on Syria carried out by the US, Britain and France. “China calls on the involved parties to pursue the issue through talks and the UN mechanism.” 
He went on to add, “China considers a political solution as appropriate for settling the Syrian crisis. The International community also needs to resolve the Syrian issue through peaceful means and within the UN framework.”
