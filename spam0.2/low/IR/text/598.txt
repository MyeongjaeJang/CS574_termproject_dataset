Time : Friday, April 6, 2018 News ID: 437125 UN High Commissioner: Israeli Soldiers Use Excessive Force against Palestinians Rasa - Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Liz Throssell said on Friday there are strong indications that Israeli forces used excessive force last Friday, resulting in the killing of at least 16 Palestinians and the injury of more than 1,000 others. RNA - “Given the deplorable killing of (at least) 16 people and the injuring of reportedly more than 1,000 others during protests in Gaza, mostly on 30 March, we are gravely concerned that further violence could occur during demonstrations today and in the coming weeks,” Throssel said, WAFA reported. “Given the large number of injuries and deaths, the ominous statements made by Israeli authorities in the days leading up to the protest, as well as indications that the individuals killed or wounded were unarmed or did not pose a serious threat to well-protected security forces – and in some cases were actually running away from the fence – there are strong indications that security forces used excessive force,” she continued. Throssel reminded Israel of its obligations to ensure that excessive force is not employed against protestors “and that in the context of a military occupation, as is the case in Gaza, the unjustified and unlawful recourse to firearms by law enforcement resulting in death may amount to a willful killing, a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention.” “We echo the call by the UN Secretary-General for an independent and transparent investigation into these incidents, with a view to holding accountable those responsible.”
