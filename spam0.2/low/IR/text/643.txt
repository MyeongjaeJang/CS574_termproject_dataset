"The Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran will defend their interests in the region powerfully and mightily and will confront any provocative and destabilizing behavior in the region decisively and wisely," he added. In relevant remarks in March, General Rashid warned the US and Israel that they cannot bear the costs and consequences of confrontation against Iran. "At present, the development and deepening of Iran's regional power has made any decision to confront the Islamic Republic difficult which will be followed by unimaginable costs," he said. "Today, the Zionist regime has more than the past understood the Islamic Republic of Iran's power in the region and will avoid testing it because it cannot manage confrontation against Iran and cannot bear its costs," the Iranian General added. According to Fars News Agancy, general Rashid also advised the US to avoid sinking in a quagmire which is the result of policies to create crisis and wage military war by Israel.
