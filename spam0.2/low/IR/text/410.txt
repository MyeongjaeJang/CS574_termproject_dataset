An Israeli spy drone has reportedly crashed in southern Lebanon as the Tel Aviv regime defies calls to end its violations of the Lebanese airspace.
Lebanon’s al-Manar television network reported that the “unmanned Israeli spy plane” had went down between the villages of Beit Yahoun and Bara’achit overnight between Friday and Saturday.
The Israeli army also confirmed the incident, with its spokesperson saying in a statement that the drone had crashed in an open field in southern Lebanon as result of a technical malfunction.
“The incident is currently being reviewed. There is no risk of leaked information,” the statement read.
Meanwhile, a security source said the Lebanese Army Engineering Corps had found four rockets inside the wreckage of the Israeli plane and would proceed to detonate them.
The Israeli regime has been violating Lebanese airspace on an almost daily basis, carrying out what it calls “routine reconnaissance missions.”
