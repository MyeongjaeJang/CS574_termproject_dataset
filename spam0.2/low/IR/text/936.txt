  437224 Comey: Trump 'Morally Unfit' to Be President Rasa - Former FBI director James Comey accused US President Donald Trump of being “morally unfit” to be president and treating women like “meat” in his first television interview in support of his new book, A Higher Loyalty. RNA - Comey further described Trump as a “stain” on everyone who worked for him, according to a transcript of a five-hour interview published by ABC. Yet Comey said he does not wish for Trump’s impeachment because that “would let the American people off the hook”, adding that “People in this country need to stand up and go to the voting booth and vote their values. And impeachment in a way would short-circuit that". “Our President must embody respect and adhere to the values that are at the core of this country,” Comey told George Stephanopolous, saying “The most important being truth. This President is not able to do that. He is morally unfit to be President”. Replying to a question about whether Trump had committed an obstruction of justice, Comey said “it’s possible”. “There’s certainly some evidence of obstruction of justice,” Comey added. But for the president to follow through on threats to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, Comey said, would “set off alarm bells that this is his most serious attack yet on the rule of law". According to Fars News Agancy, in his book, Comey compares Trump to a mafia don and challenges the President’s character, honesty and commitment to public service. A one-hour edited version of the interview with George Stephanopolous aired on ABC News on Sunday night. The White House did not reply to a query about whether Trump planned to watch the Comey interview, which was taped earlier in the week. Trump did not tweet during the broadcast.
