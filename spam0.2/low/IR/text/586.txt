Time : Friday, April 6, 2018 News ID: 437114 Karbala Friday Prayer Leader: Iraqis must commit to peaceful coexistence Rasa – Hujjat al-Islam al-Karbala’i stressed the importance of peaceful coexistence between the components of Iraqi society in light of the current situation that Iraq is going through in order to thwart the enemies’ plans to create strife in the war-torn Arab country. RNA – During his Friday prayer sermon delivered to a large and fervent crowd of believers in the Iraqi holy city of Karbala’s Holy Shrine of Imam al-Husayn, Hujjat al-Islam Abdul-Mahdi al-Karbala’i said one of the important issues in Iraq is to give consideration to the peaceful life of the various components of Iraqi society and noted, “Given the current circumstances facing Iraq, we must give plenty of attention to the issue of a peaceful life among the various groups of people in the country.” The representative of Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali al-Sistani in Karbala said, “Some assume that true and honest Shi’ism is explaining the beliefs of the school of thought of the Ahlul-Bayt alongside confrontation with others. Also, a factor for maintaining the identity of Shi’ism and protecting the school of thought of the Infallible Imams is the emigration of those who oppose this school of thought.” Hujjat al-Islam al-Karbala’i added, “By studying the lifestyle of the Ahlul-Bayt, we will learn the correct methods of introducing Shi’ism. The true school of thought must be based on proof and argument and the observance of the laws of living peacefully with others.” The Iraqi scholar stated, “We must act in a correct manner with others, participate in their celebrations, protect our tongues from defaming them and avoid any action harmful to peace so that we can stand against the enemies and those who look at this country and its wealth with evil eyes and maintain our unity.” He said that some also assume that a true Shi’ah is one who expresses love, reverence, affection, grief on sad occasions, joy on the birth anniversaries [of the Ahlul-Bayt], holding numerous mourning commemorations and pilgrimage to the graves of the Infallible Imams but all of these issues are is not enough to declare the acceptance of the guardianship of the Ahlul-Bayt because issues such as the scientific awakening and sufficient knowledge regarding the Quran and prophetic traditions also exist. “All of this is important, but it is not the essence of the Shi’ah school of thought and we have to gather together the knowledge, practice, belief, rituals and worship in a correct manner,” His Eminence added.
