Kirkuk's temporary governor calls for Iran’s investment News ID: 4270102 - TEHRAN, Apr. 13 (MNA) – Rakan Saeed Ali al-Jabouri in a meeting with Iranian ambassador to Iraq called on Iranian companies to return to Kirkuk province to resume their activities. 
Kirkuk temporary provincial governor met with Iran’s Ambassador to Iraq Iraj Masjedi in Baghdad yesterday. 
During the meeting the two sides discussed latest developments in Iraq as well as bilateral cooperation and the ways to enhance it. 
Al-Jubouri called on Iranian companies to resume their activities in the province to help rebuild the province. He called for investment in electricity, water and sewage sectors. 
Oil-rich province of Kirkuk is a disputed area between Iraqi central government and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). On October 16, 2017, Iraqi forces regained full control of the province from the Kurdish Peshmerga forces soon after the Kurdish authorities held the controversial independence referendum. Since then, Baghdad has taken serious steps to establish security and revive political and economic life in the strategic Iraqi province.
