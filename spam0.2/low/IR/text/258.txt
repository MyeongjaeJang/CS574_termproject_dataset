Time : Monday, March 26, 2018 News ID: 436997 Iranian Envoy Lauds Iraq’s Nujaba Movement Rasa – Iranian Ambassador to Baghdad Iraj Masjedi hailed the braveries of the fighters of al-Nujaba Movement, a major Shiite resistance group in Iraq, as “sources of pride” for both the Iraqi and Iranian nations. RNA - Speaking at a meeting in Baghdad with Sheikh Akram al-Kaabi, the secretary general of al-Nujaba Movement, Masjedi praised the influential role of the movement’s fighters in Iraq and Syria. “The measures and approaches of the Islamic resistance group al-Nujaba are sources of pride for Iraqis and even for Iranians,” he said. The Islamic Republic of Iran will continue its support for regional countries and help them foil the enemies’ conspiracies, he added. Sheikh Kaabi, for his part, emphasized that global capacities should be tapped and the international community should side with Iran, Iraq and resistance groups to eradicate terrorism and its sponsors. In recent years, the Middle East has been plagued with Takfiri terrorist groups like Daesh (ISIL or ISIS), which are believed to have been created and supported by the West and some regional Arab countries. According to Tasnim News Agency, the terrorist groups, which claim to be Islamic but whose actions are anything but, have been committing heinous crimes not only against non-Muslims but mostly against Muslims in the region. Iraq and Syria have been among the countries gripped by terrorism. Iran, a close ally of the two countries, has supported their legitimate governments and the nations in their campaign against foreign-backed militancy and terrorism.
