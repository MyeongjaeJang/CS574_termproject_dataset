Trump dials back on bellicose rhetoric against Syria News ID: 4269816 - Politics TEHRAN, Apr. 12 (MNA) – In a new tweet on Thu., US President Donald Trump dialed back on his earlier belligerent rhetoric against Syria, claiming that an attack on Syria may not take place. 
Donald Trump continued his ‘Twitter diplomacy’ on Thursday to add that there is no timetable for attacking Syria. 
“Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all!” He tweeted 23 hours after warning Moscow of imminent military action in Syria, telling Russia to prepare for "nice and new and 'smart!'" missile attacks in Syria in response to an alleged chemical attack on Douma in Eastern Ghouta. 
In response to Trump's bellicose tweet on Wednesday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, "smart missiles should fly towards terrorists, not [Syria's] lawful government, which has spent several years fighting against international terrorism on its territory." 
Meanwhile, Syrian President Bashar Assad warned in a meeting with Iran’s Ali Akbar Velayati on Thursday that threats of Western military action in response to an alleged chemical attack would only lead to further chaos in the region. 
Velayati has stressed that Iran would strongly defend Syria's territorial integrity and national sovereignty against any military aggression.
