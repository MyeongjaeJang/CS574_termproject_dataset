Trump softens his tone on Russia within minutes News ID: 4269223 - Politics TEHRAN, Apr. 11 (MNA) – US President Donald Trump has scaled back from his position this morning, suggesting Russia working together and ending an arm race. 
Just this morning, Donald Trump threatened to attack Syria but now he retreated from his morning’s position only 40 minutes later calling for cooperation between Moscow and Washington, working together between them, and ending what he called an “armed race.” 
Trump had earlier tweeted “Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and “smart!” You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!” 
But the United States president tweeted a little bit later today saying “our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?”
