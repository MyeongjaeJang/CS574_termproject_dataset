  437182 Leader of Hezbollah Al-Nujaba Warns Trump to Take Lesson from Terrorists' Fate in Syria Rasa - Secretary-general of Iraq's al-Nujaba popular movement Sheikh Akram condemned US President Donald Trump for his recent threats against Syria, warning that Washington will be defeated in Syria like the US-backed terrorists. RNA - "We are witnessing that Trump is attempting to make up for his failures and support terrorism directly after terrorism was defeated in Iraq and Syria and the US measures to maintain the ISIL in Syria near Albu Kamal and in Iraq in Wadi al-Houran were disclosed," al-Kaabi said on Thursday. He stressed that Trump's foreign policy is based on promotion of terrorism, massacre of nations and plundering the countries, saying, "We are waiting for you in Syria and we will gain victory in fighting against you as we did against the terrorists supported by you, including the ISIL, al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front or the Levant Liberation Board) and other Takfiri groups." Washington is weighing a military response after several media outlets reported, citing militants, that the Syrian authorities had used chemical weapons against civilians in the city of Douma in Eastern Ghouta of Damascus, with the infamous White Helmets posting unverified pictures and videos allegedly showing the aftermath of the chlorine gas attack. The United States immediately accused Damascus of the attack and threatened Syria with military intervention. Moscow immediately responded to Trump's threat on Russia who warned that the main Damascus ally should get ready to shoot down missiles fired at Syria, saying Washington should target terrorist groups in the war-torn country. According to Fars Nesw Agancy, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova retaliated to the US President's Wednesday tweets, claiming relations with Moscow were worse than during the Cold War, and threatening a direct attack on Syria following an alleged chemical attack in Douma in Damascus countryside. Zakharova wrote on Facebook "smart missiles should be fired at terrorists rather than legitimate government that has fought int'l terrorism on its territory for years". She added that any strike could be a possible attempt to cover up the evidence proving there had been no chemical attack in Douma.
