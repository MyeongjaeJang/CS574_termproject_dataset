Time : Sunday, April 8, 2018 News ID: 437138 Report: Israel to Build 5,700 Illegal Settlements Rasa - The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) said on Saturday Israel's Jerusalem Municipality approved a decision to build 5,700 illegal settlements. RNA - The new settlements will be able to accommodate 20,000 people, according to a report by the organization's National Office of Defending Land and Tackling Settlement, Anadolu Agency reported. The settlement units will be built near Wadi Fukin, Southwest of Bethlehem. The report claims 1,450 settlement units are planned to be established between Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Also, 2,645 units are expected to receive approval in the future. The illegal settlement plans have drastically increased since the US recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, the report added. Last December, US President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israelâ€™s capital, drawing widespread condemnation from across the region and angry protests in the Palestinian territories. Jerusalem remains at the heart of the Middle East conflict, with Palestinians hoping that East Jerusalem -- occupied by Israel since 1967 -- might eventually serve as the capital of a Palestinian state. International law views the West Bank and East Jerusalem as "occupied territories" and considers all Jewish settlement-building activity on the land as illegal.
