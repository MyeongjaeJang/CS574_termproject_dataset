US, France, UK military attack on Syria, a move to save Trump face News ID: 4270660 - Politics TEHRAN, Apr. 14 (MNA) – Secretary of Expediency Council Mohsen Rezaei in his reaction to the recent military attack of US, France and UK on Syrian positions today early in the morning wrote in his twitter account, “a limited attack after a week threat was a move to safe tarnished face of the US President Donald Trump.” 
This limited attack cannot compensate for US failure after the complete defeat of terrorists in Aleppo and full liberation of Eastern Ghouta in Syria, Rezaei said, adding, “US heinous act shows that US has no effective military option in Syria.” 
The firm position of Russia, lack of support of many European countries and the possibility of Hezbollah’s serious damage to Israel frustrated all hopes of US President Trump, he said, adding, “it is time for Trump to follow up a political solution in Syria, for, continuation of war in Syria will cost dearly for the US and people of the region.” 
In conclusion, Secretary of Expediency Council Mohsen Rezaei reiterated, “today’s military attacks of US along with its allies including France and UK on Syria showed that US military has been weakened militarily more than before.”
