  437229 Human Rights Official: Missile Strikes against Syria Proves US-Led Coalition's Support for Terrorism Rasa - Secretary of Iran's Human Rights Council Mohammad Javad Larijani blasted the Saturday US-led missile strikes against Syria, describing it as an indication of Washington and its allies' support for the terrorist groups. RNA - "This aggression shows the major defeats that the resistance front has inflicted on the terrorist policies of these countries," Larijani said on Monday. He added that the missile strikes indicated that the resistance front has hit a heavy blow to the root causes of terrorism and the ISIL which has been an instrument at the service of the US strategy against the region throughout the last decade. The US, Britain and France launched missile strikes on a number of targets in Syria in response to an alleged chemical attack in the Damascus' suburb of Douma, Eastern Ghouta, which has been blamed on Damascus despite the launch of a probe into the incident. According to Fars News Agancy, Moscow has stated that it had proof that the "chemical attack" in Douma had been a provocation and had been staged by Western-backed NGOs, including the White Helmets. The attack that took place before a UN team of experts started their investigations into the alleged gas attack has angered members of the UN Security Council as it was done outside the framework and charter of the UN body. "Such acts of war that are done with full disrespect for international law and the views of other UN Security Council members only undermine the role of the Council and are utter disrespect for other Council members, including China," political analyst Seyed Mostafa Khoshcheshm said. "Hence, other council members and the UN are needed to take tough action against the attack as a flagrant violation of international law," he added.
