Trilateral aggression in Syria, US political bankruptcy: Salehi News ID: 4272564   Ali Akbar Salehi, the Head of AEOI said on Monday in Tehran that the tripartite missile attack on Syria by US, UK, and France demonstrated the political bankruptcy of US. 
“The trilateral missile attack on Syria by US, UK, and France demonstrated the political bankruptcy of US,” said Ali Akbar Salehi, the Head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) on Monday in Tehran. He made the remarks addressing the media on the sidelines of the ceremony to unveil his book of memoirs, ‘A Survey in History’. 
“US and some European countries which accompanied it carried out the attack with no objective piece of evidence and it reminds us of what happened in Iraq,” he added. 
“Colin Powell presented fabricated documents at UN and claimed that Iraq had bought Uranium from Niger for non-peaceful purposes,” he recounted how US convinced the world for its 2003 attack on Iraq. 
“After two years of plowing Iraq for WMD, it turned out that the documents were fake and it was a political scandal for US,” Mr. Salehi asserted. 
“US and its confederates were unable to justify the reason of their attack on Syria and they are speaking paradoxically. The recent attack had an advantage that awakened the nations; People found out the real nature of arrogant countries,” he said.
