RNA - According to a report carried by Yemen’s official Saba news agency, Saudi jets on Monday conducted three raids against refugee camps in al-Hali and Ras mountain districts in the western coastal province of Hudaydah, an official told Saba on Monday. Dozens of civilians, including men and women, were killed during the raids. A recent strike on the same area also left 14 people dead and nine others injured there. The victims were all from the same family. There were seven children among the deceased. According to Tasnim News Agancy, Yemen’s defenseless people have been under massive attacks by the coalition for more than two years but Riyadh has reached none of its objectives in Yemen so far. Since March 2015, Saudi Arabia and some of its Arab allies have been carrying out deadly airstrikes against the Houthi Ansarullah movement in an attempt to restore power to fugitive former President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi, a close ally of Riyadh. Over 14,000 Yemenis, including thousands of women and children, have lost their lives in the deadly military campaign.
