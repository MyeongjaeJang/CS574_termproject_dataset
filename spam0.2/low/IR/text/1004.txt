Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov called on the European states not to surrender to the US pressures to review or discard the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and the P5+1 group of countries.
"Russia's policy is still based on supporting and maintaining the nuclear deal and no change will be made in that respect," Ryabkov said in a meeting with Iranian Ambassador to Moscow Mehdi Sanaei on Tuesday.
"Europe is expected to remain committed to its undertakings to the nuclear deal and logically expected to try to maintain the agreement and not surrender to the US demands," he added.
During the meeting, the two diplomats also underlined the need for resolving the crises in the region and Syria through political talks.
Sanaei also held a separate meeting with Sergei Vershinin, another Russian deputy foreign minister.
During the meeting, the Iranian envoy underscored the necessity for holding intensive consultations between Tehran and Moscow in the current conditions.
Iran announced on Monday that the US "fix-it-or-nix-it" approach towards the nuclear deal would end up nowhere but entailing dearly costs for the White House as no other option is on the table with this done deal.
"Europe and Iran are committed to the nuclear deal and Iran will not be the first party to withdraw from the agreement and will monitor the developments fully vigilantly." Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi told reporters in his weekly press conference in Tehran.
"There is no way for the nuclear deal to be reviewed and it came into action with the backup of the 2231 resolution," he added.
Qassemi once again warned the US and other countries willing to discard the deal, promising that they will be the losers.
