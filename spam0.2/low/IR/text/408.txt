Time : Saturday, March 31, 2018 News ID: 437046 Thousands of Iraqis Protest against Saudi Crown Prince's Planned Visit Rasa - Thousands of Iraqis staged a protest rally in the Iraqi capital city of Baghdad to voice their opposition to an upcoming visit by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman. RNA - Protesters gathered in Baghdad after Friday prayers, carrying signs calling bin Salman a war criminal and accusing Saudi Arabia of supporting ISIL and al-Qaeda Takfiri terrorists in their country, press tv reported. The rally was organized by the Iraqi Hezbollah Brigades, which is one of the groups that fought against ISIL. According to the office of Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, the Saudi crown prince plans to visit Iraq in the near future, but no date has been set yet. The Saudi crown prince is already on a trip to the US during which he has met the leaders of a number of pro-Israeli lobbying groups as the kingdom is moving towards normalization of diplomatic relations with Israel. Bin Salman's planned visit comes as the governments in Baghdad and Riyadh seek to mend their ties which have been strained for a long time. Abadi visited Riyadh in June last year after diplomatic relations between the two countries were restored in 2016.
