Passive Defense Org. slams Douma chemical attack News ID: 4272108 - Politics   Iran’s Passive Defense Organization and the Chemical Defense Base have issued a statement in condemnation of a chemical attack carried out by armed terrorists in the Syrian city of Douma. 
The statement noted the “unequal and unjust” war imposed by the US and its allies against Syria, which has also been receiving "direct financial, military and logistical support from the Saudi regime and some other regional and trans-regional powers." 
The statement described the chemical attack as a “clear example of crimes against humanity” and “war crimes” carried out by terrorists, in which the defenseless civilians of Douma were targeted and killed. 
“Those who have cooked up a suspicious and dangerous scenario today about the use of chemical weapons in Syria are the ones who not only ignored the use of weapons of mass destruction and banned chemical weapons against Iranian civilians and soldiers during the Iran-Iraq war, but they were also involved in arming and providing full-scale support to the criminal regime of Saddam,” the statement added. 
The Passive Defense Organization of Iran went on to strongly condemn the use or the threat to use weapons of mass destruction including chemical weapons, as well as restoring to this tactic as a pretext to carry out illegal measures against independent nations and governments.
