  437231 US-Led Syria Strike Contravenes Int’l Law: Iran’s Top Judge Rasa - In comments at a weekly session of top judiciary officials on Monday, Ayatollah Amoli Larijani condemned the Saturday’s missile strikes launched by the US, Britain and France against Syria, saying the attack was in contravention of the international, moral and humanitarian norms. RNA - The US and its allies have mocked the international regulations by attacking Syria under the “false and repetitious” pretext that chemical weapons have been used there, the Iranian judge deplored. He also noted that such criminal strike strengthens unity among Muslims and demonstrates that the US and its allies are not reliable at all. Rejecting the US “excessive demands” and its push for talks on Iran’s missile power, Ayatollah Amoli Larijani said Washington should not expect to negotiate with Iran or win trust from the Muslim nations after breaching the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and attacking Syria. The US and its allies take military action against Syria whenever their mercenaries suffer defeats in the face of the Syrian Army, he added. According to Tasnim News Agancy, in the early hours of Saturday, the three Western states launched a barrage of missile attacks against Syria in response to what they claim to be a chemical attack in Douma. Syria has rejected any role in the suspected gas attack. In comments made a few hours after the US-led attack on Syria, Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei deplored it as “a crime”, calling the presidents of the US and France as well as the British prime minister “criminals”.
