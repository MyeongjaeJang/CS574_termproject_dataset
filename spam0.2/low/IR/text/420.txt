Saudi crown prince meeting stars from Elon Musk, Bill Gates to Oprah News ID: 4261265 - Opinion > Op-Ed   young Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, is spending a long time in US meeting with many American stars and here is a report on the visit rolled out by Business Insider. 
Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is currently on a multi-week tour across US, meeting with heavy hitters in government, business, and the media. 
Starting with President Donald Trump, MbS, as he is known, has since gone on to meet other important politicians in Washington, including influential members of Congress and a number of Trump Cabinet officials. 
But the crown prince isn't just meeting with politicians. The Independent reported that a leaked copy of his itinerary revealed meetings with journalists, media moguls, academics, and some of the biggest players in the world's economy. 
Here are some of the biggest names MbS is meeting during his charm offensive: 
Donald Trump 
Trump has now met with MbS multiple times, both in US and Saudi Arabia. He has emerged as a strong supporter of the young crown prince, as well as his father, King Salman. 
The president brought several charts with him when he met with MbS at the White House that showed the type of weapons, vehicles, and equipment being bought by Saudi Arabia. The deals are worth tens of billions of dollars. 
Oprah Winfrey 
Nader Hashemi, the director of the Centre for Middle East Studies at the University of Denver's Josef Kor bel School of International Studies, told The Independent that MbS' meeting with Oprah may help create a better PR image for Saudi Arabia. 
"Saudi Arabia has always had a public image problem in the West because of the obvious things like women's rights and beheadings," Hashemi said. 
"When you meet with Oprah, even if you're not going to be interviewed, you're seeking the approval of an opinion maker. You're going into people's homes and reaching deep into American culture." 
Jim Mattis 
Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis was known for being a hawk toward Iran when he served as a general in the Marine Corps. Though he has argued in favor of keeping the Iran deal intact, he is still wary of Saudi Arabia's Middle East rival. 
MbS also serves as Saudi Arabia's Minister of Defense, and has made confronting Iran a top priority for Saudi Arabia. A meeting with his US counterpart is a no-brainer. 
Stephen Schwarzman 
Stephen Schwarzman is the chairman and CEO of The Blackstone Group, a global private equity firm. He is ranked 117th on Forbes' World's Billionaires List, and was the chairman of Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum before it was disbanded in August 2017. 
Blackstone unveiled a $40 billion infrastructure fund with Saudi Arabia in May 2017 that will "primarily invest in the United States." Saudi funding will account for half of the fund, at $20 billion. 
During this trip, Schwarzman organized an event in New York City where MbS met with 40 US executives. 
John Kerry 
John Kerry was the Secretary of State under former President Barack Obama. During his time at the State Department, he was involved with talks between the US and Saudi Arabia, mostly about countering Iran and the war against Yemen. 
The Crown Prince met with Kerry on Thursday, in a meeting described as "friendly." 
Henry Kissinger 
Henry Kissinger is one of America's longest-serving diplomats. 
The former secretary of state and national security advisor is known for his role in ending the Vietnam War and his pioneering of the d√©tente policy towards the Soviet Union, as well as helping open relation with the People's Republic of China. 
Antonio Guterres 
Antonio Guterres is the Secretary General of the United Nations. The UN has repeatedly accused the Kingdom of not doing enough to prevent civilian casualties in the Yemen, where Saudi Arabia is leading an air bombardment campaign against Yemenis who are seeking an independent state. The former president of Yemen was a staunch ally of Riyadh and a public revolution in the Arab country made him fly to Saudi Arabia where the kingdom started a heavy military campaign to change the course of events for itself. 
Michael Bloomberg 
Michael Bloomberg is the founder, owner, and CEO of Bloomberg LP, as well as the former mayor of New York. 
With a net worth of slightly over $50 billion, Bloomberg is the 7th richest person in the US, and 10th richest in the world. 
MbS, Bloomberg, and Joshua Steiner, the head of industry verticals at Bloomberg LP, were recently seen in a Starbucks in New York City.

Thomas Friedman is a three time Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who writes for the New York Times. He is the foreign affairs columnist for the Times, and often writes about the Middle East. 
Friedman wrote a glowing profile of MbS for the Times in November 2017, describing the Saudi crown prince as "a young leader who is driving religious and economic reform, who talks the language of high tech, and whose biggest sin may be that he wants to go too fast." 
MbS and Friedman are reportedly supposed to have dinner together at some point during his trip. 
Bill Gates 
Arguably the most well known businessman in the world, Bill Gates is the founder of Microsoft, one of the drivers of the personal computer revolution, and the second richest person in the world. 
Bill Gates met MbS in Riyadh in November 2017 to discuss "aspects of cooperation" and "joint bilateral development programs and projects."
