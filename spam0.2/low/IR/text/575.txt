In the meanwhile, he stressed that humanitarian and religious obligations are placed higher than political developments and added, “we (Iran) as in the before, in support for the people of Palestine will deliver on our responsibilities.” 
Highlighting the necessity of returning the glory and honor to Muslims he asserted, “the only way to returning honor and might to the Islamic Umma, is to resist against the imperialist powers and their powers.” 
He stressed that the issue of Palestine is atop of the agenda of the Islamic international political issues.

He called the nations and the youth of the Islamic countries and the Arab countries and also those governments which feel responsible towards the issue of Palestine to take their responsibility more seriously and force the enemies to retreat and loss. Tags
