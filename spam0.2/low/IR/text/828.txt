Time : Friday, April 13, 2018 News ID: 437196 Senior Cleric: US, Israel, Saudi Arabia Forming Sinister Triangle in Region Rasa - Tehran's provisional Friday Prayers Leader Ayatollah Mohammad Emami Kashani strongly blasted Washington, Riyadh and Tel Aviv for forming a notorious alliance against the Muslim countries of the region. RNA - Addressing a large and fervent congregation of the people in Tehran on Friday, Ayatollah Emami Kashani said, "The government of Saudi Arabia that was formed with the aim of spreading Wahabbism 80 years ago is now a side of a sinister triangle, along with the US and Israel to pursue the same goal." The senior Iranian cleric, meantime, condemned the recent Israeli attacks on the Palestinians, and said that the Tel Aviv regime will surely pay for its crimes. In relevant remarks earlier this week, Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi blasted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his anti-Iran remarks during his Paris visit, stressing that the Saudi rulers have put themselves beside the criminal Israeli regime in the region. "The incumbent rulers of Saudi Arabia who have put their name and country in the list of aggressors and criminals in the region to stand beside aggressive and criminal dictators like Saddam should know that by raising baseless allegations and hallucinations about Iran, they cannot ignore this reality that the regional countries and nations and all those who monitor international and regional developments and are aware of them will not forget Saudi Arabia's role in the creation, promotion and arming the violence-seeking and terrorist extremists who have committed numerous crimes in certain regional, neighboring and world states in different eras and under different titles, including the al-Qaeda, the ISIL and similar groups," Qassemi said. According to Fars News Agancy, he called on the Saudi rulers to take lesson from the fate of their past regional allies, including Saddam Hussein, who sought to buy security from the trans-regional states. Qassemi also expressed the hope that the French officials would remind their Saudi guests of the fate of the former aggressors and dictators in the region.
