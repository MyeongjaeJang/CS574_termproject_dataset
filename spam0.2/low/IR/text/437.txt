More than a dozen civilians have been killed and several others injured when Saudi military aircraft carried out separate airstrikes against residential areas across Yemen as the Riyadh regime continues with its atrocious bombardment campaign against its southern neighbor.
A local medical source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Arabic-language al-Masirah television network that Saudi warplanes targeted a refugee camp in the al-Hali district of Yemenâ€™s western coastal province of Hudaydah on Monday afternoon.
The source added that the aerial assault left 14 people dead and nine others injured.
The victims were all from the same family. There were seven children among the deceased.
Earlier in the day, Saudi fighter jets launched three airstrikes against an area in the city of Sirwah, which lies about 120 kilometers (75 miles) east of Sana'a.
There were, however, no immediate reports of casualties and the extent of damage caused.
