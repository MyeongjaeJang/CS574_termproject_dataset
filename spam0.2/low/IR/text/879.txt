Larijani leaves for Vietnam, Sri Lanka to discuss Syria News ID: 4271395 - Politics TEHRAN, Apr. 15 (MNA) – Iran’s Parl. Speaker Ali Larijani heading a delegation has left Tehran for Vietnamese capital Hanoi to discuss bilateral and international issues, particularly the Syrian situation after the recent US-led strikes. 
Heading a parliamentary delegation, Ali Larijani will also make a visit to Sri Lanka following his stop in Vientnam. 
Speaking to reporters before departure, Larijani said the aim of his visits is to expand bilateral relations in various fields, and to promote parliamentary cooperation with the two countries. 
He noted that the visit to Vietnam was supposed to take place a while ago, but was postponed due to tight schedules. 
“We will definitely discuss ways to boost economic relations. A part of such talks had already taken place during the visit of Chairperson of the National Assembly of Vietnam to Tehran [in April 2017],” he said. 
According to Vietnamese media, Larijani’s visit is made at the invitation of Vietnamese National Assembly (NA) Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan, and will last until April 18. 
Larijani added that the current global developments will also be discussed with the Vietnamese officials, noting the Sat. airstrikes carried out by the US, UK and France against Syria, which came after a suspected chemical weapons attack in Douma last weekend. 
“One of the key issues to be discussed with Vietnamese and Sri Lankan officials is the Syrian situation,” Larijani said. “Because, to our utter surprise, international mechanisms were all ignored in the attack, which can cause adverse consequences for future conflicts. Therefore, it is needed to talk with officials of Vietnam and Sri Lanka on this issue and hope that the talks would be helpful for establishing peace in the international scene.”
