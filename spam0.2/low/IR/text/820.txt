Zarif lambastes US for unethical behavior towards Iran News ID: 4270266 - Politics TEHRAN, Apr. 13 (MNA) – Iran’s foreign minister has sent a new post on his Twitter account lashing out at United States’ unethical behavior towards Iran nuclear deal. 
Mohammad Javad Zarif has just tweeted “US moral bankruptcy on full display in CIA chief’s admission of US policy.” 
The Iranian foreign minister goes on to condemn the US unethical behavior towards Iran’s nuclear deal saying “in the past, Iran was sanctioned over false claims that sought nuclear weapons. Now, sanctions must be reimposed because we seek no nukes.” 
The United States administration has repeatedly acted in violation of the nuclear deal with Iran since Donald Trump came to power last year. Trump announced earlier this year that he will refuse to waive sanctions against Iran in May if the Europeans countries cannot convince Iran to curb its missile program. 
Despite the US unlawful acts, the International Atomic Agency (the IAEA) has so far repeatedly confirmed Iran’s full compliance with the pact.
