Time : Friday, April 6, 2018 News ID: 437119 Iran: Saudi Arabia Pursuing Tragic Policies in Region Rasa - Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi blasted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman for his anti-Iran allegations, and said that the Riyadh government has resorted to a tragic diplomacy. RNA - "The recent policies adopted by Saudi Arabia are sadly tragic,"Qassemi said on Friday in reaction to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman's allegations in an interview with the London-based Times newspaper. "The ambitions of Saudi Crown Prince has no limitation and is turning out to be a chronic disease," the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman added. He reiterated that due to the war inside the House of Saud, bin Salman is making ridiculous and shameful remarks to gain the support of the US and Israel and is paying billions of dollars from people’s properties. "The neophyte prince has closed his eyes on the historic realities and the crimes of the child-killer and occupier Zionist regime for seven decades," Qassemi said, adding that bin Salman in a blatant treason against Palestinians’ aspirations has recognized the illegitimate regime of Israel. According to Fars News Agancy, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman said that the Saudi crown prince's remarks indicate the fact that he had not studied either history or geography and does not know even the aspiration of Saudi people and freedom seekers in the world. "Saudi Prince does not understand the oppression against Palestinians and does not differentiate friend and enemy," Qassemi said. Bin Salman has recently recognized the Zionist regime and has declared common interests for Saudi Arabia and Israel and described Iran as an enemy of Riyadh and Tel Aviv rulers.
