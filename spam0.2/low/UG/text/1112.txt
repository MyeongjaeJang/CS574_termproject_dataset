The minister for Karamoja affairs, Mr John Byabagambi has directed parents in Karamoja sub-region to stop sending their children to grazing fields and gold mines and instead send them to school. 
Mr Byabambi’s directive that was sent to all the districts of Karamoja sub-region last week follows the continuous poor school enrolment and performance in the region. 
He said despite government effort to construct schools in the region, parents have continued to keep their children away from the classrooms. 
“Children who are supposed to be at school are the ones grazing livestock in the bushes while others are engaged in gold mining. This must be stopped, “he said. 
Mr Byabagambi appealed to the district leaders at their various councils to pass bylaws that will require some penalties for parents who are still keeping children who have reached school-going age. 
“It’s only through education that we can cause changes and serious developments in Karamoja but short of that, it will be very difficult for the people of Karamoja to appreciate government projects, “he said. 
Mr Raymond Korobe, the district education officer Nakapiripirit said the high school dropout was posing a big threat to the development of Karamoja. 
He said Nakapiripirit District has about 40,000 schools going age children who are not at school.“They are grazing their livestock, mining gold and others are just loitering in the trading centres, “he said. 
According to Mr Korobe, the whole region has failed to come up with a strong policy that will make education compulsory. advertisement
