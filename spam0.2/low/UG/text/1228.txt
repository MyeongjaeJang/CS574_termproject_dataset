We will never forget Winnie Mandela Advertisement By Hussein Lumumba Amin 
Together, we mourn the untimely loss of an African mother and outstanding freedom fighter Winnie Mandela. Our condolences to her family, her gallant comrades, the free people of South Africa and all Africans. 
Winnie once famously said: “I am the product of the masses of my country, and the product of my enemy.” Indeed, her life’s journey has been one of challenges beyond what any ordinary woman could bare. But sadly, her enemy gave her no other choice, but to carry the burdens, share the enormous pain, and lift the unattainable hopes of an entire people in their unwavering, endless search for freedom, dignity, and justice. 
We remember her words of courage and suffering during the hard times when she said: “I no longer have the emotion of fear. There is no longer anything I can fear. There is nothing the government has not done to me. 
There isn’t any pain I haven’t known.”It is for this reason that all Africans she leaves behind, including those girls and women who are inspired by her inextinguishable march forward towards a brighter Africa, and the African men emboldened by her fierce struggle against the evils and cruelty of inhumane social injustice thrust upon her people, how can we forget all the resilient, tireless and determined mothers of our bright and rich continent?
