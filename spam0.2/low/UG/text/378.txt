Abba Mayanja’s silver medal in the 50m breaststroke event got the ball rolling for Team Uganda at the ongoing Cana Zone IV Championships in Lilongwe, Malawi.Mayanja is more popular as musician Jose Chameleon’s son but his ever improving trajectory in the swimming pool is a thing to note.He swam on Wednesday afternoon, a few hours after a lukewarm start to the championships by team captain Samora Lumonya in the 800m freestyle. Mayanja clocked a new 37.11 personal best (PB) in a fast 12 and under age group heat that was edged by Seychelles’ Nathan Nagapin (35.47) to win Uganda’s first medal at the championships.There were PBs across the board in the 50 breast from Shelby Clow (39.12), Paulsen Ssetumba (41.49) and Kevin Rugaaju (41.58) as the team continued to recover from the fatigue of travelling a day before the event and cope with Malawi heat.Mayanja’s act was followed by Dolphins teammate Kirabo Namutebi yesterday morning as she came second too in the 200m breast with a commendabe 2:55.83.Yesterday, presented a PBs galore in the 50m and 100m backstroke events with Nabil Saleh and Mercedes Mwebeiha missing out on medals by a few microseconds.Even Lumonya who had complained of a shoulder problem after his first event showed signs of recovery as he managed a PB in the 50m back (34.01). “We took him to the doctor for a massage and he is getting better. The performances from everyone will also get better,” coach Tonnie Kasujja, said. advertisement
