Kampala. 
Gulu host Kumi University today in the Pepsi University Football League looking to bounce back from last week’s 4-0 defeat to Uganda Christian University at Mukono.Although Gulu are poor travelers, the defeat was Gulu’s worst ever in the competition which team manager Jude Oryema attributed to first game jitters and inexperience.“That was our first game of the season and we were playing away with a number of new players and I don’t blame the team. No one wants to lose but sometimes you have such games. Against Kumi I am sure we will do much better especially since we are at home,” Oryema said.Oryema said that despite the defeat the team was in high spirits ahead of their game.“We resumed training on Monday and everyone is in very good spirits. The season has just started and I know we will recover and finish at the top of our group,” Oryema added.Kumi University find themselves in a similar situation having suffered a 5-2 defeat to Bugema University with coach Stephen Onyait also putting it down to immaturity. advertisement
