Nowadays, to tighten the vagina, one is advised to pass urine while relaxing and tightening the muscles that control urine. Recently, you advised against it. Why? Mukoza 
Dear Mukoza,Whereas perineal tightness could be every womanâ€™s dream because this makes her and her sexual partner enjoy sex more, it should not be done at the expense of her general health. 
Holding urine when the bladder is full or by interrupting the passage of urine, much as the latter can help tighten the perineal muscles, will cause a woman to get urinary tract infections. 
Please visit your gynaecologist to discuss other ways of keeping perineal tightness instead of the type that may keep you perpetually sick with urinary tract infections. advertisement
