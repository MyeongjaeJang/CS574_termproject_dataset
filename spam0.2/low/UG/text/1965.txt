Mugabe and his family actually lived in the "Blue Roof " mansion, a lavish private house in the suburbs during the later years of his presidency."We don't want to create the impression that we are chasing him away," Charamba said, adding that Mugabe, 94, was currently in Singapore for one of his regular health checks.
