KAMPALA. 
The Luzira Prisons Grounds was full to capacity yesterday as Maroons played out a goalless draw with reigning Azam Uganda Premier League (AUPL) champions KCCA.With no other league game played, there were a number of rival fans present and hoping that the hosts would do them a favour in a title race that also includes leaders SC Villa and Vipers.As a result they must have been the most relieved party as Maroons goalkeeper Ashadu Bugembe pulled off a double save in the final moments of added time to ensure a share of the spoils. The result moved KCCA a point clear in second position ahead of Vipers who have 43 points.The tally for the Lugogo-based side is however still five points behind leaders Villa, who have 49 points from 23 games and have played a game more.“We still have eight games so we need to see how to negotiate those ones. Villa have the advantage now but that doesn’t stop us from fighting up to the end but like I said the championship will go down to the wire,” Mutebi opined after the game.Despite the late pressure that yielded the double save from Allan Okello and substitute Muhammad Shaban, they were lucky to stay level after William Kiibi and Solomon Walusimbi fluffed earlier chances. Maroons lie sixth with 33 points in a season they have avoided defeat against three title contenders.
