THIS WEEK: Museveni speaks out Rwanda, Uganda tension reports 
Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | President Yoweri Museveni met his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame at State House in Entebbe on the afternoon of Mar.25 amidst reports of tension between the two countries. 
He together with his host Mr Museveni first held a closed-door meeting with their delegations that included ministers and senior security officials. 
Kagame who was accompanied by his Foreign Affairs Minister Louise Muishiwabo and the head of Rwandan intelligence Maj Gen Nzabamwita held a closed door meeting with Museveni before both addressed a press conference where they rubbished the alleged controversy between them. 
“There is no fundamental problem between Uganda and Rwanda. We don’t even have a border problem like with Kenya on issues related to Migingo Island, with Rwanda there is nothing really.” Museveni spoke of the meeting being about security and other development issues affecting the two countries. 
However although the two leaders dismissed any problems between them, suspicions were raised when Museveni last week cancelled a trip to Kigali yet in February Kagame too didn’t show up in Kampala for the East African Heads of State Summit on health and infrastructure development. Apart from this, several reports have showed that the tension between the two could have caused the recent reshuffle in the police force as bigwigs were named in for instance in a case involving kidnap of a Rwandan national.
