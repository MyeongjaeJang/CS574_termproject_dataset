How can a teacher’s competence be determined? Advertisement By Stephen Siima 
The word “competence” is increasingly being used in education circles today. It is a description of one’s ability, a measure of one’s performance. 
The issue is in the news, especially in Nakaseke District, where primary teachers will be made to re-sit PLE papers apparently to determine their competencies. Competence can be measured in terms of either outcome or output. 
Outcome indicators of teacher competence include increased test scores or a harmonious classroom where pupils seem happy active and well behaved. Competence evaluation that relies on PLE papers is less likely to result in “false positives” - that is labelling a competent teacher as incompetent. 
The initial challenge for teachers is to acquire the basic classroom skills needed to teach their lessons. Teaching from this perspective is an act of good performance. 
For a teacher to be able to carry themselves through the lesson, they need to have a series of techniques and routines at their fingertips. What we mean by the term teacher training refers to instruction in basic classroom skills. 
Training involves the development of a repertoire of teaching skills, acquired through observing experienced teachers and often through practice teaching in a controlled setting. Good training is viewed as a mastery of a set of skills or competencies. 
Every competent teacher should possess a strong set of values, skills and knowledge. Teachers should develop holistic teaching skills and thinking through induction and mentoring even within the school. Stephen Siima,
