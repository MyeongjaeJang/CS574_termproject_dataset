ADJUMANI -The Police leadership in Adjumani District are in confusion after a suspect died in a holding cell at Adjumani Central Police Station, at the weekend. 
Franco Igama, 40, a resident of Aliwara village, Mungula Parish in Adjumani District was reportedly tortured after being arrested by a group of people over land wrangles. 
Mr Denis Unzimai, the brother-in-law of the deceased told Daily Monitor that he became suspicious after being blocked from accessing the suspect. 
“A police officer at the counter told me to handover the food to him. It seems the police were concealing information about the fate of the suspect,” he said. 
Mr Benson Anyanzo, the brother of Igama said he was tortured by the people who arrested him in the presence of one police officer. Mr Anyanzo said he alerted the officer in charge of Mungula Police Post who reportedly said the arresting party was acting on “orders from above.” 
“My brother died in the police cell and the body was later taken to Adjumani Hospital Mortuary,” Mr Anyanzo said. However, the Adjumani District Police Commander, Mr Simon Symsingira said the suspect was rushed to hospital where he died minutes later. 
He described the incident as unfortunate.
