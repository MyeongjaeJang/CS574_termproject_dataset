Former Forum for Democratice Change (FDC) president Gen Mugisha Muntu has urged religious leaders to remain firm and criticise the National Resistance Movement (NRM) government over its wrong deeds. Gen Muntu said this during his consultative meeting with leaders in Bugisu sub region that was held on Friday at Kayegi hotel in Mbale town. He said that government is simply acting naïve and scared of the influence and the power that religious leaders hold. “The religious leaders should remain confident and strong as they continue critiquing the government where it’s going wrong. I appeal to them to not fear because the God is there to protect them,” he said. Gen Muntu said religious leaders should ensure that their flock is not misled by government, adding that the NRM regime is nearing its end now that it has started confronting the church. Muntu wondered why the government would support religious leaders who are lenient to regime while subjecting to oppression those who simply speak out about the ill deeds by government. Gen Muntu’s remarks come shortly after Kampala Archishop Cyprian Kizito Lwanga alleged that the state had infiltrated the church and that it had started recruiting priests to spy on bishops. The former FDC president said government has been blinded by its cumulative mistakes over the years. “The regime thinks that they will attack the church and people will simply look on like other issues, however; this is now the triggering factor and the revolution is about to start if the leadership in power does not come out to act upon the grievances of the people in the country,” he said. advertisement
