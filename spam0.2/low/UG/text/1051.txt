Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Constantin Reliu, 63, had the shock of his life when he was told that he was, in actual fact, dead. 
Apparently, his estranged wife had registered his death in 2016 after he didn’t return to Romania from Turkey, where he had worked as a chef for more than 20 years. 
He has since been living a legalistic nightmare of trying to prove to authorities that he is alive. 
The court has refused to overturn his death certificate. “I am a living ghost,” Reliu said, “I am officially dead, although I’m alive.” Share on:
