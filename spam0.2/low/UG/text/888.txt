Rugby Sevens Cranes coach Tolbert Onyango watched his side blow hot and cold in Zimabwbe at the Victoria Falls Sevens over last weekend. While Onyango picked positives from the two-day tournament at Victoria Falls Primary School, he has not shied away from the fact that the side also needs to improve. “It was a very competitive tournament with lots of positives and also room for improvement,” he told Daily Monitor. The side has now trained since Wednesday and will have the last session on Saturday before leaving for Hong Kong on Easter. Onyango who named his side on Wednesday has had only this week to correct what he did not like while in Zimbabwe before tackling the HSBC World Series Qualifiers and Commonwealth Games.“From my end we have discovered what works and what doesn’t in terms of play, so we keep working on the positives and push to get better on the areas where we fell short.” Uganda managed a quarter final finish at their last outing in Hong Kong last year. Tries from Ramathan Govule and Solomon Okia were not enough as Papa New Guinea overcame the Cranes 10-14. With a prep tournament under their belt this time around, the Cranes will hope for a better outing in the series qualifiers with core status the reward. Uganda are in pool E with Georgia, Japan and Chile for their most significant tourney of a busy year before they head to Australia. advertisement
