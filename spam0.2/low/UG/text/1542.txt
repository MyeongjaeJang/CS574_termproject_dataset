Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | MTN Uganda plans to use the next 10 years to focus on expanding its data network and mobile money services, according to its CEO, Wim Vanhelleputte. 
Vanhelleputte, who spoke shortly after a public hearing on renewal of its operating license at the Uganda Communications Commission headquarters on March 29, said the company currently covers only 50% of the population and expects to go up to 99%. 
“The next item to focus on is to take our mobile money services to the next level; this will promote a digital economy through a cashless society,” he said. 
He said the company wants to be a key partner with the government in development of the new economy that will drive on mobile money and financial inclusion. 
MTN, which has been in operation in the country for nearly two decades, has 11.2 million subscribers, more than half of the country’s mobile subscribers. Share on:
