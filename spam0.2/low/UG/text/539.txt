Two people died on spot and several others sustained serious injuries when a taxi registration number UAY 815L overturned several times along Ibanda-Mbarara road. 
The accident happened at ten miles from Mbarara town after Nyakisharara airstrip. 
Rwizi region traffic officer, Mr Justine Opus, confirmed the accident saying the taxi which was heading to Mbarara from Ibanda overturned several times killing two on spot after a tyre burst. 
‘’At around 5:15pm, a taxi travelling from Ibanda to Mbarara overturned several times killing two instantly and leaving many others injured,’’ Mr Opus said. 
The accident was allegedly caused by front tyre bursting which led the driver to lose control of the vehicle thus overturning several times. 
Mr Opus said all the victims (dead and injured) were taken to Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (for postmortem and treatment respectively). 
Mr Julius Ahimbisibwe, an eye witness, said the taxi was at a terrific speed before its front tyre burst causing it to overturn several times. 
‘’I was here in the farm and saw a vehicle coming from Ibanda at a very high speed and when it reached at this point, one of its front tyres burst and the driver failed to control it before the vehicle overturned three times’’ an eye witness said. advertisement
