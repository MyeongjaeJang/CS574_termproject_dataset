December 2014, a distressed 16-year-old girl living in Nyendo town in Masaka district got fed up with her father constantly defiling her, and decided enough was enough. One night, she got a machete (panga) and hacked him in the head – a strike that killed him – when he had entered her room for routine sex. 
Later, she told Police that she had begged her ruthless father for years to stop defiling her but that he had refused to hear any of that. Unfortunately, their mother knew this was happening, but she had feared to report to the police. She also knew her husband had fathered children with two of his eldest daughters. But it would be only a matter of time until the truth would come to light. And it sure did when the girl felt she had taken enough of the misery and went on to slay her father. - Advertisement -
