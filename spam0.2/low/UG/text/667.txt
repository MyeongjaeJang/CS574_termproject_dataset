What will you do? Quitting is never an option you just need to pull up your socks,” Mr Omojong stressed.He also tipped the students to attain financial literacy by learning how spend less than they are given by their parents.Students embraced the expo listening to renowned personalities with diverse expertise who are always invited to mentor them so at smoothly transit from the school life, university life and usher them into the job market either as employees or entrepreneurs.“While at the university you keep on fantasizing what life out there could be, but when you are directed by people who are already experiencing, it you get firm,” Daniel Makumbi, a student, said after the expo.In 2017, NSSF and Monitor Publication Ltd merged their annual university career fairs with an intention of producing more impressive fairs covering eleven universities across the country. advertisement
