Former Parliament speaker Edward Kiwanuka Ssekandi has been dumped as Vice President and consequently replaced by the once powerful former Prime Minister John Patrick Amama Mbabazi. 
President Museveni who is currently at his farm in Kisozi, made the quick changes on Saturday. In a statement from the presidency, Museveni said that Mbabazi’s experience in leadership cannot be under looked despite him forgetting the NRM Ideology when he chose to quit for power. 
“I therefore appoint Mr Mbabazi Vice President of the Republic of Uganda with immediate effect. He will replace Hon Edward Kiwanuka Ssekandi whose next posting will be communicated in due course,” Museveni said. 
According to a source close to the President, Ssekandi is being prepared for an ambassadorial position. 
However, Nile Post didn’t contact Mr Mbabazi over the appointment because this story is just what it is- FALSE. Post Views: 1,719
