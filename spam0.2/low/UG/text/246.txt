Kampala. The Judiciary has recovered Shs630,000 from High Court judge Elizabeth Kabanda Kibula as directed by the Inspector General of Government (IGG). This follows a complaint by her former driver and bodyguard that she signed for their allowances but did not remit it to them.The judge refunded the said money following an investigation and subsequent report orders by the deputy IGG, Ms Mariam Wangadya, over a fortnight ago. 
“Justice Elizabeth Kabanda Kibula on March 14, 2018, refunded Shs630,000,” reads in part the progressive report from the Judiciary to the IGG dated March 15, 2018.Out of the Shs630,000, Shs290,000 is meant for her former bodyguard, Mr Jimmy Eyou and her former driver, Mr Matiya Akantorana. Also, Shs340,000 refund is the money that was irregularly paid to Justice Kabanda for two extra nights while at Mubende High Court criminal session in 2017. 
“The Mubende High Court criminal session lasted 40 days but Justice Kabanda was facilitated for 42 days,” the IGG’s recent report further states, adding: “Justice Kabanda should refund Shs340,000 for the extra two nights that was irregularly paid to her while at Mubende High Court.”In the same progressive report to the IGG, the Judiciary also confirmed having paid Shs1.2m to Justice Kabanda’s former driver, Mr Akantorana, to compensate for his night allowance that he didn’t get, covering the period between January 31 to March 15, 2017.The progressive report also indicates that the Judiciary, effective March 1, stopped the practice of depositing allowances of bodyguards and drivers on the bank accounts of judges to avoid similar occurrences in the future. 
Further in the progressive report to the IGG, the Accountant General has been directed to cause the recovery of Shs3m from the then Mpigi court cashier, Mr Geoffrey Jaggwe, for forgery of accountabilities during the criminal session presided over by Ms Kabanda.
