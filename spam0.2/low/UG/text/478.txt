Egyptian government ‘launch Facebook rival’-EgFace March 23, 2018 - Advertisement - 
A new Egyptian social media platform similar to Facebook appears to have been launched in Egypt. And the name is EgFace . Lebanese news site An-Nahar says the site appears to have been built in a hurry less than two weeks after Egypt’s communications minister announced that Egypt would launch its own social network. 
Egyptians online ridiculed the idea announced in 12 March, with many suggesting that it was an attempt by security authorities to gather information about users and monitor their accounts. - Advertisement - 
Many Facebook accounts have been recently closed and several online users arrested for “inciting against the state, army and police”. Source:BBC
