Sunday April 15 2018 Dislocated jaw affected me, says bronze medallist Miiro Miiro showed that he has a stomach for a big fight when he soldiered on in his quarterfinal despite a dislocated jaw against Amit PHOTO BY MARK NAMANYA Advertisement By Mark Namanya 
Uganda’s Juma Miiro had to settle for Commonwealth bronze in the men’s 46-49kg category after a comprehensive defeat to India’s Panghal Amit at Oxenford Studios in Gold Coast on Friday.The brave little warrior attributed his heavy defeat to a dislocated jaw from a thunderous Amit punch in the early stages of the opening round. The origin of the dislocation, said Miiro, was a beating he suffered in Entebbe at the hands of a rival gang of boxers two years ago. 
Hard puncher “I nearly gave up,” Miiro explained post-fight. “He is a very hard puncher; he hits harder than Shaffi and that is why I was moving away and running from his powerful shots.”Twice in the fight he was given a standing count as the blows came in thick and heavy but Miiro soldiered on.“His first blow caught my jaw and dislocated it. From then on I was playing catch up. I did not want to give in because I am desperate to turn professional.“I was injured but I fought on because I didn’t want to suffer an early stoppage. I do not want to dent my professional dream.” 
Jaw assessment Miiro, who was due to visit the Games Village polyclinic for an assessment of his jaw, was bitterly disappointed that his dream had ended the way it did.“I could have done better but that dislocation changed things.” He is now eyeing a professional career in a move that will help him steer away from boxing’s administrative woes.“I have to think for my best interests at this point in my career and I will weigh the options but a (professional) move is overdue for me.” Miiro is an elder brother to Fazil Juma, who also won a bronze medal for Uganda at the 2014 Games in Glasgow. advertisement
