Hi Paul, I recently got a puncture and since I did not know how to change a tyre, I enlisted the help of a boda boda cyclist. In the process, the car fell off the jack and almost hurt him. What is the safest way to change a tyre? John Kunihira. 
Hello John, changing a car tyre can be a daunting first time experience. However, it is easy if you follow the manufacturer recommended and general guidelines. The best way is to prepare ahead by knowing what the tyre changing tools look like and where the tools and spare tyre are stored. The standard wheel changing tools kit consists of a jack, jack handle and wheel spanner. 
Familiarise yourself with the tools and how to assemble them. Test and lubricate them and know the safety precautions. Select a safe spot off the road on a firm flat surface and if you are parked by the roadside, provide ample warning for oncoming traffic using emergency reflectors. If you do not have them, open your trunk lid or boot and switch on hazard lights. Brace or choke the wheels with suitable wheel braces, firm pieces of timber or improvised stones to prevent movement as you jack up the car. 
Loosen the studs or nuts on your wheel with the wheel spanner and use the correct point to fit the jack and lift the car a quarter to half a foot off the ground. Take off the wheel nuts or studs. Replace the deflated tyre with the spare tyre making sure that you seat it properly on all five studs. Fit all nuts and turn them with your hand to follow through the threads until they are firm enough to tighten with the wheel spanner. Lower the jack and remove it. Tighten the nuts or studs to ensure that they will not loosen as you drive. Remove the wheel chokes and you are good to go. advertisement
