Gold Coast, Australia | THE INDEPENDENT | Stella Chesang joined the list of Ugandan Commonwealth Games champions by winning the 10,000m final emphatically at the Gold Coast event on Monday. 
She becomes only the second ever Uganda champion in the women’s events after Dorcus Inzikuru, winner of the steeplechase in Melbourne in 2006. 
Chesang, 21, a former world mountain running champion, beat off a still challenge from Kenyan Stacy Ndiwa who settled for second position. She took the race in 31:45.30, with the Kenyan challenger coming in at 31:46.36 in a personal best. 
Ugandan youngster Mercyline Chelangat,20, capped a fine performance by Uganda by grabbing the bronze medal. 
Just a day earlier, Joshua Cheptegei set the pace for the Ugandans on day one of athletics by winning the men’s 5000m final. 
“I want to congratulate Stella Chesang for winning Gold in the Women’s 10,000m finals at the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia. You have done your country proud!,” Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said in a tweet soon after.
