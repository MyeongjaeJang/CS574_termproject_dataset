Police indicate that those on board included Government Chief Whip Ruth Nankabirwa and State Minister for Planning, David Bahati. Also on board was Rukiga District Woman Member of Parliament, Caroline Kamusiime Muhwezi. The incident occurred at about 6:30 pm at Kabale Golf Course on Makanga Hill, Kabale Municipality. The officials had chartered the helicopter registration number 5X-KEG, white in colour, to fly to Rukiga district to attend a belated International Women's Day event at St, Barnabas Secondary School Karujanga in Katuna Town council, Ndorwa West County, Kabale District. Nankabirwa was the Guest of Honour at the function. After the function, the officials prepared to take off back to Kampala. Alex Rukundo, an eyewitness says that the helicopter flew about 300 meters off the ground and suddenly lost balance. Rukundo says that it started to suddenly lose height as it quickly descended back on the ground. In the process, it destroyed electricity wires. He says that the pilot struggled with the helicopter until it made an emergency landing. Immediately, all the occupants on board jumped out unhurt. The helicopter belongs to Kampala Executive Aviation and was being piloted by two South African pilots - Chris Dewit assisted by Rowen Mcharry. Nankabirwa and Kamusiime declined to talk to journalists. They cancelled the journey and went to White Horse Inn Hotel where they spent a night. The Kigezi Region Police Commander, Ashraf Seiko Chemonges, says that he will comment on the matter later. advertisement
