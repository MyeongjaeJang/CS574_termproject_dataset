A first year student of Makerere University has drowned in the swimming pool at the university this morning. ASP Denis Kasibante, the Officer in-Charge Makerere University Police Station has confirmed that John Paul Mirimu, a student of Information Systems and resident of Nsibirwa Hall, died on arrival at Mulago Hospital. Kasibante told this reporter that Mirimu together with his colleagues jumped over the fence to the University swimming pool around 5:00am after jogging, which is part of the Nsibirwa hall culture. It is said that a group jumped into the swimming pool and started swimming until 6:30am when his colleagues realised he was missing after going to the deep end of the pool. Police say the student died immediately after they reached Mulago Hospital's emergency unit where he had been rushed for help. "By the time they called us to bring our 999 patrol car, the boy was struggling to breath. We rushed him to the University hospital but we were referred to Mulago and the boy died at exactly 6:40am as soon as we had reached Mulago Hospital," Kasibante said in a phone interview. Martins Kato, the Guild Information Minister at Makerere University said when they reached the University Hospital there was no one to attend to them. According to Kato, it was Milimu's first time to use the swimming pool. advertisement
