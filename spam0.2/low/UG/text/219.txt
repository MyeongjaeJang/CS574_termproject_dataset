The Director General of Internal Security Organisation (ISO) Col Kaka Bagyenda has implored African states to share information and strengthen bilateral relationships in a bid to contain terrorism. 
Addressing heads of intelligence and security services from 12 African states about armed groups and negative forces, Col Kaka said national intelligence services can use internet and modern technology such as satellite phones to share information and knowledge on weapons to track down the emerging terrorist groups. 
“Modern technology can be used to enrich the power of old age procedures against terrorist groups on the continent, It is empirical for Nations, Regions and Continents to work together in a bid to contend and control all emerging security threats for safety and peace in the region,” Col Kaka said at the Pearl of Africa Hotel in Kampala. 
He lauded the Committee of Intelligence and Security Services of Africa (CISSA) for its continued support in ensuring peace on the African continent. 
Col. Kaka’s remarks come at a time when African countries face the paradox of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC); the Al-Shabaab in Somalia and Kenya and, the Boko Haram in Nigeria that have killed innocent people under the guise of establishing Islamic caliphates. 
Meanwhile, Uganda’s Deputy Chief of Defense Forces Lt. Gen. Wilson Mbadi has implored African nations to share intelligence to effectively deal with armed terrorist groups on the continent.
