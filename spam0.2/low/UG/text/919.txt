How can I be successful at work? HR Specialist & Journalist at Monitor Publications Limited, Isaiah Kitimbo Advertisement By Isaiah Kitimbo 
I am passionate about my work, but I am not growing. However hard I work, I always miss out on opportunities to grow. My boss seems not to notice the contribution I make to the company. I am tired of being stagnant, it is frustrating me. What can I do? Peter 
Dear Peter, You do not necessarily have to be a chef to tell the taste of a meal nor must you be a managing director to determine a company’s direction. It’s all about taking keen interest in developments around you and how they impact your operations. This helps you to identify areas where you are doing well and those where you need to put in a little more effort. The various skills and abilities possessed by different employees form a critical mass for driving company productivity. In return, the workers expect a reward for their contribution to the organisation. Therefore, it is very important that, as an individual employee, you understand that your contribution is crucial even with or without rewards. It can make or break an organisation. Beware and resist those who take you as an excuse for their incompetence. You are a key driver to both your future personal success and that of your organisation. By learning to stand out as a valuable asset, you are on your way for the heights. Begin to see opportunities where others see challenges and learn faster. Become more accountable in whatever you do at work, build trust among those around you and network. Also, make the right decisions, develop effective communication channels, plan better, define goals and strategy.
