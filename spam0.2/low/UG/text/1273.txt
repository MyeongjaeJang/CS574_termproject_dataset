A total of 587 police officers have today sat for the African Union (AU) Pre -Assessment for Assistance Mission Service (AMS) examinations at Nsambya Youth Sharing Hall. Assistant Insperctor General of Police (AIGP) Grace Turyagumanawe, the Director Peace Support Operations Uganda Police Force, said the Kampala exams are to prepare the police officers for the next examination where they will compete with others at continental level. 
AIGP Turyagumanawe said that the exams are prepared by African Union and will be used to select those who qualify to be deployed in any Mission in Africa where there’s no peace. 
“Those that qualify for the interview must be attested members of the police force, not be on probation served at least for five years and with no any acts of indiscipline in their files, a valid driving permit and a passport,” AIGP Turyagumanawe said. 
He highlighted benefits of Uganda police officers going for peace missions abroad as being exposure to international policing experience, promoting transparency and improving their welfare.
