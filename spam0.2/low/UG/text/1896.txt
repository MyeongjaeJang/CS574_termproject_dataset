The Deputy Attorney General Mwesigwa Rukutana together with the Solicitor General Francis Atoke have this morning led a team of 18 State Attorneys to defend the age limit law before the Constitutional Court sitting at Mbale High Court. 
In his opening remarks, Rukutana maintained that Parliament acted within the law and prescribed procedures to duly amend the Constitution. 
In his submissions, Rukutana has also applauded the speaker of Parliament, Rebecca Kadaga for having acted within the law during the entire process of conceptualisation and actualisation of the bill on top of supporting President Museveni for having legally assented it to the law. 
He has further defended government as having acted legally in doing whatever it took to facilitate the entire process of this Constitutional amendment. 
Rukutana has therefore asked court to dismiss each of the five petitions with costs on grounds that they lack merit and that none of the petitioners has demonstrated how he/she has suffered any damages as a result of amending article (102) b. 
In a related development, court has summoned the Mukono Municipality MP, Betty Nambooze Bakireke to appear on Tuesday next week for cross-examination by the Attorney General on her affidavit regarding the claims she made about being assaulted by security personnel during the debate on the Age Limit bill in Parliament. 
While applying for summons against Nambooze, the director of civil litigation Christine Kahwa stated that Nambooze should come with her medical record spanning the last eight years. advertisement
