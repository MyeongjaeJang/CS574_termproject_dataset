Charles Aleku, a Prison warder attached to Amuru Prison in Amuru District is in trouble for allegedly stealing a gun. Aleku was arrested by police from Otwee Prison on Tuesday 10 after reporting the loss of his gun. Quoting sources, Mr Patrick Jimmy Okema, the Aswa River Region Police spokesperson, said Aleku allegedly surrendered his gun to an unknown thugs who sneaked into Otwee Prison where he had been deployed. He says Aleku's statement is questionable because he reported the gun loss to police at mid night, about two hours after the incident. Mr Okema said police have preferred charges of gun theft against the warder. Mr Bilak Jalmoro, the Amuru Resident District Commissioner accuses the warder of conniving with criminals.
