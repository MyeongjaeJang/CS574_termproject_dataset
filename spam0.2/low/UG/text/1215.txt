Commonwealth Youth champion Lalam dreams of senior gold at Gold Coast meet Commonwealth Youth gold medallist Joyce Lalam. COURTESY PHOTO In Summary When asked exactly how long she can throw, she estimated 55 metres. Now that would be a giant leap from even her golden throw in Bahamas, but it’s a whole 7.95 metres less than the 62.95 metres that won Australia’s Kelsey-Lee Roberts bronze at Glasgow 2014.   Commonwealth Youth gold medallist Joyce Lalam feels she can also win gold at the senior event in Gold Coast, Australia. 
Lalam, a student at Gombe SS, won gold in javelin at the 2017 Commonwealth Youth Games in Bahamas last year. It was a rare feat by Ugandan standards.This time, despite being Uganda’s only participant in field events, she is adamantly, innocently hopeful. 
Going by her latest performance, any medal in Gold Coast is improbable. At the national trials Lalam only managed 51 metres, a decline from the 51.89 metres she threw to win gold in Bahamas. It is also her personal best. 
But she is daring: “I can win gold, again,” she said wearing her usual free smile, just seconds before the team set off from Lugogo yesterday.“You see we haven’t had enough time to prepare but I think I can make it because the javelins we use here are very heavy but the ones in the competitions are light, so I can really improve on my record.” 
At the 2017 East Africa Secondary School Games, Lalam was beaten by schoolmate Victoria Awidi. But she calls that ‘a mistake’.When asked exactly how long she can throw, she estimated 55 metres. Now that would be a giant leap from even her golden throw in Bahamas, but it’s a whole 7.95 metres less than the 62.95 metres that won Australia’s Kelsey-Lee Roberts bronze at Glasgow 2014.
