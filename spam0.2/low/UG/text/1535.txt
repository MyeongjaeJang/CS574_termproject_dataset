This begs the question; Hon. Kadaga are you with Ugandans or with Umeme? 
Flask back 
Below we bring you a summary of the Gen Saleh report effort to reduce Electricity tariffs in Uganda 
The UMEME distribution license was issued on 1st March 2005 by the electricity regulation authority based on an earlier signed concession agreement that specifically amongst others stated 
UMEME would invest in the distribution grid owned by Uganda electricity distribution company UEDCL That UMEME would take over the already financed ADB and IDA loan financed worth 11 million dollars and 36 billion shillings whose disbursement in terms of transformers and substations and feeders had by 2005 brought down the technical and commercial losses to 28% from 36% as highlighted by the auditor general audited accounts for the year 2005 of UEDCL signed off by Auditor general John Muwanga. That UMEME would pay taxes to URA 
That UMEME EFFICIENCY in further reducing the losses would be its revenue source. That UMEME WOULD BE SUBJECT TO REGULATION by the electricity regulatory authority (ERA) under the electricity act of which the core principle was that all electricity tariff setting was the preserve of ERA subject to UMEME defending any such tariff change requests The above primary core points in the original concession agreement were aimed at ensuring the proper supervision of the concessionaire and made it a viable contract at the time. 
However in November of 2006 six individuals met, negotiated and signed off the first 0f 4 Amendments to the original concession agreement that all but removed all the above obligations UMEME initially had The 2006 Amendment undertook the following; It identified what they termed as “regulatory risk” to UMEME and removed many of the powers the regulator had of supervising UMEME It included compensation for technical and financial losses to UMEME within the tariff and later subsidies from the consolidated fund thereby raising the tariff and giving leeway to UMEME to disregard the need to be efficient in order to earn profits and accorded them a revenue base in terms of compensating them for whatever loss they declared. 
It allowed UMEME to collect taxes paid to URA in any previous financial accounting year, from electricity consumers in the subsequent financial year a method of tariff setting not in consonance with the electricity act proscribed method of tariff setting. 
The amendment also allowed UMEME leeway in loss declarations by giving them a loss threshold of up to 38% for which they could be compensated , up from the 28% loss level at the beginning of the concession that had been audited as a result of the ADB and IDA financed loss reduction program started in 2001 and referred to above increasing the energy sector financial requirements also known as the tariff by USD$ 40 MILLION DOLLARS annually given that each 1 percentage loss is equal to USD$4 MILLION DOLLARS annually. 
However, as political pressure on the sector increased due to the increasing tariff compensations to UMEME a new relief was introduced in the form of Tariff Relief Rebates, an accounting procedure on the invoice of UETCL to UMEME in which loss compensations plus any other tariff adjustment requirements were deducted at source from UMEME payments to UETCL for electricity bought from the later by the former. These tariff relief rebates spiraled from 2007
