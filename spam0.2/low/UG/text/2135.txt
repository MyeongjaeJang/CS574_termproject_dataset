SIM Card replacement made easy, as UCC, Telecoms receives Data Readers   
The National Identification and Registration Authority (NIRA) has handed over 50 biometric card readers to Uganda Communication Commission (UCC) to aid in the process of simcard replacements and swaps. These machines will be handed over to Telecommunication companies early next week to aid them through the process of replacing and registering new simcards.The NIRA executive director Judy Obitre-gama says the Identity card readers will be distributed to different telecom companies in a bid to expedite the sim card replacement process as the telecom companies import and install their own card readers at different centres around the country 
With new card readers, those whom intend to replace or register their SimCards will no longer be required to go to NIRA offices for verification. They will only need a police letter and their national ID to do so. - Advertisement - 
“We are aware of frustrations Ugandans have been going through to replace their stolen simcards. Now that we have the machines, we hope by Monday, the situation will go back to normal,” said UCC Director for corporate affairs, Fred Otunnu, 
The application program interface, which will integrate systems from telecoms through UCC into NIRA database, will enable real time verification to empower the licensees with simcard authenticity. Earlier last month, UCC banned issuance and replacements of new SIM cards awaiting the installation of the Application Programming Interface (API) with the NIRA. - Advertisement -
