NAMUTUMBA- A hunt for a 33-year-old man believed to have been kidnapped for a Shs1m ransom, in Namutumba District has entered day four. 
Simon Mulondo, a resident of Bugobi Village, Bulange Sub-county in Namutumba District, was reportedly kidnapped on Monday evening by unknown people who were travelling on a motorcycle. 
According to his brother, Mr Abbey Ssendagire, the kidnappers found Mulondo walking on Bulange Road and kidnapped him. They reportedly covered his head with a piece of cloth before escaping. 
The abductors reportedly used the ebductee’s mobile phone to call one of his brothers; Mr Charles Ssendagire, and demanded a Shs1m ransom before they could release him. 
Mr Ssendagire reportedly told the kidnappers that they didn’t have the money and reported the matter to Bugobi Police Post. 
“As family members, we are worried because we don’t know the motive of these abductors,” Mr Ssendagire said. 
A police officer who requested for anonymity to speak freely said the abductors have called him five times threatening to harm Mulondo if the ransom money is not sent to them. 
“They rang on Tuesday and threatened to harm the victim if his brother delays to send the money. However, since then, the hijackers have since switched Mulondo’s phone off,” he said. 
Busoga East Region police spokesman, Mr James Mubi, confirmed the incident, saying the motive and identity of the kidnappers were still unknown. 
He said: “Their identity and motive is still unknown but we are working with other security agencies to trace the perpetrators and free the victim.” advertisement
