Court convicts man for selling cancer drugs Advertisement By BETTY NDAGIRE 
Kampala- Buganda Road Chief Magistrates’ Court yesterday convicted a man over possession and vending restricted cancer drugs to Mulago National Referral Hospital and cancer patients. 
Mr Job Fred Niyonzima in July 2017, denied three counts of unlawful possession of classified cancer drugs, selling restricted classified drugs and importing a drug without licence. 
This prompted the State to present four witnesses to prove the ingredients of the offences as charged. 
Classified drugs While delivering the judgment on the count of possession of drugs, the chief magistrate, Mr James Ereemye, said three prosecution witnesses testified that Niyonzima was found with Avastin and Sutent drugs which are classified under the National Drug Authority Act. 
“The accused did not offer or lead any evidence to rebut this proposition in his defence, leaving the interference so strong that I had no doubt that the ingredient was proved to be classified drugs,” Mr Ereemye said. 
“Section 13 (1) National Drug Authority Act provides that no person shall mix, compound, prepare, supply or dispense any restricted drug unless that person is a registered pharmacist, medical practitioner, dentist, veterinary surgeon or licensed person.” 
“…The witnesses testified that the accused was found supplying these drugs to a doctor at Uganda Cancer Institute Complex in Mulago hospital although the doctor declined to testify in court as a condition for providing police with information. Therefore, I find that this fact was also proved,” he added. However, court acquitted the convict of importing drugs without licence because the prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence. 
Mr Ereemye adjourned the matter to April 12 for sentencing.
