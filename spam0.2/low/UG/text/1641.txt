Authorities in Bugiri District are investigating circumstances under which a 70-year-old man was on Monday (today) morning found murdered in his house. 
Mutwalib Bin Hamisi, a resident of Muyemu Village, Kapyanga Sub-county in Bugiri District, was reportedly attacked on Sunday night by unidentified assailants who left him with grievous wounds on the head, according to the area LCI chairperson, Mr Alamanzan Obando. 
The body, Mr Obando added, was discovered at around 7:30am by his daughter, Zubeda Bin Hamisi who had gone to pick a hoe from the deceased’s house to till her garden. She then raised an alarm that attracted locals to the scene. 
According to Mr Obando, the deceased had earlier been arraigned before the LCI Court by his son, Hamza Mutwalib who accused him of selling land that was given to him by his grandfather, Ayub Mugoya. The son has since disappeared following his father’s death.
