Crafty people have reportedly been soliciting for money from unsuspecting Mukono residents to allegedly have their names included on the list of people to receive animals under the President's Operation Wealth Creation (OWC).In a meeting with LC I and LC II chairmen of Mukono Central Division on Wednesday at the division headquarters at Upper Kauga zone, Major Moses Segujja who is also the chieftaincy of military intelligence (CMI) zonal intelligence officer (IO) disclosed that his office has received reports of conmen asking for money ranging from Shs250,000 to Shs50,000 from people so as to be included on the list of those to receive animals from OWC. 
The programme began with distribution of free planting seeds for maize and beans, tree seedlings and timber wood plantlets and has been distributing livestock including calves, piglets, chicken and improved breed goats."We have received reports of these conmen and, as I speak, we are about to make arrests. We are about to burst bases of cattle thieves in this division so if you have friends and relatives in this business, advise them to opt out," Segujja said. 
He advised local council leaders to sweet-talk former NAADS coordinators to re-apply for integration into the OWC to offer technical services, adding that they were not kicked out with disgrace because they were paid three months' salaries on discontinuation. advertisement
