Central African Republic demonstrators lay corpses in front of U.N. mission   
Hundreds of angry demonstrators on Wednesday laid the bodies of at least nine people killed in recent clashes in Central African Republic’s capital Bangui in front of the headquarters of the United Nation’s mission, a Reuters witness said. 
The peacekeeping mission, MINUSCA, said late on Tuesday that one Rwandan U.N. soldier was killed and eight others were wounded in clashes with armed groups in the PK5 neighbourhood, a Muslim area of the majority Christian city. //// Reuters
