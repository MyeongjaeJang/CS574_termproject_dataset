Kampala. Police have arrested the mother, brother and husband of the killed Luwum Street businesswoman Elizabeth Nakato in connection with her death.Nakato was abducted last Thursday evening and her body was recovered by residents of Matugga dumped at the border between Wakiso and Luweero districts on Friday afternoon. 
Kampala Metropolitan Police spokesperson Luke Owoyesigyire said their preliminary investigations reveal a simmering dispute between the deceased and her family members, including her mother, Nalongo Proscovia Najjuma, over a plot of land in Kira Municipality, Wakiso District.Nakato, according to police, had often refused to heed to her family’s decision to sell her late father’s land. 
Residents, according to police, have given testimonies allegedly linking the mother to her daughter’s death. One testimony accuses Ms Najjuma of allegedly hiring one Ronald to kill the deceased but she was at the time saved by residents who had learnt about the mission.“...we also arrested her brother, Pius Gamba, because he is being mentioned in the locals’ accounts of events that happened before her death,” Mr Owoyesigyire said. 
Another lead that police are closely following is a possible connivance between Nakato’s husband, Swaibu Ssegujja, and their maid, Racheal Namirembe, as the two have reportedly been having a love affair.However, Ms Namirembe, in her statement at police, said her boss (Nakato) had a piece of land in Mukono which she had gone to sell the day she disappeared. Mr Owoyesigyire said police will establish whether the thieves targeted the money obtained from selling the said plot.
