“There is increased business between Kenya and France. Looking back in 2012 there were only 35 French companies in Kenya. Now we have over 80 French companies with operations in Kenya and some of them have made Kenya their regional hub,” said Legre. 
The routes will include a Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Nairobi route, 7 Paris Charles de Gaulle and Nairobi flights and 7 other Amsterdam Schiphol to Nairobi frequencies route and 7 weekly flights between Amsterdam-Schiphol and Nairobi. ////Capital FM.
