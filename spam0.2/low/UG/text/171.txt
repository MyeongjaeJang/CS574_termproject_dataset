Former Assistant Minister for Animal Industry in the Milton Obote II regime Karegyesa Karekaho (Kham) has died aged 94. 
Recently, Karekaho was airlifted by chopper from his Rukungiri home and brought to International Hospital Kampala (IHK) for treatment. He was later taken back home. 
Until his death Karegyesa was among the few surviving former ministers of Milton Obote’s 1980s cabinet. 
“He was a very nice man; a man who was faithful to the party (UPC) and he was a nationalist who brought unity in Kigezi,” his cabinet colleague Dr. James Rwanyarare said, when contacted. 
Details of the burial will be communicated, a family source said. SHARE
