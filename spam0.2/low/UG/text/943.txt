SIM cards: UCC acting like a bully Advertisement By Paul Galandi 
Ever since the unfortunate murders of former police spokesperson Andrew Felix Kawesi and Susan Magara there have been many directives to telcom firms in connection with airtime and SIM card sales and registration. I presume that all the directives are made in good faith. However, the directives seem to be uncoordinated. 
Telecom business affects all of us in one way or the other. When a customer buys a SIM card or airtime, the telecom firm gets money, the customer makes a call. They also save time whereby instead of travelling to take or get a message, they simply call. 
Part of the money the telecoms get from the customer goes to URA to finance government activities and departments, including UCC and NIRA. 
This is why I call upon the above mentioned institutions to form a working committee to investigate the activities of the players and work towards arriving at an informed decisions that should be respected and implemented by all concerned. Otherwise, it seems UCC is acting like bully.
