Dear Paul, Please write about the Toyota Ist because it is one of my options for purchase. Please write especially about its cost at the bonds, fuel consumption, ground clearance, availability of spare parts and any other vital information. Jose Amooti 
Hello Amooti, the Toyota IST is a sub-compact car whose concept combined economy attributes of the mini hatch Toyota Vitz (Yaris) and the flexibility of bigger SUV vehicles. The popular first generation XP60 was built between 2002 and 2007 with an impressive sporty design and spacious comfortable seating space. Although the IST has limited boot space, it has a few tricks up its sleeves. When you split rear seats, they slide forward and backward, as well as fold forwards to produce a flat cargo area for larger loads. The intuitive interior design comes with an assortment of door-fitted bottle and cup holders with ample glove box space, complimented by a good audio stereo and air conditioning. 
Cost and maintenance At bonded warehouses, this car costs between Shs22m and Shs25m. The first maintenance service will cost you Shs80,000 for the first 100,000 kilometres while the first general service or renewal of the spark plugs, air cleaner, long life fuel filter, AC cabin filter, gear box (automatic transmission) fluid and engine coolant will cost about Shs500,000. Regular oil and filter changes will cost you about Shs90,000.Follow the Toyota recommended service interval of 5,000 kilometres and engine oil with viscosity grade 15W40 or the long life 5W30 fully synthetic oil. Preferably use engine oil with detergent additives which prevent sludge buildup and better protect the VVTi technology in your valve train. 
Performance and fuel The IST comes with two moderate performance engines whose attraction is economy. The 1.3 litre 2NZFE which delivers 84 horsepower @ 6,000 rpm and the 1.5 litre 1NZFE which delivers 109 horse power @ 6000 rpm(1NZXE comes with VVTi - Variable Valve Timing intelligent) to improve fuel efficiency and emissions. Average fuel economy statistics of the 1.3 litre IST are 18 KM/L on the highway and 16.3 KM/L in the city. The 1.5 litre IST average fuel economy on the highway is 16.6 KM/L and in city traffic about 14 KM/L. These statistics presuppose that the car engine is well tuned and tires in good condition. advertisement
