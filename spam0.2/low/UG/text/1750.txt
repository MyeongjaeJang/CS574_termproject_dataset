Government through the Ministry of Trade and Cooperatives has threatened to allow cheap imported cement into the country if local cement manufacturers do not lower prices.Trade minister Amelia Kyambadde says the manufacturers in Uganda have up to three weeks to lower the prices which have attracted public outcry. 
"We have given them an opportunity until May. If by May the prices have not gone down but even May is very far. We also have to protect them because these are the few industries that we have," said Ms Kyambadde while meeting the manufacturers in Kampala on Tuesday. 
The prices of a bag of cement and other manufactured building materials have on average increased by between Shs5,000 and Shs11,000 within a month, triggering a country-wide crisis in the construction sector.Some retailers, according to our surveys, are hoarding or rationing stocks and many are hiking prices to cash in on the crisis amid panic buying by prospective home owners.

The two biggest cement producers; Tororo Cement factory in eastern Uganda and Hima Cement in Kasese, which collectively account for 80 per cent of the market share, blamed declined production on reduced electricity supply. They, however, declined to share specific information on the amount of electricity required to power their machineries for optimal output against what they are currently receiving. 
Mr Morgan Gagranihe, the Tororo Cement factory executive director in a recent interview with our reporter, said their production is down by 600,000 tonnes to 1.2 million which, combined with increased competition for raw material by cement producers, has constrained output. advertisement
