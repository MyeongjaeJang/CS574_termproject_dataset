Ugandan Envoy to Saudi Arabia Ssemuddu Accused of Domestic Violence   
Uganda’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Rashid Yahya Ssemuddu has been dragged to Kajjansi Police Station over domestic violence. Lukia Abdu Rahman accuses her husband of repetitive beatings even over minor issues. 
“It doesn’t matter whether the kids are around or not. He keeps beating me up. For long, I have endured assaults by this man. The situation is now unbearable,” she told police on Monday. Amb Ssemuddu said his wife and colleagues hatched a plot to destroy his reputation. - Advertisement - 
“She knew what she was doing because she was sent to provoke me,” said the envoy. “She grabbed me by the neck and all I did was defend myself. Going to police was meant to destroy my reputation,” he added. 
CIID Spokesperson Vincent Ssekate said law enforcement officers were “examining the merits of her complaint as she receives treatment for wounds suffered from alleged domestic violence.” - Advertisement -
