KAMPALA. 
With the Azam Uganda Premier League (AUPL) in its final bend, the term “must win” is going to be used often for the clubs at the top and the bottom of the log.One such scenario occurs today as reigning champions KCCA and UPDF clash in the sole topflight game at the Startimes Stadium.With 10 games left, KCCA go into the game on 40 points, six behind leaders SC Villa. But with two games in hand, the holders need maximum points this afternoon to keep their rivals that include Vipers who are two points and a game better off, in sight.“We are playing a league that has about four title contenders and we know we have to win our games to defend the title. Today’s result did not go our way but we need to keep going in the next games coming up, KCCA manager Mike Mutebi said after his team’s 1-1 draw against Mbarara last week.UPDF are expected to pose a similar threat in their bid to survive the drop as they sit six points above the relegation spots.“About eight teams are still fighting to avoid the drop and it would be arrogant of us to say we have already survived. We need about three more wins,” UPDF coach Steven Bogere.He has presided over a run of one defeat in 10 games after failing to win any of his first seven games in charge.“I asked my bosses to allow me make changes to the team because I found a number of players who lacked ambition,” Bogere added.He made up to eight new additions and will rely on the likes of Robert Nakyenalire, Joseph Janjali and Isa Mubiru to wreck havoc in the KCCA ranks.The champions though remain unbeaten at their Lugogo fortress and could welcome back striker Muhammad Shaban.
