PHOTO UG PARLIAMENT MEDIA Kampala, Uganda | GODFREY SSALI | The newly elected Member of Parliament for Jinja Municipality East Paul Mwiru has been sworn in to start his legislative work in Uganda’s 10 th parliament. The oath was Tuesday administered by the Clerk to Parliament Jane Kibirige, before parliament presided over by the deputy speaker of parliament Jacob Oulanya. Mwiru who represents opposition Forum for Democratic Change won the Jinja East by-election after trouncing his closest rival also ruling National Resistance Movement’s Nathan Igeme Nabeta with 6654 votes (56%) against Nabeta’s 5043 votes (42%).. Mwiru who took the oath amidst chants from fellow MPs and supporters in the parliament gallery was later handed a copy of the Constitution and parliament rules of procedure to guide his work. The seat fell vacant in January following a Court of Appeal ruling that upheld an earlier ruling by the Jinja High Court which overturned Nabeta’s win because of rigging through falsification of election results at Danida A-D polling station, which put him (Nabeta) at an advantage in the February 2016 elections. Hon Paul Mwiru has been sworn in as the new MP for Jinja East Municipality, following victory in a by-election that was held in mid-March, 2018.
