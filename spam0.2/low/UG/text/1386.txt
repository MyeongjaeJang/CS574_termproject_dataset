BUL CEO suspends Kisala, BIDCO boss to make final decision 6 hours ago News Fred Mwambu Coach Kefa Kisala has again found himself at loggerheads with the BUL FC’s hierarchy after a spate of poor performances and misunderstandings. The club bowed out of the Uganda Cup last week after losing to lower tier side Kampala Junior Team. The exit was followed by another 3-1 disappointing loss to Soana in Kavumba despite the Jinja side leading early in the game. Players revolt “It’s true the CEO [Salmin Saleh] had suspended me for three games but the matter will be looked into today by Mr. Gosh [ Suvrajit, Bidco Uganda general manager],” Kisala revealed to FUtaa in an exclusive interview. Kisala revealed that the main reason he was suspended is what the CEO termed as disrespect towards the team manager, Dauda Were. “We went for KJT match very disorganized; first we went very late, second, we reached there and had no uniforms and water for the players, so I told him [Dauda] that he was not doing his job as required. “He went on to cancel the players’ allowance [because of that loss] and they tried to revolt back. They refused to train until all their allowance was wired to them. “That issue dragged on until Monday when they were assured that the money will be paid. So, that led to very poor preparations for Soana game which we lost.” Kisala is currently in his second stint at the Jinja-based club. The first ended in bad blood in February 2015 after the same officials –Dauda Were and Salmin- Saleh crossed with the coach. His successor, Alex Isabirye also left under similar circumstances. The club sits 8 th on the log with 28 points after 22 games. If the club owners maintain his suspension, Kisala will miss league games against Vipers (H), Mbarara City (A) and UPDF (A).
