April 14, 2018 Kabaka Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II 
The Kabaka of Buganda Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II has urged the government to organise local council elections in a bid to tackle the security challenges in the country. 
Speaking at Villa Maria Catholic Parish in Masaka, the Kabaka noted that government had failed to organize Local Council (LC I) leadership for over 16 years citing lack of funds, but hastened to add that LC are basis of security in the country. 
Kabaka Mutebi, who was in Villa Maria for his 63 rd birthday celebrations, was received by among other dignitaries Katikiro Charles Peter Mayiga and entertained by various cultural troupes. 
“We have witnessed the killings of people in Masaka among other areas where attackers issue notices days before they raid, kill and inflict grievance harm to victims, I condole all who have lost their loved ones,” the Kabaka told hundreds of people gathered. 
The Kabaka’s statement comes in awake of rampant kidnaps, torture and killing of victims, including that of Susan Magara, who was killed after her family failed to raise a US$1 million ransom to have her freed. 
In the recent past there have also been other indiscriminate killings including the serial murders of women in Entebbe and Wakiso districts. Post Views: 138
