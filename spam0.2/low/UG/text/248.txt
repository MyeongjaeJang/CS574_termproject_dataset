The plan, which is currently in its advanced stages, will see KCCA remain with a few health centre IVs such as Kiswa, Kitebi, Kawaala and Kisenyi once Cabinet approves the takeover by the Health ministry. 
Kawempe and Kiruddu hospitals, previously health centre IVs under KCCA, were upgraded to referral hospitals, with funding from African Development Bank (AfDB) and the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF). In an interview with this newspaper on Monday, Health ministry permanent secretary Diana Atwine confirmed a plan to have the two hospitals overseen by her ministry. “We are going to take over Kawempe and Kiruddu hospitals but Cabinet will first discuss the matter before final decision is taken on the matter,” she said.
