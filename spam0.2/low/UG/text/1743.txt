City socialite Brian Kirumira alias Bryan White hit the Ugandan social scene with a bang and within a few months of him splashing money to whoever could say his name, he was the number one selling being discussed on all local tabloids. It looked like he was going to be stuck in our faces for a very long time until something unexpected happened. He was arrested for attempted murder, an offence that attracts a maximum penalty of life imprisonment according to Uganda’s Penal Code. 
Right at the time when he was cementing his position in Uganda's social life, White and his bodyguard Thomas Okot were remanded to Luzira Maximum security prisons for attempting to kill his neighbour, Victor Bitwire. The duo were reported to have shot Bitwire on the night of December 13 last year in Munyonyo.
