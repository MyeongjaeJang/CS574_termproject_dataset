Since January, Sudan has shut its eastern border with Eritrea, days after Khartoum declared an emergency in the state of Kasala.Officials say the decision to declare emergency was part of a government campaign to collect illegal arms in the state.Hundreds of Sudanese soldiers have been deployed in Kasala in recent months, residents say.Thousands of Eritreans, fleeing a repressive regime at home, cross into Sudan illegally through the border with Kasala every year and later make perilous voyages across the Mediterranean to Europe.Apart from Kasala, a state of emergency is in place in Sudan's war-torn regions of Darfur, Blue Nile, South Kordofan and North Kordofan. advertisement
