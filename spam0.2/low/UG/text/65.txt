March 19, 2018 Abdallah Kitatta with his co-accused in the dock at Makindye 
Abdallah Kitatta, the patron for Boda Boda 2010 motorcyclists, has today appeared before Makindye General Court Martial (GCM), charged with the illegal possession of ammunitions. 
Kitatta is currently facing five counts including failure to protect war material and being in unlawful possession of military stores contrary to the UPDF Act. 
His co-accused include Sowali Ngobi, Amon Twinomujuni, Joel Kibirige, Matia Ssenfuka, Hassan Ssebata and Johnson Kayondo. The others are Hassan Ssengoba, Sunday Ssemogerere, John Ssebandeke, Hussein Mugema, Fred Bwanika and Ibrahim Sekajja. 
Kitatta was arrested by a joint force of Uganda People’s Defence Forces (UPDF) and Internal Security Organization (ISO), and appearing before the GCM chaired by Lt Gen Andrew Guti, prosecution led by Staff Sergeant Raphael Mugisha sought adjournment to April 23. 
Earlier, Shaban Sanywa, appearing for Kitatta, asked for transfer of his client from military barracks where he is detained to Luzira prison, arguing that his client is not receiving treatment. 
But GCM chairman Lt Gen Guti said that due to the nature of Kitatta’s case, the latter is supposed to be detained in a military prison. SHARE
