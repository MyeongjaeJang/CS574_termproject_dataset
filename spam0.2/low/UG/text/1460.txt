Gold Coast, Australia | THE INDEPENDENT | Captain Peace Proscovia was the star with 35 goals as Ugandaâ€™s netballers snatched a first win in their tough Group B at the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games on Saturday. 
Ugandan netballers, competing at their first Commonwealth Games, recovered from Thursdayâ€™s opening day 64-51 defeat by New Zealand to tame Malawi 54-52 in a thrilling game. Ugandaâ€™s She Cranes are African champions while Malawi are the continentâ€™s top ranked team in the world, one ahead of Proscoviaâ€™s team at 6th. 
In the second straight game, the tall and agile Proscovia remained a model of consistency under the Uganda hoop while receiving solid support from goal attack Rachel Nanyonga. The defeated Malawians were left in tears at the final whistle. A few of the Malawi #netball players in tears and declined interviews as they made their way through the mixzone after the 54-52 points defeat to Uganda. Tough loss. They were level with minutes to go in the final quarter. #GC2018 #commgames2018 #bbcgoldcoast

Nanyonga grabbed 19 goals as Uganda got off to an early lead, 18-10 in first quarter, 30-25 in quarter 2, 42-39 in quarter 3 before holding on to win 54-52 after a late surge by Malawi. 
No 7-ranked Uganda return to action on Sunday against another fancied side, England ranked 3, on Sunday. 
Uganda is represented at the Commonwealth Games by teams in netball, swimming, rugby, squash, athletics, shooting, badminton, boxing and cycling. 
Athletics remains Ugandaâ€™s main hope for medals, and the tone of the countryâ€™s performance at this Commonwealth Games will be set in the eventâ€™s day-one when Joshua Cheptegei runs in the 5000m final on Sunday. 
Cheptegei came close to gold at the World Championships 10,000m race last year, edged by Mo Farah in a tough final. He skipped his favourite 5000m race due to fatigue at the World Championships, and the schedule this time makes him a firm bet to do the double. 
The double was achieved by Moses Kipsiro in Delhi in 2010, winning the 5000 and 10,000m gold. 
Uganda has taken part in every Games since 1954 (with exception of 1978) and has this time sent a team of 69 to compete.
