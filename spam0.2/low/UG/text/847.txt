Mr Zomahoun urged African governments to invest more in science, technology and research as well as the required infrastructure. He added that Africans should not only be consumers of global technology, but also inventors and managers of technologies. 
The three-day forum, which brings together about 1,200 scientists, policymakers, business and civil society leaders, and entrepreneurs focuses on highlighting the contributions of Africa’s scientists and innovators to the global community. 
The Next Einstein Forum (NEF) is an initiative of the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in partnership with Robert Bosch Stiftung, a German charitable institution. Launched in 2013, the NEF aims to connect science, society and policy in Africa and the rest of the world – with the goal to leverage science for human development. ///The East African
