Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Uganda’s poultry farmers will soon resume selling their products to the neighbouring Kenya after nearly a15-month ban. 
The Kenyan government on March 22 said it plans to lift the ban soon, allowing Uganda’s chicken and egg products access itsKsh500milliom market. 
Kenya banned the entry of Uganda’s products many months ago following the outbreak of a viral disease. 
Deputy Director of Veterinary Services, Michael Cheruiyot, says the move follows talks with Uganda and an assessment that ascertained the neighbouring country is now free of avian influenza disease. 
Last year in August, the Ministry of Agriculture allowed three firms to export their products to Kenya having met the safety conditions that would allow them to sell their eggs and chickens locally, locking out majority of the traders in the cross-border poultry business. Share on:
