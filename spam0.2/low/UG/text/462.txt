57 city schools lack land titles Advertisement By AMOS NGWOMOYA 
Kampala. 
At least 57 out of 79 city government aided primary schools under the jurisdiction of Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) do not have land titles, according to the State minister for Kampala Affairs, Ms Benny Namugwanya.The lack of land titles, KCCA officials say, could see these schools evicted hence leaving learners stranded.The minister said they have since applied to Uganda Land Commission and other relevant bodies to give them land titles for the affected schools.‘It’s a time bomb which we must address now because the future of our children in these schools is at stake since they face eviction if we don’t secure land titles. We hope the Ministry of Lands will expedite this process, Ms Namugwanya said yesterday.However, the minister accused some schools’ administrators of conniving with investors to grab land belonging to schools, warning that anybody who will fall victim to the theft of school land will face the law.She also referred to the recent land probe commission chaired by Justice Catherine Bamugemereire, faulting the Nakasero school administration in the manner in which Nakasero Primary School playground was sold off to city businessmen, Sudhir Ruparelia and Ephraim Ntaganda. 
Arrests“You can’t tell me that land belonging to a school can be sold off without the knowledge of the school administrators. How? They must be having a hand in how these transactions and this is what we want to stop as government by arresting all those found guilty,” Ms Namugwanya said.Of the 79 schools, only four schools sit on land owned by KCCA while 22 schools have so far received lease offers from the various controlling authorities while 57 are sitting on temporary land, and they could soon be displaced by the owners of the land.Saturday Monitor has learnt that the lease offers to the 18 schools were given by the Uganda Land Commission and four were from the Buganda Land Board (BLB).Some city schools have previously been demolished under unclear circumstances, paving way for the construction of high-rise buildings. For instance, Shimoni and Nnabagereka primary schools were demolished amid uproar from the public.The Minister of Lands, Ms Betty Amongi, said the procession of land titles to schools is being delayed by shortage of funds, which she says, must cater for surveying and titling.“All the bills for titling land belonging to primary schools are paid by the Local Government while that of secondary school and other higher institutions are paid by the Ministry of Education. In this case, city schools fall under KCCA and it’s therefore the one supposed to pay the costs for processing the land titles,” she said.Ms Amongi noted that when funds are available, the land titles will be processed, adding that she has previously presented the same matter before Cabinet. advertisement
