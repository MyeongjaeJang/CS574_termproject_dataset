Why do I get periods twice? My periods come twice a month yet I have never taken contraceptives Advertisement By Dr Vincent Karuhanga 
My periods come twice a month yet I have never taken contraceptives. Is it a serious condition that can stop me from getting pregnant? Hajara 
Dear Hajara,Much as they are called monthly periods, menstruation does not follow calendar months. Infact, a woman may have her periods anywhere from 21 to 35 days with the average being 28 days. If the period is short, this can lead to a woman having periods twice a month. In your case, because period cycles were taking longer, you were having them once a month but when the cycle became shorter, it changed. 
However, this is still normal and can happen without any health issues that may affect the likelihood of getting pregnant. However, sometimes a woman may have normal periods and then have bleeding or spotting for a day or two during ovulation, which then may be mistaken for having periods twice a month. 
If one has irregular periods as happens due to hormonal problems, periods may come unexpectedly at any time and this may then be associated with other health problems including infertility. Any unusual vaginal bleeding calls for a PAP smear to rule out cancer of the cervix. advertisement
