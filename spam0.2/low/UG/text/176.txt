March 20, 2018 TRIBUTE: The late Mayombo, (2nd left) Mzee Wamoto, Noah Mukhwana in wheel chair 
Brig. Gen. Noble Mayombo, we recognise the void you left in my familyâ€™s life cycle. 
Exactly 11 years ago today, on March 20, 2007 you handed me the money you had humbly collected in your own co-ordinated fund-raiser to help in the medication of my then bed ridden son, Noah Mukhwana, only for you to abruptly pass on 42 days later, leaving us in Mulago Hospital. 
Your efforts were not in vain though. 
In your absence Gen. Mayombo, Mukhwana gathered his life pieces together, beating all the odds to graduate from Kyambogo University, and if you were alive, you would have been Guest of Honour . 
While you were away, life created its own dynamics both harsh and challenging but also presented new friends with benefits like you. 
The National Social Security Fund (NSSF) has for the last 4 months followed up ours story which we have ably relayed on your behalf to millions of people that you knew and those you did not know the world over, and we promise to keep the story alive forever. 
Rest in peace dear friend.
