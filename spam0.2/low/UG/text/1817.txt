WHO: 500 people have been affected by a chemical in Syria   
The World Health Organization (WHO) has demanded “unhindered access” to Douma in Syria, to check reports from its partners that 500 people have been affected by a chemical attack there. The Syrian government denies being behind any chemical attack. 
The US has threatened a “forceful” response to reports of an attack but Russia has called this a “pretext” to attack its ally, Syria. The WHO said more than 70 people had reportedly died after the attack. ///BBC
