The Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA) has demolished Bivamuntuuyo Market at Kalerwe in Kawempe Division, Kampala to pave way for the expansion works of the Kampala Northern Bypass project. 
“It's important to note that all affected parties in this exercise have been duly compensated, informed and engaged on this development. We therefore anticipate cooperation throughout the exercise,” UNRA’s media relations manager, Mr Allan Sempebwa said. 
The demolition has affeced hundreds of vendors selling mostly fresh foodstuffs, including fruits and vegetables. 
But with the planned roadwork, the survival of the vendors hangs in balance since they depend on the market for their livelihood.
