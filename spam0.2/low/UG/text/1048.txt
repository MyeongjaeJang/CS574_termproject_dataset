There was drama at St. Paul's Cathedral Namirembe this morning when a man identified as Herbert Kadu stormed the Easter prayer service clad in a back-cloth. 
According to information obtained by this reporter, Kadu came driving a Super Custom vehicle and parked it at the Church's main entrance before jumping out.He beat Police security and gained entry into the cathedral. All was well until the end of the service when Kadu ran through the main corridor of the church holding a big stick to the Holy Altar and dived in. 
The ushers in the cathedral attempted to stop him in vain. He was later overpowered by police and whisked off to Namirembe Police Post for interrogations. Bishop Wilberforce Kityo Luwalira of Namirembe Diocese says the man looked possessed and couldn't be stopped. "I have seen the power of darkness during my service as Bishop but the most powerful thing is that I have seen the power of God," said Luwalira. He said they can't blame security officers attached to the church since such incidents happen to even to high profile people with heavy security, adding that church doesn't have a guest list since it is a place of prayers where people are not invited. He promised to cause a meeting with the security officers to identify the security lapses and Kadu's motive. Luke Oweyisigire, the Kampala Metropolitan Police Spokesman, says the man is being interrogated. advertisement
