The Director of Interpol Fred Yiga has warned the public against consuming counterfeit goods on the market, saying they might have far reaching consequences in their later in their lives.Yiga sounded the warning while displaying counterfeit goods impounded during a week-long operation in downtown Kampala at Interpol headquarters in Kololo. 
During the joint operation, various goods including oil lubricants, foods, mattresses, electronics and books were impounded.“You can buy such a mattress for your child and you may never know that the problem they might have acquired was from the counterfeit mattres,” Yiga said as he pushed his finger into a fake mattress with ease.“You buy an extension and when you use it, it starts sparking and before you know it, there is a fire. Then you blame neighbours for setting your house on fire. The problem is the fake power extension you bought,” Yiga said holding up the fake extension. 
He warned the public that somethings on market were cheap but have far reaching consequences on their lives. According to him vehicles were breaking down often because of fake lubricant oils on market. Yiga took a swipe at brand owners to take steps to protect their brands and the public. According to Yiga, counterfeiting was thriving because of greed. He vowed to continue with the operation. Others agencies like URSB, UNBS, URA and Police took part in the operation. advertisement
