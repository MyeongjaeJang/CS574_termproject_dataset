Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | In a study published in the journal `Evolutionary Psychological Science’, scientists have discovered an interesting connection between atheism and certain genetic traits, including left-handedness, schizophrenia, and autism. 
It all comes down to the DNA and something they refer to as “mutational load”. Essentially, people who identify as religious tend to have fewer genetic mutations. 
They are, therefore, less likely than their non-religious peers to be left-handed, according to lead author Edward Dutton of the Ulster Institute for Social Research. Share on:
