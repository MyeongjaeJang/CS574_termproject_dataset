Fufa Big League: Odoch calms promotion talk for Nyamityobora Advertisement By George Katongole 
Kampala. James Odoch has stated that Nyamityobora have not achieved anything yet as talk continues to hype up their super league promotion credentials.Nyamityobora are comfortably atop of the Rwenzori group with 36 points and a game in hand against second-placed Kira, who can temporarily go top today when they play Kabale Sharp. 
But Kitara and Bumate are breathing down the leader’s neck to ensure a tight finish in the Big League.With just seven games remaining, Nyamityobora have four home fixtures to Kireka, Ntinda, Kitara and Water while their three visits take them to Kira, Greater Masaka and hard nuts Bumate. 
Docca spot-kick Sunday’s 1-0 win courtesy of a Musa Docca penalty over Synergy ensured that all three points have been bagged at home all season but the jury is still out on if they can go the whole season fighting at the top. Fellow contenders Kitara fell 3-0 when they visited Bumate in Bundibugyo.“We only need to continue the momentum. Of course any mistakes can cost us now because we haven’t achieved anything yet,” he said. 
Kira’s coach mark Twinamasiko, whose side plays their second away game against Kabale Sharp today after just a day’s rest, vowed to keep the push.“The journey from Bundibugyo to Kabale has taken its toll on the players but what matters now are maximum points.Elsewhere, Kyetume beat Dove All Stars 2-0 despite the game kicking off at 5:20pm after referees delayed to arrive.
