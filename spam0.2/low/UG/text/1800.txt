A man in Kayunga District has been sentenced to life imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to charges of human sacrifice. 
Hassan Isiiko, a resident of Bulyankuyege in Buyoba Sub County, Kayunga District was on Monday sentenced to life imprisonment by the Mukono High court Judge, Ms Margaret Mutonyi, after he pleaded guilty to have sacrificed his neighbor Yakobo Kayizzi 84. 
Prosecution led by Ms Ann Kabajungu told court that the accused committed the offence on May 24, 2013. Ms Kabajungu added that Isiiko went to the deceased's home and found him busy sorting beans and he pretended to be helping him and hit him on the head with a big stick which left him in a bad condition. 
Prosecution told court that Isiiko then cut off the deceased's head and private parts and took off abandoning the body in the compound. 
Isiiko pleaded guilty and asked court to forgive him claiming that he thought he would get riches. 
While giving her sentence, Justice Mutonyi said that what Isiiko did is a bad and dangerous act and so he is not fit to stay in the society. 
Justice Mutonyi also said that human sacrifice does not make one rich but rather a miserable life. advertisement
