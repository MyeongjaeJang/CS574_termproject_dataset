Floods at Entebbe Airport -CAA speaks out   
Pictures of water flooding hallways at Entebbe Airport terminal building started making rounds on Monday, sparking comments questioning how this could have happened at the national airport. 
The CAA Spokesperson Vienne Luggya however, says floods were as a result of a blocked drainage channel from the site of the ongoing construction works. - Advertisement - 
“There was a heavy downpour last night and the water blocked one of the channels with debris from the construction site, leading the waters into the terminal” he said. Luggya says the incident happened only temporarily, adding that it was quickly rectified. The upgrade and expansion of the Airport is a design and build project to be implemented in a phased approach over a 5 Year span. 
The Minister of Works and Transport, Monica Azuba Ntege while touring the site last year said the progress on the project was about 28 percent. 
Azuba said the project aims at increasing more arrivals, cargos and will boost the country economically in areas such as tourism. - Advertisement -
