RUKIGA- Property worth millions of shillings has been destroyed in Muhanga Town Council in Rukiga District, after a heavy down pour that left most parts of the town flooded on Monday. Rukiga Resident District Resident Commissioner Mr Emmy Ngabirano said several stores were flooded damaging cereals, peas, beans among other items but no life was lost. Mr Ngabirano asked local leaders to compile the magnitude of the loss to enable him make a report that will be taken to the Office of the Prime Minister for possible assistance. “The fact that Muhanga Town Council is located in a valley, running water from nearby hills ended up flooding the whole area. We appeal to local leaders to launch a tree planting campaign to prevent slides and soil erosion,” Mr Ngabirano said. Ms Reginah Kobuganzi, a resident of the area said that a similar calamity happened eight years ago. advertisement
