By 7:00am,SFC operatives had closed off the busy Parliament Avenue and adjacent roads, cathching motorists unawares and forcing them to make dangerous U-turns in the middle of roads, triggering chaotic traffic snarl-ups. No prior notice was given to motorists on social media warning about the planned closure of the roads and matters were made worse that Museveni who was expected at Parliament by 9:00am showed up way past 3:00pm.
