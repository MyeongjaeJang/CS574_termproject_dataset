By press time details of the meeting between the two presidents were scanty but officials had earlier indicated the talks would focus on bilateral relations. Presidents Paul Kagame and Yoweri Museveni and members of their respective delegations at State House Entebbe today 
Kagame’ visit comes at a time when relations between Rwanda and Uganda are reportedly frosty following a series of events officials from both countries say are aimed at undermining each other’s sovereignty. 
And just last week President Museveni failed to attend the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Summit in Kigali, reportedly on the advice of his ‘advance team’. 
The two presidents, former comrades-in-arms during the bush war between 1981 and 1985 that brought the National Resistance Movement/Army (NRM/A) government to power in 1986 last met at the AU Heads of State Summit in Addis Ababa early this year. SHARE
