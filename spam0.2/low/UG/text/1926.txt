GOLD COAST. 
The sweet science of boxing has so often courted controversy whenever judges have made decisions that raised eye brows.Uganda has been a victim at Commonwealth and Olympic Games level many times in the past and Juma Miiro, who fights India’s Amit in tonight’s semi-final in the men’s 46-49kgs, is fully aware.“The trick is to score a decisive win to avoid dodgy decisions from judges,” Miiro observed yesterday.“It is important to start very strongly to win over the minds of the judges.” 
Decisive winsMiiro, who outpointed Kenya’s Shaffi Hassan in the last round, takes on Amit whose victims in the previous rounds were Ghana’s Tetteh Sulemanu and Scotland’s Aqeel Ahmed. Both were decisive wins.Amit is not known to Miiro, but the Ugandan remains confident. “I will not let him get hold of the fight because my goal is to win gold in Gold Coast.”Miiro is the only Ugandan boxer still standing in Gold Coast, something which has given his training regime an awkward feel.“Previously we were running together and training as one but after they were knocked out of competition, I have to go through sessions myself which is a bit odd. But my focus remains the same.” Miiro’s dream is to turn professional soon, a dream which can only be realised with more impressive bouts at the Commonwealth Games.“The money is in the paid ranks and I will not stop working hard to live that professional dream.”
