Two students of Uringi Secondary school have this morning died after the truck they were traveling in overturned on Goli-Nebbi road. The students mainly members of Young Christian Students (YCS) were traveling from their school in Goli to Nebbi Cathedral Catholic Parish for the annual Music Dance and Drama Competition festival. According to the Regional Police Public Relations Officer, Ms Josephine Angucia, the truck was carrying 45 students and so far two of them are confirmed dead. 
She identified the deceased as Isaac Manano of senior four and Linda Akech of senior three. “Police visited the scene and the injured students have all been taken to Goli health centre IV and Nebbi hospital. Investigations are still underway,” she said. 
Seventeen students are undergoing treatment at Goli Health Center IV. Recently, the police had banned students from using Lorries as transport to or from any school function. The police advised the school authorities to hire buses for any school function. Their directive followed numerous accidents involving students who board school trucks. Some of the schools are financially handicapped and cannot afford to buy buses as a section of parents are also unwilling to contribute money for buses. editorial@ug.nationmedia.com
