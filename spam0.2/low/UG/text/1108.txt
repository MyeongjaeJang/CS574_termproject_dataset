While welcoming President Paul Kagame at State House Entebbe recently, President Museveni appeared with a bandaged right hand, some Ugandans got concerned. One such was Tom Jones, who took to twitter to ask the president whether all was well. 
‘‘I am, since 1976, an amateur Karate practitioner. Those exercises help in fitness even when I come from office at midnight. I do the exercises, once in a while. I sprained my wrist.’’ The president said on Sunday while responding to a number of issues via his twitter handle. - Advertisement - 
Mr. Museveni explained that the hand is now healing.’ ‘The Karate skills were part of the unarmed ones that are acquired in the security forces even today.’’ He added. August last year, President Museveni declared that he has not fallen sick for all the time he has been the president of Uganda. 
“Have you ever heard that Museveni has fallen sick and my legs hanged in hospital, for the last 31 years? This is because I observe some of these health tips which have eventually helped me to prevent some of these diseases. Many of the diseases are preventable,” Mr Museveni said. “Most diseases that overwhelm these hospitals and health centres can be prevented if the people can improve on their hygiene and sanitation, because 75 per cent of cases registered are preventable,” Mr Museveni said adding that that practices like carrying out immunisations, drinking clean safe water, hygiene and sanitation, good nutrition, desisting from over drinking of alcohol and also sleeping under treated mosquito nets could be some of the best practices to prevent diseases. 
The President made the remarks in Budaka District during the historical official launch of the Lugwere Bible at a highly-billed function at Budaka Ssaza grounds.
