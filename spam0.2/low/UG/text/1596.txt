Manila, Philippines | AFP | Clad in underwear, loincloths, tutus or body paint, hundreds of semi-naked young people pounded the streets of Manila on Sunday in an unusual race that brought a sweaty spectacle to the capital of the conservative, mainly Catholic Philippines. 
The city’s first-ever “Underpants Run” drew crowds from dawn as around a thousand runners in skimpy outfits jogged and sprinted around an upscale shopping district in balmy weather. 
“It was a feast for the eyes… people were hyped,” 30-year-old runner Ronald Tugade told AFP after completing a five-kilometre (three-mile) segment of the course. 
“Bystanders asked why we were dressed that way,” said the IT engineer, who said he had clocked in at a relatively slow 26 minutes because he was somewhat distracted by the many “guys with abs, as well as sexy women” around him. 
The race, which participants could choose to run at three, five or 10 kilometres, also attracted a number of local celebrities, with one popular actor and go-karting driver mobbed by female runners. 
“Of course you have to get your body toned for it, but there was no body shaming. All participants were welcome,” said Tugade. 
While more daring participants wore G-strings and body paint, others opted for silly costumes such as grass skirts and baby-blue ballet tutus. 
“Everyone stripped down to their birthday suits or dressed up to the nines — there were feathers, Egyptian costumes, superhero masks and odes to traditional (tribal loincloths),” said a post on the fitness website multisport.ph, the run’s co-sponsor. Share on:
