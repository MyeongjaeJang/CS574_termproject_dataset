KAMPALA. Police have refuted allegations of closing Nalufenya Detention Centre in Jinja District. The deputy police spokesman, Superintendent of Police Patrick Onyango, said the Inspector General of Police Martins Okoth Ochola has not made any directives to close the facility. "The Inspector General of Police normally writes his orders and directives but this (on closure of Nalufenya) has not been done," Mr Onyango said in a statement. There have been allegations circulating across some media platforms that the detention centre has been closed. Mr Onyango clarified that the status of the facility was discussed by the Police Advisory Committee on Wednesday but no decision was reached on whether to close it or not. Nalufenya Detention Centre, which was formerly a police station, was established by the former IGP Gen Kale Kayihura at the height of killing Muslim clerics in eastern Uganda. The facility was used to detain violent and high profile criminals. The facility was used by Special Operations Unit officers to interrogate suspects.
