JINJA - A group of technicians who operate on Oboja Road in Jinja District are counting losses after fire gutted their workshop on Tuesday morning. 
Mr Moses Lubega, the owner of the workshop said when he arrived at his place of work at about 7:00am, he saw black smoke bellowing out of the building and called police after realising that there was a fire outbreak. 
“Police did respond within 10 minutes, but unfortunately, the first fire truck that came had no water; so the driver had to leave it and rush to the station to get another one. A few things were rescued but the fridges were all burnt,” Mr Lubega said.He said what was lost is worth millions of money 
According to Mr Lubega, the fire was caused by an electric circuit from one of the rooms where fridges and gas cylinders are kept.
