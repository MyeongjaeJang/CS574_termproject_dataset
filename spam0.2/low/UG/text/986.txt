Kampala. 
Three foreigners have been cited in grabbing Christopher Obey’s land, whose title is being held as an exhibit in ongoing cases against him in Mubende District, Daily Monitor has learnt.These are Ms Jane Uwamaria and Mr David Mfitumukiza of Rwandan origin and Mr Yusuf Muhabwenyayo, a Burundian national.Mr Obey is a former Public Service ministry principal accountant, who was convicted and is serving a 10-year jail sentence for embezzling pension funds.This newspaper last week broke a story of how Mubende District officials in the lands registry allegedly sold off close to 6,400 acres of Obey’s land yet the same land is being held as an exhibit in ongoing cases against him. The land comprises several plots in blocks 357, 393 and 357/38.Court on September 9, 2016 and again on November 28, 2017 placed a caveat forbidding any transactions on the land located in Buwekula, Mubende District. 
Confusion The sale of the land has triggered confusion among government officials in the justice, law and order sector.Kampala District Land Board chairperson Yusuf Nsibambi said no individual can be a bonafide on the land with a caveat.He said a buyer would have “bought hot air”, when referring to reported transactions on Obey’s land.Daily Monitor understands there is an ongoing clash between government officials over the sale of the same land. However, CID deputy director Joseph Obwona has since questioned the legality of the transactions.For instance, he ordered the Mubende DPC in a March 15, letter to “ensure that each encroacher account for his or her presence on the land” and establish the “legality of issuance of land titles to new registered owners”. advertisement
