President Paul Kagame on Tuesday officiated the swearing ceremony of new government officials. The new officials include Dr. Claudine Uwera, the new Minister of State in Charge of Planning in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (Minecofin); Col. Jeannot Kibezi Ruhunga, the Secretary-General of Rwanda Investigation Bureau and Isabelle Kalihangabo, the Bureau’s Deputy Secretary-General. 
Speaking at the event, Kagame stressed that senior government officials taking the oath of office during a time when Rwandans commemorate the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsis serves as a reminder of the huge task ahead. “This swearing-in takes place during a period that reminds us of the huge responsibility we have as leaders of rebuilding our country,” he remarked. - Advertisement - 
“We do not talk about nation building merely because it is a good thing; it should be our identity. This fight that we have been involved in for the last 24 years must be sustained; otherwise who else do we expect to fight it on our behalf?” The President reminded current and incoming senior officials that the interests of Rwandans come before anything else, and urged them to always strive to deliver results that benefit the country and its citizens. 
‘ ‘We thank these leaders for accepting these responsibilities and assure you of our cooperation. We must work as if we are working for ourselves; putting the interests of all Rwandans before anything else. When we fail in our responsibilities, the repercussions affect our citizens.’’ He said. 
He added: We don’t talk about building our nation merely because it’s a good thing. It should be part of our identity. This fight we have been involved in for the last 24 years must be sustained, otherwise who else will fight for us? President Kagame concluded: ‘ ‘Let us continue to do what is in our ability to develop our country further.’’
