Train staff to curb tax avoidance, URA urged Advertisement By Christine Kasemiire 
Kampala. 
Uganda Revenue Authority should strengthen its staff capacity if it is to curb tax avoidance, especially among multinationals, a tax expert has said. Speaking at a tax awareness meeting in Kampala at the weekend, Ms Rose Sebatindira, the founding partner at Ligomarc Advocates and a tax expert, said tax avoidance deprives countries of billions of shillings, which cripples economic growth. She revealed that URA had already embarked on a training by sending some of its staff to Paris, France to learn how to implement the 2011 transfer pricing laws. The project, conducted under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting programme, she said, comes at the back of a controversy in European countries over taxation policies regarding multinationals. “There is a project within the Organisation for Economic Development where developing countries [can be trained to] make sure there are no harmful practices carried out by multinationals. Transactions between multinationals [can] be investigated so that they do not avoid taxes,” she said.Tax avoidance among large companies has deprived African economies of huge sums of money. Sebatindira made the remark after elaborating on a controversy arising from Luxembourg’s taxation policy that negotiates policies on a company basis which is seen as discriminatory to the European Union.Many multinationals, according to Ms Sebatindira avoid taxes through transfer pricing, however, she said Uganda can curb this by implementing the 2011 regulations. advertisement
