As the traffic police is trying to re-brand after a period of perceived impunity by some members of the society, it is time the traffic department intervenes to control errant motorists, who perceive themselves to be more important on the road than other motorists. 
Uganda has many financial and non- financial bodies who come along with titles of Chief Executive Offices, Executive Directors , judges , ministers etc. Many of the drivers of these VIPs and other government officials feel the world owes them a living hence they force a right of way. Mayhem, panic and stress ensues on our roads whenever a VIP is in the vicinity. IGP Martins Okoth-Ochola promised to take stock of the number of VIPs with escorts. The public is waiting to see this done as many of the so-called VIPs are abusing other road users’ rights. Does an executive director of an authority have the right of way on our roads? 
There is a vehicle belonging to a statutory body and it is driven recklessly. This speeding vehicle cruises through all traffic queues from Kira Township , Najjera, Ntinda and Nagulu at terrific speed. It is always driven on road shoulders hence putting the life of other pedestrians at risk. The traffic officers that man the Kira-Najjera-Ntinda road stretch appear to reluctant to caution the driver of this vehicle. 
The traffic police should act on such drivers to show them that they are not above the law. Percy Mulamba
