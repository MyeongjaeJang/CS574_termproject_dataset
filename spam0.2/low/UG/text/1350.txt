Guards held over Shs50m, car theft from car bond Advertisement By JOSEPH KATO 
KAMPALA- Two private security guards who allegedly connived with thieves to steal Shs50 million and a second hand vehicle from a car bond in Kampala, on Wednesday, have been arrested. 
Kampala Metropolitan Police spokesperson, Mr Luke Owoyesigyire, said the thieves attacked Aida Car Bond on Lugogo Bypass and used chloroform to sedate the security guards employed by Triple Booth Security, in order to execute their mission. 
Police said two guards were on Thursday morning found unconscious and were taken to hospital but under the watch of police detectives since they are now regarded as prime witnesses. 
“We took the two guards who were found unconscious to Mulago Hospital but their colleague could not be seen. The two have now gained consciousness and have told us that they were attacked late in the night,” Mr Owoyesigyire said. 
Mr Owoyesigyire declined to give details of the stolen car because such information could alert the suspects. 
“The third guard is not yet seen and we are trying to establish his whereabouts. I cannot confirm or conclude that it was connivance or whether he is being held by the attackers or not. We are doing whatever is possible to find his whereabouts,” Mr Owoyesigyire said. 
Police said the two guards will be interrogated to know what transpired and possibly help in tracing their colleague who could have masterminded the robbery. 
Last year, a security guard connived with thugs to rob merchandise and money from a computer firm at Kisekka Market Lane. They executed their mission after killing a female guard. jkato@ug.nationmedia.com
