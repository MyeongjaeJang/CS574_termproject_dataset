KAMPALA. 
The police have issued an advisory to the public to avoid routine itinerary and challenge any arrest to avoid being kidnapped. Police spokesperson Emilian Kayima urged the public to demand to see an arrest warrant from police officers carrying out an arrest. Mr Kayima said whoever is arrested has a right to be told who is arresting them, why they are being arrested and where they are being taken. He also advised anybody who may find themselves being kidnapped in a public place not to allow to be taken away quietly but raise an alarm to alert onlookers. He said when any arresting officers fails to identify themselves, the public has a right to arrest and hand them over to the police. But Mr Kayima cautioned victims who are taken by surprise by the kidnappers that they are safer keeping quiet and not raising any alarm. “Staying cool will help you identify the suspects and communicate with relatives for help. People should learn using speed dials on their handsets so that in such situations they can ring their relatives to know what was happening,” Mr Kayima said. He said kidnappers are not complete strangers to their victims, with their motive for kidnap ranging from murder, ransom, and forceful transfer of property. Mr Kayima noted that over time, the police have also witnessed some people kidnapping themselves to exit a relationship and to win an election. The police also said some other people fake own kidnap to explain away fraudulent transactions or how they have lost money. Mr Kayima said hiking free lifts have also made people vulnerable to kidnaps. Mr Kayima advised people to report immediately a missing person and not wait for 24 hours before they act. advertisement
