Singer Big Eye has said that Bryan White helps him to work hard and get paid to stay away from stealing. He was hitting back at critics who have constantly blamed him for being part of the Bryan White Foundation. 
The Big Music Entertainment CEO, Big Eye a.k.a Ibrahim Mayanja, is irritated by music fans, and critics who keep blaming him for supporting Bryan White and taking part in the daily activities of the Bryan White Foundation. Many fans have always cursed artistes who belong to the foundation saying their major aim in the foundation is not to help communities but rather to exploit money from the rich man Bryan White. Artistes like Weasel, King Micheal, Jose Chameleone, among others have in the past been blamed for the same thing. 

Unlike other artistes who choose to ignore the criticism, Big Eye has vowed not to keep quiet and he has some questions for the critics as well. He took it to social media to post a few photos of himself with bundles of money that was paid to him for working with the Bryan White Foundation. In the caption, he wrote; 
“Hi ma fans, I made this brand Big Eye and Big Music Entertainment to help me earn income so that I can manage to pay my bills and take care of other responsibilities. It cost me a lot. So now I wonder why someone has to blame me for working with the Bryan White Foundation when am earning. Do you want me to stop earning from what I worked hard for and I start stealing? Really?” 

No Sir! We do not want you to steal. Lol! Like this:
