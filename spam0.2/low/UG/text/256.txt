Uganda National Roads Authority enforcement team has demolished structures at Kalerwe Bivamuntuuyo Market to pave way for expansion of Kampala northern bypass. In 2013 government of Uganda acquired grant of 67 million Euros (Shs246b) from European Union to facilitate the expansion of the 17.5 Kilometer road to a dual carriage removing roundabouts and replacing them with flyovers and traffic lights at various areas of Namboole and Kalerwe, Busega, Ntinda, Kisaasi and Namungoona/Lubigi, widening of road junctions at Ssentema. Speaking to this website, communications manager of UNRA Allan Ssempebwa said, the construction company allocated Shs 19 billion compensation to all land owners where the project is expected to go through. “The during the demolition process, all the affected parties had been fully engaged, compensated and informed about the exercise.” He said in an interview with Eagle Online. Upon completion, Northern Bypass will be help in the reduction of traffic congestion in the city since heavy tracks trekking to Eastern Uganda; Congo Burundi will be using that route. “Kampala is mainly congested due to the narrow roads, and absence of flyovers, UNRA is yet to introduce flyovers on Kampala road.” The first phase of Kampala Northern Bypass was constructed by Salini Construction Company in 2004 at an estimated budget of Shs87 billion, however the project ended up costing over Shs 100billion and three years behind schedule. Currently the expansion of the bypass was awarded to Portuguese Company, Mota Engil however the project is behind schedule to due to the delayed process of acquiring land. It is this year that the project expected to be executed. SHARE
