Is Miguna just a passing cloud or a man to watch? Advertisement By Fitzwanaga Dalla 
A new broom is sweeping across Kenya. He is confident and brash in the style of Jose Mourinhio way back in 2004 when he unveiled himself as the special one as Chelsea coach. 
He pulls no punches and has been known to attack his former paymaster Raila Odinga as well as the powers that be without fear or favour. His name is Mr Joshua Miguna Miguna, a barrister. 
His CV reads like a mini-Mandela or like former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe - that is the usual advocation against dictatorship, imprisonment and a life in exile. Like Mr Mugabe, he has a degree and an impeccable command of the English language. 
His stock value rose exponentially this past week due to government’s gross mishandling of his attempt to return to the country from Canada where he holds dual citizenship. The unfolding drama looked like a re-enactment of the Terminal starring Tom Hanks. It wasn’t quite what he might have wanted. 
He was bundled and put on a plane to Dubai. As the debate on whether he renounced his citizenship continues, the question for Kenya is two-fold: 
Are we seeing a new broom of political leaders, brash and unconnected to the old, who in one form or another, have worked for the old and are now seen as opportunists or is Mr Miguna just a passing cloud? 
Social media is abuzz with criticism as to how Mr Raila failed to bail out Mr Miguna or criticise the heavy handed tactics of the government on Mr Miguna . Fitzwanaga Dalla,
