Sevilla 1 Barcelona 2 
Primera Liga teams are running out of games to end Barca’s unbeaten record. Vincenzo Montella’s Sevilla are among a handful of sides capable of giving La Blaugrana serious food for thought. All the same, I expect Barcelona to maintain their eleven point cushion. 
Las Palmas 1 Real Madrid 2 
Relegation-threatened Las Palmas surprisingly held Barca’s to a one-all tie. I therefore think they will give Real a good run for their money. Nevertheless, without any Champions League distraction, the red-hot Cristiano Ronaldo will have too much for them.

ENGLISH PREMIERSHIP 
Chelsea 2 Tottenham 1 
It is all or nothing for Antonio Conte’s champions Chelsea as they attempt to best London rivals Tottenham Hotspur and pile the pressure in the race for Uefa Champions League places. Chelsea’s strong head-to-head record against Tottenham Hotspur and Harry Kane’s absence tips the balance in Chelsea’s favour in this English Premier League encounter. 
Everton 1 Man City 2 
Even though Everton have traditionally troubled Manchester City in this fixture, Sam Allardyce’s version hasn’t yet gelled into a unit strong enough to challenge champion elects Manchester City. Watch out for German-born pair Leroy Sane and Cenk Tosun.
