The energy from an opening day defeat to New Zealand is still in the sinews of She Cranes players.The national netball team put on a competitive display in going down to their highly fancied opponents on Thursday and the players feel someone must pay along the way at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast.“Malawi will fall,” Goal Shooter Peace Proscovia said. “In fact it is just as well that they are our next opponents because they are the sort of opponents we needed after losing to New Zealand.”The She Cranes, who won hearts of the neutrals by pushing New Zealand to the wire, were also undone by some inadvertent errors such as Lillian Ajiyo’s boob tube which evidently discomforted during the game.She could be seen adjusting it from time to time but team manager Jocelyn Ucanda says the issue has been addressed.“We fixed it right away and can ascertain that no such problem will surface again,” she told SCORE. Although Malawi are one of Africa’s top ranked teams, the She Cranes can be excused for going into the tie with self-belief.Proscovia shot a somewhat modest 88% against New Zealand missing 5 of her 42 shots, a percentage Goal Attack Rachael Nanyonga also matched but from 16 shots.When Proscovia is at her impeccable best, few teams on the continent can live up to Uganda and coach Imedla Nyongesa will be hoping her best player turns in an A-game.There will be no restimg time after tonight with England up next tomorrow at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre.
