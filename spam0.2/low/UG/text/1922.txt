What should one do about ignored employee issues? Moses Ssesanga Advertisement By Moses Ssesanga 
What should you do when management never gives solutions to recurrent problems? You have the same problems year after year, send complaints in meeting after meeting but no solution is given. What should I do? Fiona 
Dear Fiona,It’s fortunate that you haven’t provided examples of what you consider to be the ‘recurrent problems’ in the organisation you are referring to. However, the role of the management team in any business is multifaceted. The team has to provide solutions to identified problems or challenges the organisation may be facing, make money for the owners (shareholders) while taking care of the other stakeholders’ interests in the entity. These stakeholders include the employees, government, the communities where the business operates.If there are recurrent problems affecting the business as you indicate, and there are no solutions provided to address them, then the management team would be failing in one of its cardinal roles.You should however realise that what you may consider to be perennial problems in the organisation you are referring to, may not actually be among the immediate priorities that management team has decided to find solutions for, or provide the kind of solutions you would like to see.However I can recommend a proven approach you can use to ensure a listening ear by any management team. An employee always gets attention when they approach their boss or the head of the business with innovative and cost-effective solutions to the challenges they have identified.
