Charles Lukwago’s suspension for KCCA’s opening Caf Champions League opening group game has thrust his understudies Jamil Malyamungu and Thomas Ikara into the limelight.On a day when Lukwago was given a rare day off, Malyamungu showed what he can do if given chance by playing a starring role as KCCA edged Soana to the Stanbic Uganda Cup quarter finals.The goalkeeper saved two postmatch penalty kicks before scoring the winner as KCCA progressed 4-3 on penalties after a 2-2 draw in regulation time.“I feel happy but hope to perform much better in the subsequent games,” Malyamungu said of his performance at the Kavumba Recreation ground yesterday. He was largely not at fault for the goals his side conceded with Steven Ategeka tapping in an Issa Mubiru left wing cross at the far post before slack marking gifted the striker a late equalizer. In a lacklustre display following their continental exploits and manager Mike Mutebi’s absence, Patrick Kaddu headed the cup holders level off another Mustafa Kizza delivery.Substitute Paul Mucureezi then looked to have given KCCA the win following good combination with Muhammad Shaban on 75 minutes.Malyamungu then saved from Simon Okwi and Pate Wanok to ensure victory despite Mucureezi’s miss.Third tier KJT meanwhile provided the shock of the round by ejecting Bul 2-1 at Villa Park.Former champions and Azam Uganda Premier League leaders SC Villa are meanwhile in action today against promotion-chasing Big League side Ndejje at Wankulukulu. advertisement
