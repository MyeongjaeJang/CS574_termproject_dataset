KAMPALA- Allan Okello’s performance at the Startimes Stadium yesterday was perhaps not as breathtaking as his debut hattrick against Onduparaka just over a year ago. 
Yet at the end of the 2018 Azam Uganda Premier League (AUPL) season, his act yesterday could prove even more significant as KCCA chase a third straight domestic league crown. 
The forward scored a late double against 10-man UPDF to hand KCCA a deserved 2-0 win over the relegation battling army side. “Those that are up are the ones who should be looking over their shoulders with worry,” KCCA manager Mike Mutebi said of the result that moved them within three points of leaders SC Villa. 
KCCA moved into second position on 43 points from 21 games, three less than the leaders.KCCA dominated the game from start to finish but had been unable to breakdown a spirited UPDF resistance led by goalkeeper Bashir Ssekajja who is on loan from the Lugogo side. The youthful custodian saved thrice from Patrick Kaddu in the opening half, first beating away the striker’s effort from a tight angle before stopping a header directed straight at him. 
He then parried another hard shot as KCCA ended the first half strongly. Changes that brought in Paul Mucureezi, Solomon Okwalinga and Hassan Musana appeared to change little even after UPDF midfielder Sulaiman Majanjalo was sent off for two needless fouls.Okello then took charge collecting a ball from Musana, creating space and shooting low inside Ssekajja’s left hand goal post on 81 minutes. 
He then made sure of the result six minutes later with another low drive this time off his right foot after a poor clearance from Julius Kasambira.
