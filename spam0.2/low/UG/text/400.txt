The High Court in Masindi has dismissed a case in which former Bunyoro Kingdom prime minister, Mr Norman Lukumu, sued his predecessor, Mr Andrew Byakutaaga for illegally occupying his office. 
Mr Lukumu told court that Mr Byakutaga had forcefully taken over his office. 
Court presided over by the acting Registrar of High Court, Mr Simon Kintu on Thursday dismissed the case because the applicant did not present sufficient evidence to prove how Mr Byakutaaga was illegally appointed and not fit to serve as Bunyoro’s prime minister. 
Mr Lukumu had argued that he never received a termination letter from the King of Bunyoro Solomon Gafabusa Iguru I apart from radio announcements. 
“I was sick in Mulago Hospital and heard announcements and news on radio stations and some phone calls from people in Masindi that I had been sacked by the king,” Mr Lukumu said. 
Mr Lukumu said when he went home, the Bunyoro king denied having sacked him and told him to continue serving.However, Mr Mohamad Mbabazi who represented Mr Byakutaaga presented an affidavit by the Omukama of Bunyoro Kingdom, challenging Mr Lukumu’s argument that he cleared him to continue serving. 
This prompted Mr Andrew Sebugwayo, Mr Lukumu’s lawyer to leave court before the ruling, after accusing the registrar of being biased.“We are going to seek an appropriate redress because the judge is biased,” he said. 
He said: “I haven’t been served with the Omukama’s affidavit and I have no time to assess the evidence because they are just serving me in the court room while the judge is just protecting them [defendants],” Mr Sebugwawo said outside court. 
Mr Byakutaaga who was appointed on January 16 said after the ruling that he will ensure that the kingdom gets a constitution to end conflicts in the palace.
