KAMPALA. For over a decade leading to 2015, Green Hill Academy did not partake in any swimming activities. 
It was partly because there was no national secondary schools gala at the time while the primary schools’ one had taken a seven years’ sabbatical.The only competition where schools had a chance to participate was the then Excel Independence Gala but then it also featured better swimmers from clubs and international schools. 
However, since Green Hill returned to the scene alongside the USF National Secondary Schools Gala and the Midland National Primary Schools Gala, they have been a force like no other. 
On Saturday at their own home pool, the Kibuli-based school shook off competition from Seeta Green (1,639 points) and their sister school Seeta High School – Main Campus (1,537) to win a fourth straight secondary schools title. That is just two weeks after a third primary schools triumph at the same venue. 
The Seeta schools topped girls’ and boys’ categories respectively but while Main finished third among the girls (591) and Green fifth (531) in the boys, Green Hill balanced it out as runners-up in each category hence a combined top score of 1,892. 
Youngster Daudi Ochieng, 13, led from the front as he amassed 160 of the total points that Green Hill had at the DStv sponsored event.Ochieng, swimming in the 12-13 boys’ category, won all his races bar the 100m breast but Green Hill also had brilliant performances from usual suspects Esther Atto, 12, and Namanya Ampaire, 14 who managed 148 and 132 points respectively. 
Mariam Tendo also topped the 16 and over girls with 158 points while Taibah’s Jeremy Katende topped the boys with 142. Seeta Green’s Mary Nassuuna also attempted to come in the way of Green Hill’s dominance as she topped the 14-15 year old girls with 122 points.
