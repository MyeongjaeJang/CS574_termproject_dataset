March 21, 2018 FAILED TO PAY DEBT? Brian Kirumira aka Bryan White 
Upcoming musician Simon Mukasa aka Lucky Costa has threatened to drag socialite Brian Kirumira aka Bryan White and DJ Michael to court for failing to pay for his services. 
In a notice with an intention to sue, Mukasa through Muwada and Company Advocates indicates that he was hired by the duo to perform at their function but that they failed to pay for his services as earlier agreed. The artiste now wants the self-styled millionaire to pay him Shs20 million as compensation or the matter be taken to court. 
‘On or around 9 February, 2018, our client and you (Brian Kirumira alias White) at Front Page Zaana Entebbe met and agreed to purchase the copyright of his publication song titled Heroe-Basiima Bagenzi and his physical performance of the same song. It was agreed that you Kirumira Brian aka Bryan White was to pay Shs10, 000,000 for the song, and in addition you made several other promises like buying him land and constructing him a house as a gesture of application,’ reads part of the notice by Muwada and Co. to Brian White and DJ Michael. 
The notice adds: ‘However, efforts to secure payment of the agreed Shs10, 000,000 are all in vain “yet our client’s song has been played on several Bryan White Foundation functions and at some you required and secured physical performance of the song by our client”. 
‘You have engaged our client to perform the same song on various Bryan White programs including performances at Auto Spa, Munyonyo and Kakyeeka stadium, Mbarara at the launch of the Bryan White Foundation,’ the law firm further charges. 
‘Pay us Sh20m as compensation in a lieu of image damage/slander caused on our client’s name by media’, the lawyers tersely assert.
