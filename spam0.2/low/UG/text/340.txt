The publication developed by UIA in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme is dubbed: ‘Compendium of Investment and Business Opportunities Volume 2’. It is under the Diaspora Resource Mobilization and Utilization Project. 
The book presents information on the economy and key sectors that present investment business opportunities in agriculture, trade, mining, social, health, tourism, infrastructure, education, works and transport, oil and gas and forestry. 
The book presents business ideas that have been identified as most responsive to the priorities in the various sectors, presented as one page summaries to give an insight of the feasibility of their implementation. The booklet mentions piggery as a viable business in Uganda 
The booklet guides investors on over 200 business start-ups including hatchery, piggery, brick-making, restaurants, mobile food vending, leather purses, bolts and nuts, paint and manufacturing, cheese making, and juice extraction among several others. 
The book also shows the scale of investment, production or output volumes, values and profitability as key information in these ideas, believed to be the critical data necessary for making an investment business decision.
