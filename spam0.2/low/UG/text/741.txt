Does Jinja East by-election offer lessons to politicians? Advertisement By Denis Wembi 
It’s nearly a fortnight since Mr Paul Mwiru won the Jinja East Municipality by-election. It can be said the by-election results might not have a bearing in 2021 elections. 
The fact is that every election has its own dynamics and constituency elections do not impact on other elections. At the same time, only a political novice would assume this by-election has no relevance for 2021. 
Never before had the Opposition exhibited great sense of unity like they did in regard to the Jinja East by-election. 
Nearly all Opposition heavy weights descended on Jinja for two days and the result is that they pulled off great victory for Mr Mwiru. The by-election sent the NRM party bigwigs sinking, not thinking. I have a firm belief that the Opposition is yet to launch a firm move that will encase the NRM into a dark cage. 
Even with all the schemes directed against them by the NRM party, the united Opposition was still able to overcome these hurdles to attain victory. There are three social sins that some ofthe contestants against Mr Mwiru forgot. They are having pleasure without conscience; politics without principles; and knowledge without character. Mr Mwiru avoided these and won. 
Besides, the shameless remarks by the NRM party leader “...a sick and sleepy NRM MP is far better than an active Opposition MP...” was absurd. The 2021 elections will provide a perfect platform for voters to target and penalise sleepy politicians. Denis Wembi ,
