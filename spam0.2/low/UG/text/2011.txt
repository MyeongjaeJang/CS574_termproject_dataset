World Animal Protection Condemns Killing of 11 Lions in Uganda   
World Animal Protection strongly condemns the killing of 11 lions in Hamukungu in Uganda. This comes at a time when lion’s population is on a steep decline with about 90 lions left in this park. 
Edith Kabesiime , Wildlife Campaigns Manager says, “The death of a whole pride of 11 lions in Hamukungu at Queen Elizabeth National Park in Western Uganda, and similar deaths across Africa highlight how urgent it is to do all we can to prevent such needless decimation of the continent’s remaining big cats. - Advertisement - 
Human-lion conflict should be treated as an urgency and serious measures taken to stamp out this tit-for-tat mentality and practice. Lion poisoning has far-reaching effects. It is more tragic that non-target species especially scavenger birds, hyenas and other mammals get killed inadvertently.”
