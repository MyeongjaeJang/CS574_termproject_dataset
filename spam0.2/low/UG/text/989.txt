2018-03-22 - Champions League: KCCA draw giants Al Ahly, Esperance 
However, KCCA return to continental football at the tail-end of the league season. Therefore, Mutebi expects no excuses from his charges, beginning with Kirinya Jinja SS this Friday in the league. This will be a crucial game that kick-starts a flurry of away games expected to determine KCCA’s fate. 
After Kirinya, the champions host Mbarara and UPDF but thereafter travel to Onduparaka, Maroons, Vipers and Express. It is likely the rescheduled Bright Stars game at Mwererwe, will be fitted in somewhere. 
As Mutebi rallies his charges, there should be a big turnaround in his side’s away form because KCCA’s last win on the road in the league was against Soana last November. They have only two away wins in seven matches. 
Mutebi said winning the league has never been a pushover: “And because we are the champions, every team prepares hard to stop us,” Mutebi said. 
Kirinya have won four and drawn one of their last five games. Last season, Kirinya held KCCA to a one-all draw at Bugembe.
