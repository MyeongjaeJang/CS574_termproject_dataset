Former Bubulo West legislator Tony Kipoi Nsubuga has appeared before General Court Martial (GCM) on treason charges, alongside five UPDF soldiers: Sgt. Yunus Lemeriga, Sgt. Adams Mawa, Sgt. Albino Okenge, Cpl Rogers Mwiru, and Private Ddodola Ijosiga. 
Prosecution avers that between November 2012 and December 2013, while in various districts of Masaka, Jinja, Kampala Uganda, Kipoi convened meetings to recruit soldiers with the intention of overthrowing government. 
But appearing before the GCM chaired by Lt Gen Andrew Guti today, the accused denied all charges after which Kipoi was remanded to Luzira prison while his co-accused were returned to Makindye military barracks till April 24, 2018. 
Kipoi was arrested in Botswana in February alongside a one Robert Kitali and both were extradited to Uganda in March after reportedly extorting money by posing as a witch doctors. Both were then handed over to military police before Kipoi was sent on remand to Luzira prison by Nakawa Grade One magistrate Jameson Karemani. 
In 2013, Kipoi was allegedly arrested in Congo and charged with treason however he refuted the claims, saying he had fled the country because of bad governance under President Yoweri Museveni. 
In the same year, he lost his Parliamentary seat upon missing sixteen consecutive sittings, a ground that provides for someone to be expelled from Parliament. 
Kipoi has since reportedly been oscillating between the DRC and South Africa, but was wanted by the Ugandan authorities to answer the charges of treason.
