I am a concerned citizen who often travels across the East African Community countries, but I have failed to see the benefits of the community to the people. 
Recently, we travelled to Kenya to watch 2018 Safari Rally in which Uganda sent two representatives, Mr Jas Mangat and Duncan Mubiru. However, the way Ugandans were treated was like they were from another planet. 
From the boarder to all the rally points, Kenyan traffic police stopped all Uganda registered vehicles and would not let any of them to leave unless you gave them some money. These traffic officers asked between KShs500 and KShs2,000. Personally, after I was stopped seven times, I decided to protest on my eighth arrest. 
But because of the hustle of complaining I was arrested and taken to their court where I was fined KShs15,000 (about Shs525,000). 
At one road block where I produced all the documents they asked for, one officer told me that my vehicle was dirty. This could have been true because I drove in rain all the way from Jinja to Nairobi. 
What was strange is that when they took me to court, they changed the statement and said I did not have a safety reflector triangle. I am asking EALA MPs, minister for East African Affairs and embassies to look through this matter otherwise we are losing hope in EAC.Isaac Keith Ssali,
