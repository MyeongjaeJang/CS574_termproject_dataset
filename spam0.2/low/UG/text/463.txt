Govt accuses teachers of deviating from curriculum Advertisement By PATIENCE AHIMBISIBWE 
Kampala. 
The government has accused teachers of being lazy and deviating from teaching the approved curriculum which has continued to affect the expected learning outcomes.“Our people are not implementing the curriculum that has been approved. They are trying to teach their own things because when they try to teach good English they think that is when that child has learnt and that is where we are getting it wrong,” Ms Grace Baguma, National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC) executive director, said yesterday.Her statement was complimented by Mr Robinson Nsumba-Lyazi, the director Basic Education at a media briefing in Kyambogo ahead of an international curriculum conference that NCDC will host in May. According to Mr Nsumba-Lyazi, many schools rush to complete the syllabus within a short time without ensuring that the students understand the concepts.He said this has culminated into constant testing of the learners, teaching late into the night without giving time to the students to practice. He ordered schools to stop.“Those curriculum deviations are there because of laziness. The teachers want to finish the syllabus in very short time and leave critical areas they must go through to make sure the teaching and learning is taking place. Those are anomalies. We are now very strict on head teachers. They must make sure the teachers have lesson plans and schemes of work and ensure that learning is taking place,” Mr Nsumba-Lyazi said.Ms Baguma added that with the rising population, many countries are battling with curriculum reforms and their planned symposium under the African Curriculum Organisation is expected to address some of the 21st Century challenges the continent is facing.They will also focus on how to develop curriculum materials, look at new teaching methods, assessment and ensure they minimise inconsistence in curriculum delivery and maintain standards which are competitive on the global village.Ms Baguma further added that following the rollout of the thematic curriculum more than 10 years ago, Uganda National Examinations Board (Uneb) has stopped examining learners on multiple choice questions because it was discovered that they encourage cram work.Uneb has, however, continued to report cases of cram work, cheating and failure by students to understand concepts during the release of national examination results.On their part, the teachers said the Ministry of Education and NCDC have to blame for the wrongs that are happening in the education sector. advertisement
