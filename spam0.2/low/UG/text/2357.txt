DP accuses government of sabotaging their unity effort Mr Mao Advertisement By SHABIBAH NAKIRIGYA 
KAMPALA- The Opposition Democratic Party have expressed frustration over the failure by their youth wing Uganda Young Democrats (UYD) to secure a venue for their forthcoming alumni assembly. 
Addressing journalists during the party’s weekly press conference in Kampala on Tuesday, the party’s Deputy Spokesperson, Mr Alex Mufumbira said the failure to get the venue has affected their move to "unite party members." 
“The assembly has been postponed from May 2 to May 23 because it has been hard to find the venue to hold that historical meeting,” Mr Mufumbira said. 
He said the party is now considering hosting the meeting at the main ground of Makerere University. 
“The assembly is aiming to have a formidable force by 2021 to oust the current dictatorship,” Mr Mufumbira said. 
He said they have international partners who are willing to support the youth wing’s effort towards unity and cohesion. 
Mr Mufumbira warned the government not to intervene in the historical assembly that is aimed at sowing the seeds of equality, democracy and tranquillity in the country. 
Early this month UYD alumni held a meeting at Speke Hotel in Kampala to announce their new strategy. 
DP President Mr Norbert Mao also an alumni of UYD alleged that government agents went to the Uganda Manufacturers Association in Lugogo and threatened them not to host their meeting in the conference hall yet they had received the invoice to pay for the venue. 
He said when they tried Nsambya Sharing Hall and Pope Paul Memorial Community Centre in Ndeeba, they received similar treatment. 
At the briefing, DP rejected the government's proposal to increase taxes in the 2018 /2019 Financial Year. 
“We shall officially state our position and give a statement to the chief whip of DP about our stand not to increase the current tax caps,” Mr Mufumbira said. snakirigya@ug.nationmedia.com
