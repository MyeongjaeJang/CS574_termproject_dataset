KAMPALA- President Museveni has sent home the director for Citizenship and Immigration, Mr Godfrey Sasaga and the Commissioner for Immigrations Commissioner, Mr Anthony Namara. 
“I heard about it; they are interdicted, yes,” Mr Mario Obiga Kania, the State minister for Internal Affairs, say by telephone from India. 
Another highly-placed government official says senior detectives at the Criminal Investigations Directorate have been assigned to investigate the two top Immigration officials. 
We were unable to immediately establish the reasons for their suspension. The President’s letter interdicting Mr Sasaga and Mr Namara was sent to the Internal Affairs minister on Wednesday evening, according to an official familiar with the matter. 
The Directorate of Citizenship and Immigrations is under the Ministry of Internal Affairs and is responsible for “managing migrations to and from Uganda”. 
Its mandate, according to information on its website, include facilitating “legal and orderly movement of persons to and from Uganda; process, verify and grant Uganda citizenship; and, regulate the issuance of national passports and other travel documents”. 
Through its work, the directorate also provides “conducive immigration environment for foreign investment in Uganda while enforcing national and regional immigration laws for the security and development of Uganda”. tbutagira@ug.nationmedia.com
