Welcome to life in a glass bottle," Katureebe welcomed the new judges.Adding: "People expect nothing of you but high integrity and not your knowledge of the law. So, as you come to the Judiciary, always remember the oath of allegiance but more importantly the judicial oath that you have just taken".The Chief Justice also cautioned the new judges that Ugandans will write about them if they act contrary to their judicial oath. advertisement
