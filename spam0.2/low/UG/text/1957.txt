Public misled on Crane Bank sale, says Mutebile BoU Governor Emmanuel Tumusiime Mutebile Advertisement By Solomon Arinaitwe 
Kampala. 
As the controversial sale of Crane Bank to dfcu continues to ruffle senior officials at Bank of Uganda (BoU), fresh defences have emerged from Governor Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile and his Deputy Louis Kasekende, clearing the air over why they sanctioned the disputed deal.Mr Mutebile and Mr Kasekende addressed separate dinners of senior executives on April 6 in Kampala, specifically tackling the fallout from the 2016 sale of Crane Bank.Governor Mutebile said criticism of the Central Bank over the sale was “unfair and very ill informed”.“I want to refute in the strongest terms possible that the “sale” of Crane Bank to dfcu was in some ways suspicious or scandalous. Infact, Crane Bank was not sold to dfcu. A sale was not possible,” Mr Mutebile told a closed dinner, according to leaked copies of his speech.Mr Mutebile acknowledged that BoU “should be subject to public scrutiny and debate” but called for “professional responsibility” from critics of the Central Bank.The Governor said the public is being “misled” regarding BoU’s sale of Crane Bank.Mr Mutebile insisted the Central Bank had intervened in four banks in the last six years and that each of the interventions was in line “with the procedures laid down in the Financial Institutions Act”.Separately, Mr Kasekende told an anniversary dinner that the insolvency of Crane Bank had not been caused “by problems in the wider economy”, but “mismanagement”. 
Contention “It has been alleged that Crane Bank was sold by BoU for a fraction of the value of its assets, ignoring the fact that the bank has liabilities such as deposits, as well as assets. When Crane Bank was dissolved by BoU, the value of assets was much less than the value of its liabilities,” he said.The Central Bank has been in the eye of the storm since December 2016 when it closed Crane Bank, one of the largest commercial banks in the country, and later sold it to dfcu. Former Crane Bank owner Sudhir Ruparelia is now challenging the sale before the High Court.Recently, the Inspector General of Government, Ms Irene Mulyagonja, was locked in a public war-of-words with Mr Mutebile over contentious staff reshuffles the Governor effected at the bank in February.However, President Museveni summoned the duo to State House Entebbe and ordered them to stop publicly squabbling, warning that their fights can potentially scare away investors. advertisement
