Are crime preventers relevant in Uganda? Advertisement By Caroline Zawedde 
It beats my understanding if recent media stories to the effect that crime preventers are demanding their salaries from former IGP Kale Kayihura. 
In the first place, what was their role in society? Are they part of police or not? Different murders, raids and kidnaps have rocked the country and no crime preventer have come out to explain, arrest or report the culprits. 
The existence of crime preventers waters down police relevance. Otherwise, we will begin to ask, what is the role of police in a country? Was Gen Kayihura creating his own police in the name of crime preventers? 
The country’s resources have been misused by officials in government. These people under the umbrella of “crime preventers” should style up, get their boots on and go for job hunting and work. These so-called crime preventers have done more harm than good in the country. They are a group of unemployed and non-visionary Ugandans. 
Everyone - you and I, should be a crime preventer. Our role as citizens of this nation should include keeping law and order. There are still more weevils in police. More changes in the Force are still required to make it work better for the country and not individuals. Caroline Zawedde,
