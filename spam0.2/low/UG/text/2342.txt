For large periods, the clash between Onduparaka and KCCA looked to have been decided by Muhammad Shaban.A player with Onduparaka roots but who is now leading the KCCA title charge after his acrimonious departure at the start of the season.The former Onduparaka captain showed early intent, twice shooting wide before getting the game’s opener in typical style.
