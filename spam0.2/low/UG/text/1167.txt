Zambia expels Cuban envoy for endorsing opposition party   
Zambia has served expulsion notice to Cuban ambassador to the country Nelson Pages Vilas for publicly backing a new opposition outfit.“The government has expelled Cuban Ambassador to Zambia for conduct that is likely to jeopardise the bilateral relations between Zambia and Cuba,” president’s spokesman Amos Chanda told journalists on Sunday. 
He said the government has since directed the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to write to the Cuban government to recall their ambassador over “a breach of the diplomatic guidelines”. Mr Chanda added that diplomats are not allowed to engage in partisan politics in the country while there is a sitting government. - Advertisement -
