Court awards Shs15m to university students Advertisement By Robert Muhereza 
Kabale- The High Court in Kabale has awarded Shs15m as general damages to three former students of Bishop Barham University College, who sued the institution. 
On May 2012, Mr Elias Tumusingize, Mr Francis Byamugisha and Mr Alon Abaasa filed a case against Bishop Barham University College and Uganda Christian University demanding general damages for misrepresentation. 
They also demanded compensation for wasted fees and time. They claim that they were in 2005/6 admitted at Bishop Barham University College, an affiliate college of Uganda Christian University, to study a grade three teacher course, which they completed in 2008. However, when they applied for teaching posts, their applications were dishonoured on grounds that their certificates were not recognised by the Education ministry because the awarding institution was not approved to issue them. 
Kabale High Court presided over by Justice Moses Kazibwe Kawumi on Tuesday warded Shs5m for general damages to each plaintiff.
