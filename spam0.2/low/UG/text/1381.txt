Eddy Kenzo is in history books for having been the first Ugandan artiste to win a BET Award. 
And going by his latest action, he makes it clear that this is a legacy he is not ready to let go just like that. 
The ‘Sitya Loss’ hit maker has taken his award to the Uganda Museum for future viewing by the generations to come. 
“I have decided to put my BET AWARD, Afrima Best Male 2017 and KUNDE BF 2015 awards in the museum such that young people having a dream to become great musicians can look at them and be motivated to work harder and win even bigger ones, parents should bring their children and let them see these great honors for our country,” he noted as he handed over the awards Thursday. 
He further added that he will hand over even his recently won Nickelodeon award as soon as it arrives in the country. 
“I want to once again congratulate all Ugandans for winning this great award, Nickelodeon is a big award and let this award bring us together to work for our entertainment industry. I thank all people that voted but more so I want to thank my big family “Airtel Uganda”, you have been there for me and you will always be my real family. On this note therefore I want to challenge the Government and private companies, to start investing in talent most especially our great music industry, it is growing and becoming bigger day by day and this is something we can use to change lives of many young people out there.” 
He called for the need to acknowledge Ugandan musicians, “support them and develop facilities that can improve our music industry if we are to continue to compete on the international level”. 
“I acknowledge the acceptance by Uganda Museum to receive and keep these awards and I believe they are in safe hands of Government and they belong to the people of Uganda, i therefore encourage Uganda museum management that they allow people touch and feel them other than viewing them in the glass.” Post Views: 217
