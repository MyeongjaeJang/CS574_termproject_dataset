April 17, 2018 HAPPIER DAYS: Zari Hassan, hubby Diamond Platnumz and baby Nillian Dangote. 
Tanzania’s top music star Diamond Platnumz, husband to socialite Zari Hassan, has been arrested for posting pictures that authorities say breach cultural norms. 
Communications Minister Harrison Mwakwembe said in Parliament that the images of Platnumz project acts that go against a law that bans such acts. 
Last month, after President John Magufuli complained about obscenity in music videos, Tanzania’s authorities banned 13 songs by local artistes including Diamond. 
And recently, there was an Instagram post of Diamond playfully kissing an unidentified woman has been shared by several news sites, but it is unclear if these are the pictures that have got the artiste in trouble. 
Some people on social media are speculating that the musician was getting back at his former partner who left him. 
Meanwhile, police are also looking for Bongo artiste Nandi over similar claims.
