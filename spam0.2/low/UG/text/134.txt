The Rwanda section involves the rehabilitation and widening of the 208-kilometre Kagitumba-Kayonza-Rusumo Road. This will include two cross-border markets at Kagitumba (on the Rwanda/Uganda border) and at Rusumo (on the Rwanda/Tanzania border) and the rehabilitation of 10 milk collection centres and 10 water boreholes among other activities. In Rwanda, the project will also provide training for 1,600 women, 7 women associations and facilitate the planting of 41,500 trees. 
Rwandan Minister of Infrastructure James Musoni thanked the partners led by African Development Bank for the financial support to the project, stressing that the collaboration was evidence of the fruitful collaboration with the Bank and other partners. 
The project will ease access to markets, reduce the cost of doing business and increase the value of agricultural produce, create jobs for the local people and therefore increase household income, the Minister said. The African Development Bankâ€™s ongoing portfolio in Rwanda stands at an estimated US $892 million targeting transport, energy and water infrastructure and support to skills and private-sector development. - Advertisement -
