KAMPALA. 
New Deputy Inspector General of Police Brig Sabiiti Muzeeyi is now handing over office of Military Police commandant to Col William Bainomugisha. 
The function is being presided over by Maj Gen Peter Elweru the Commander of UPDF land forces. The function is underway at the Military Police barracks, Makindye a suburb of Kampala. 
Brig Muzeeyi was appointed Deputy IGP early this month to replace Okoth Ochola who was elevated to IGP when President Museveni fired Gen Kale Kayihura. At the time of this report, Brig Muzeyi was reading a handover report in a segment closed to the press. 
Deputy UPDF Spokesperson Lt col Deo Akiiki says, "the handover reports are classified and the information therein is not for public consumption". Later on the press will be re-invited to the room to cover the exchange of instruments of power before speeches in an open segment outside the room. advertisement
