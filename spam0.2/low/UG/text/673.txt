A teacher was on March 26 stabbed while a security guard sustained head injuries as they hunted for a student who had reportedly eloped with a pork seller in Namwendwa Village in Kamuli District. 
Joshua Waiswa, the disciplinary teacher and Paul Mwiru, a security guard at Nalango Senior Secondary School in Kamuli District, had gone to follow up on a senior three student identified as Margret Babirye who had been sent home for scholastic materials and fees on March 25 but ended up at the home of Gerald Kizito, a pork seller. 
Acting on a tip-off from fellow students, at around noon on Monday, Waiswa and Mwiru traced the student to Kizito’s house and upon knocking the door, Kizito surged forward with the machete he uses for chopping pork and stabbed Waiswa in the chest before hitting Mwiru on the head. 
Upon seeing their teacher in a pool of blood, the students pursued Kizito and beat him before Police arrived and rescued him.Waiswa was rushed to Al-shafa Hospital in Jinja before being referred to Nakasero Hospital in a critical condition while Kizito is being detained at Namwenda police station on attempted murder charges. 
Babirye told Daily Monitor, while in custody at Namwendwa police station, that she was connected to the pork seller by a friend who was expelled from school because of escaping from school without permission and that on that fateful day, she had visited Kizito for transport and the refund of her fees which they had spent during Valentine’s Day with a promise that he would repay when the pork business gets better. advertisement
