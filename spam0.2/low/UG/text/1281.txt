April 4, 2018 NOTU Secretary General, Christopher Peter Werike (R) and Usher Wilson Owere the NOTU 
National organization of trade union (NOTU) with seven affiliated public service labour unions has protested government’s move to enhance workers pays without consulting workers. Last year civil servants from various government institutions went on industrial actions demanding for among others pay raise and improvement in the their working conditions. However, this year a leaked document from the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development indicated that among others servant, primary teachers who currently earn Shs377, 781 will start earning Shs621, 320. According to a document released by Secretary General of NOTU Peter Christopher Werikhe inviting unions to an emergence meeting today, government is not only unlawful but unfair, to raise their salaries without negotiating with them. ‘’It is calculated at undermining workers and their trade unions as this must be resisted with all energies of various unions put together, Salaries must be negotiated for between government and trade union, therefore it is wrong for government to create an impression that it is doing workers and trade unions a favor.” The meeting with trade unions will is expected to mark the endorsement and rubber stamp government unfair proposals and not to negotiate and sign a collective bargaining agreement between the parties before implementation as is required by law. “Government approved and communicated to the accounting officers what it believes to be a salary enhancement and a letter of Permanent Secretary to the Treasurer and Ministry of Finance dated March 20, 2018 addressed to Accounting Officers for implementation of the same, It is no longer a secret, but abuse of the right of workers and their trade unions and cannot be accepted.” Reads part of the document. He noted that government should accept that their alleged salary increment is mere drafts proposals for negotiations between it and trade union. Seven affiliated public service labour unions include Uganda medical workers union (UMWU), Uganda nurse and midwives union (UNMU), Uganda national teachers union (UNATU) , National union of educational institutions (NUEI), Uganda local government workers union (ULGAWU), national union of government and allied workers (NUGAW) and Uganda government Post Views: 163
