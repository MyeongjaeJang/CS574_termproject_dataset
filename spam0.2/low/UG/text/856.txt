Education authorities in Kamuli District on Wednesday closed Nakakabala Primary School after suspected demons left 32 of its pupils hysterical. 
The District Inspector of Schools, Muzaham Chuka said for the past three days, pupils have been pelting their parents, teachers and members of the public with stones, screaming incomprehensibly and chasing everyone in the compound."We have closed the school until next Tuesday to avoid chaos and damage to property as authorities find a solution to the problem,‚Äù Mr Chuka said on Wednesday. 
He revealed that cases of demons invading schools had become rampant but earlier cases were dealt with through prayers from religious leaders and sometimes through cultural cleansing. 
Some residents allege the demons were brought by a highly placed Sheikh as a conduit for amassing wealth, recalling last year when an almost similar scenario engulfed Kabukye Muslim School. 
However, the Kamuli deputy District Health Officer, Moses Lyagoba, said this could point to something else and if tested, some of the girls could be pregnant. advertisement
