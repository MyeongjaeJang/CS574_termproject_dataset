Kampala , Uganda | JULIUS BUSINGE | Using right data tools and solutions in running businesses can lead up to over 50% growth of that entity in all segments, according to KPMG, an audit firm operating in Uganda and beyond. 
The firm is courting businesses to use advanced methods of managing data or information in a bid to achieve their targets. 
Speaking to The Independent in an interview, Brian D’Souza, the Head of Risk and Management Consulting at KPMG said they are having interesting solutions under what he technically referred to as ‘Data & Analytics’. Under this program, D’Souza said, businesses are able to capture the right information about their clients, do analysis with it to further understand their [clients] needs and serve them with ease. 
This, he said, would aid them to design strategies that would help their businesses become efficient, resilient, and effective and offer good quality service. 
“If you leverage data you will grow,” he said, “If you don’t use data properly you are not monetizing what you are doing.” 
D’Souza said that KPMG’s doors are open for businesses that are still struggling to determine what data to provide critical business outcomes. “The message from us is that you have got to adopt data in your organization …we brought concepts regarding privacy of data, governance of data but more importantly how this will affect growth, risk and costs within your businesses.” Share on:
