In many ways, the formation of an all-girl theatre group Afroman Spice in 2015 changed the way many looked at collaborations - then, many thought it was hard for girls to work together. 
But after the success that was Afroman Spice in June that year, we were later impressed with productions like What’s Your Secret and a reboot of Afroman Spice on Radio City and the Goethe Zentrum.The trio that has in the past taken on stages in Ivory Coast and Rwanda is this weekend making a comeback with an interesting take on a social topic - slay queens. 
Made up of poets Linda Nabasa and Rashida Namulondo, the group will be presenting a musical, poetry theatre production titled Slay Queens of Africa - but 
Kagisha replaces founding member Sandra Nankoma that left the group at the end of 2017 to concentrate on her music career.Directed by Rehema Nanfuka, Slay Queens of Africa is a satirical musical that aimed at shading a light on the lives of these social media magnets in Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya, Zimbabwe and other African countries. 
To avoid spoilers, the group has kept a lot under wraps though going by their social media updates, it will be a production that will talk about the slay queens people want to be and those they love to hate.Slay Queens of Africa starts showing at The Square this weekend on 14 and 15.
