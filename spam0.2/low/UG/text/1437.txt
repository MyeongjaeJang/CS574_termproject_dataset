April 6, 2018 Majid Batambuze 
Operative from the Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence have today morning arrested the Mayor of Jinja Municipality, Majid Batambuze. Batambuze is allegedly detained at CMI headquarters, Mbuya – Kampala on charges of fraud. Batambuze who is also the chairman the Urban Authorities Association of Uganda is alleged to have several cases of fraud according to sources at the Jinja Municipal Council.“Mayor Majid is being held (at CMI) over allegations of conning $160000 from an investor being brought by a governor of a certain district (not Jinja. He lied to the investor that he was selling to him land in Nalufenya village adjacent to the new bridge which land doesn’t belong to him,” revealed one source that requested not to be named for fear of his security “because the matter is involving names even bigger than that of Batambuze himself.” 
But another source said Majid, at the time he was the Resident District Commissioner for Budaka he sold some swamp land in Budaka to some European investors at 6 billion which land the buyers never got because the seller didn’t own it.“So what I know is that they have been looking for him through Interpol for a long time,” a big government official intimated to us a few minutes ago. Julius Zakayo, one of Batambuze’s aides confirmed to this writer that the Mayor is at CMI where he (Zakayo) had gone to find out why exactly the mayor was detained.“I am at CMI here outside but the guys (operatives) are very furious, I am not sure whether I will be able to talk to the mayor but I can from a distance see a car like his inside (CMI courtyard),” he said by telephone at around 3:40 pm today. How trouble unfolded for Batambuze Batambuze’s troubles started early last year with 17 of his own councilors including the ones he personally financed to assume leadership positions placed an axe on his head demanding that he quits office due to incompetence. The councilors accused Batambuze of corruption, failure to implement council resolutions and conspiring with other individuals to misuse council property. He survived the axe only after involving other leaders to engage the angry councilors. Post Views: 239
