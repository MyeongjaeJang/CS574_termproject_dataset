President Museveni has paid tribute to South African anti-apartheid campaigner Winnie-Madikizela Mandela, eulogising that her as having filled an “indispensable gap” in the fight against apartheid in South Africa. 
Mr Museveni today signed a condolence book at the South African High Commission in Kampala and eulogised Winnie Mandela as a “face” of the African National Congress (ANC), the party that championed the struggle against white minority rule. 
Winnie Mandela, 81, the former wife of South Africa's first black president Nelson Mandela was, along with her husband, an enduring figure in the resistance against white-minority rule. 
She died on April 2 in Johannesburg after a long-term illness. 
“What I wrote in that [condolence] book is that she filled an indispensable gap in the struggle of our people there. We all die but what is crucial is the memory, the contribution. Jesus died many years ago, but I am now a Christian,” Mr Museveni said. 
He added: “I doubt that she had been prepared for this role, but you can see this young lady came to this situation and ended up being the rock of the struggle. That’s why I came here to record.” advertisement
