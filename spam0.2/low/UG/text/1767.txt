Kampala. The teachers under their umbrella Uganda National Teachers Union (Unatu) have said they were not consulted over the approved revised curriculum. Mr Zadock Tumuhimbise, the Unatu chairperson, yesterday said: “Whether the President approved the curriculum, they must admit that there will be implementation challenges. We have not been involved, if the curriculum developers say they used 18 teachers, what fraction is that to more than 50,000 secondary teachers. 
And you use that to determine content that will affect tomorrow’s human resource. Really?”The National Curriculum Development Centre (NCDC) executive director, Ms Grace Baguma, declined to give details on the new development saying they needed clearance from their line ministry. She said the teachers’ denial that they were not consulted was not true as they have a panel of 18 teachers they use. 
“There is a roadmap and at an opportune time, the minister will give it to the public. Teachers participate in writing. We can’t say we don’t consult. Look at the semantics, we cannot consult everybody. We have a panel of 18 teachers we use to write this curriculum,” Ms Baguma said.The teachers are also worried that they will lose their jobs after some of their subjects were either merged or dropped.Last week, President Museveni approved an overhaul of the O-level curriculum, dropping or merging 23 subjects and approving only 20 to be taught.
