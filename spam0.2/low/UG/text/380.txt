New look Crested Cranes side for Kenya assignment   
Uganda must overturn poor fortunes against Kenya if the women’s national team Crested Cranes are to keep up hopes of making a maiden appearance at the November 17 – December 1 Africa Cup of Nations in Ghana.The last time Uganda visited Kenya in July 2016, Crested Cranes lost 4-0 at Kisumu Stadium in a friendly. When the sides met two months later at the Cecafa Women’s Championship in Njeru, the hosts suffered another loss of the same margin.The national team has not been engaged in any activity since but new coach Faridah Bulega, believes the youthful exuberance of the 30-man team she summoned on Monday for the qualifiers can get them a positive result away in Machakos on April 4.Bulega has until end of the month to name the final 18 and hopes her team will have started the five-day residential training camp by then. The sides will have their return leg at Star Times Stadium, Lugogo on April 8 and the winner of the tie will face Equatorial Guinea for a place at the finals.“I decided to go for fitness and current form when summoning the players,” Bulega told Daily Monitor. 
Twenty six players showed up for the engagement. She Mak’s Viola Namuddu, Uganda Martyrs’ Harriet Nakkuba plus Olila’s Norah Alupo and Marion Amongat were absent but joined yesterday.From the team that played Cecafa, just nine have returned with notable names like Stella Nassuna, Naume Nagadya, Fatumah Matovu and Shakira Nalwoga – all from a struggling She Corporate side – among those not summoned.“When you look at the league currently, the better players are the young ones and they can no longer be ignored. Everyone is here on merit and not because of whom they are or their past glory,” Bulega stressed.Bulega is, however, set to miss the services of reigning Fufa female player of the year Fazilah Ikwaput and Fufa Women Cup MVP (most valuable player) Ritah Nabbosa that reportedly travelled to India for a professional stint with Gokulam Kerala.“They should have been with us for sure but an opportunity to play professional football does not come every day. They only travelled three days ago and had their medicals yesterday (Monday) so we wait to see how that goes,” Bulega said.
