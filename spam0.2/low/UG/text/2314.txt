April 17, 2018 FLASHBACK: Muhammad-Kirumira-arrives-for-trial. 
Former Buyende District Police Commander (DPC) Assistant Superintendent Police (ASP) Muhammad Kirumira has today refused to attend proceedings in police tribunal shortly after journalists were blocked from accessing the court premises. 
As he arrived, ASP Kirumira forcefully opened the gate for journalists to access court premises but the other police officers tried block him, leading into an altercation that prompted the controversial officer to skip the proceedings. 
“It is my voice that changed the administration of police that was operating against laws that govern this country,” Kirumira allegedly said as they drove him to Naguru police headquarters. 
This is the second time police is blocking journalists from attending the proceedings in which Kirumira is accused of among others abuse of office and corruption. 
During his trial in February, police engaged in running battles with journalists after the officers instructed them to vacate court premises. 
Kirumira was arrested in February in Bulenga after he had announced his resignation from police. 
Subsequently, he was sent to the notorious Nalufenya police facility where he spent three weeks.
