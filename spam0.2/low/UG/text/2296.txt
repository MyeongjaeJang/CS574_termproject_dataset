EC needs 263bn for referendum on presidential term extension   
The government has not provided funding for a referendum on the extension of the presidential term of office from the current five to seven years. 
At least Ugx. 263 billion is required by the Electoral Commission to conduct the referendum in the financial year 2018/2019. The need for a referendum arose out of constitutional amendments that were approved by parliament in December 2017. - Advertisement - 
EC chairperson, Justice Simon Byabakama told the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs committee of parliament that the money is not catered for in the next financial year’s budget. Byabakama had appeared to present the commission’s budget for the coming financial year 2018/2019. 
According to the Electoral Commission, the required money will enable them fund activities such as printing ballot papers and sensitizing voters among other electoral activities. 
A referendum is provided for under Article 225(1) of the Constitution, which directs that parliament shall by law make provisions for the right of citizens to demand the holding by the Electoral Commission of a referendum, whether national or in any particular part of Uganda, on any issue. - Advertisement -
