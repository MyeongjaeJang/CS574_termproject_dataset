It was enormous as Fortebet punters (customers) from Najjanankumbi won themselves a lot of gifts over the weekend. “I just wish this happens every day. We are requesting that you keep coming back every weekend. We want more gifts because here we bet a lot,” said one of the punters (name withheld) who won a Fortebet cap. 
Like it has done, even last weekend Fortebet visited Najjanankumbi branch and rewarded its punters, as a way of appreciating and giving back to them. 
Punters got various gifts ranging from Fortebet pens, wristbands, caps, T-shirts and team jerseys of the top European teams. Atleast 25 punters left this branch with an addition of any of any of the above gifts. Over 15 were handed pens, four-T-shirts, 4-caps and 5 jerseys.

“Fortebet is your company because you own it. That is why, we make sure we serve you in the best way possible. Besides serving you, we have also come to say-thank you for choosing Fortebet as your number one betting home,” John Nanyumba, Fortebet Media manager said while speaking to the punters shortly before the gifts’ handover. 
Nanyumba further noted that, “I am not asking any questions for you to get any of these gifts neither I’m I conducting any draw. You just need to just show me your hardcopy of the betting ticket or open your online account to confirm that you placed a bet and I instantly give you your gift.” 
These got themselves Fortebet caps Nanyumba said that they have so far given out gifts to over 500 punters. “If you have not received any of Fortebet gifts, we are coming to you. All you need to do is checking our facebook page to know which branch shall get the gifts in the following weekend. Lira, get ready because this weekend we are going to be with you. Be there and win,” He concluded. SHARE
