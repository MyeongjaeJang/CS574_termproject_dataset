Why Museveni snubbed free trade summit in Rwanda   
President Museveni on monday unexpectedly cancelled his planned visit to Rwanda where leaders are due to sign an Africa-wide free trade deal – known as the African Continental Free Trade Area Treaty . 
This comes a day after Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari also opted out of the Kigali conference, saying he wanted further domestic consultation on the continental deal that would remove trade barriers and eventually allow free movement.It remains unclear why President Museveni decided to cancel the trip. - Advertisement - 
But commentators say Mr Museveni’s move suggests deteriorating relations between Kigali and Kampala. Rwanda accuses Uganda of illegally detaining its citizens and helping groups fighting its government, while Kampala accuses some Rwandans of espionage. Source: BBC
