April 13, 2018 BRUISED: Angela Katatumba after being beaten 
Celebrity singer Angela Katatumba, daughter to deceased real estate tycoon Boney Katatumba, was recently involved in a brawl with staff of Chicken Tonight and sustained bruises. Ms. Katatumba, who is also the Acting Consul of Pakistan to Uganda, in the company of visiting Jamaican artiste Kuzi Kz. This was before the altercation. 
Ms. Katatumba, who is also the Acting Consul of Pakistan to Uganda, was on Thursday morning in the company of visiting Jamaican artiste commonly known as Kuzi Kz, but information about the altercation is scanty. 
In a camera footage, Ms Katatumba is seen haggling with KFC staff identified as Manager Olubrwoth Ochoka, watchman Dennis Okirot and John Kaddu, a waiter. 
The three are all facing assault and theft charges at Kabalagala Police Station under file number CRB353/18 after Katatumba, who sustained severe bruises to her left temple, reported the incident and a ‘missing Shs6 million’ that she said she left in her bag at the counter after the scuffle broke out. 
But the incident has not gone without criticism and many are asking why the diplomat and heiress of the Katatumba Business Empire didn’t have her security detail given the odd hours at which she was travelling. 
Meanwhile, her brother Allan Katatumba said the two parties had a standoff after Ms. Katatumba and her guest were served ‘wrong’ sauce. Post Views: 912
