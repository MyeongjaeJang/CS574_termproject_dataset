Banks must prioritise housing microfinance - expert Advertisement By STEPHEN WANDERA 
Kampala. 
A new study from Habitat for Humanity has said housing microfinance should become, one of the main offers for financial institutions in Africa to respond to the growing housing needs, particularly among the poor. The study, which was released last Tuesday is based on the Building assets unlocking access, which, Habitat for Humanity has been involved in for more than six years in Kenya and Uganda. The project was a partnership between Habitat’s Terwilliger Center for Innovation in Shelter and the Mastercard Foundation. So far, the project has reached more than 47,000 households and mobilised more than $43m (Shs1.5b) in capital to benefit. The study argues that housing microfinance and small non-mortgage backed short-term loans can address growing housing needs. Uganda currently has a housing deficit of more than two million units. “Solving the housing challenges in Africa will require a massive amount of capital investment and most of that will need to come from the private sector,” said Mr Patrick Kelley, the vice president of Habitat’s Terwilliger Center for Innovation in Shelter in a press statement. Financial institutions of all kinds, according to Mr Kelley, have a role to play, especially those that are already deeply embedded in communities with a deep understanding of the informal sector. According to the study, there is need for housing microfinance, especially for families or individuals earning as little as $5 (Shs18,000) a day. “This report should help financial service providers to scale these products, which would benefit their enterprises as well as the lives of many poor people in Africa,” said Ruth Dueck-Mbeba, senior programme manager at the MasterCard Foundation. advertisement
