Support URA to improve tax management, report urges Advertisement By Christine Kasemiire 
Kampala. 
Different actors including government bodies ought to work hand in hand with Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) to efficiently conduct tax administration, a report by Seatini Uganda has said. The recommendation was issued in a report unveiled by Seatini Uganda last week in Kampala, encompassing 14 organisations, focusing on the effectiveness of the Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool, (TADAT) ushered in 2015 in Uganda. TADAT is a tool created by World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other financial players, comprising nine indicators, used to assess the performance of a country’s tax administration system with the view of informing policy reform.According to the report, not much has been done in relation to improving performance on the indicators. The conclusion was based on an assessment done in 2015 and a mock assessment by URA in 2017.The lead researcher, Mr George Bogere, said legal reforms and lack of cooperation of different actors in performance of the indicators are the biggest impediments to effective tax administration.“Without legal reforms, many interventions cannot be implemented and the different actors must have a shared vision and objective in the performance of TADAT,” he said.He added that while the assessment focuses on URA, the ministry of Finance has a duty to oversee their activities as their supervisor.Reacting to the report, the Uganda resident representative of International Monetary Fund, Ms Clara Mira, agreed with many of the recommendations, emphasizing the need to align compliance with tax education to achieve revenue targets. advertisement
