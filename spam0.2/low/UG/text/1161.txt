President Yoweri Museveni has spilled secrets on why his right hand has been bandaged for close to two weeks. 
Museveni revealed the secrets while responding to one of his followers of his Facebook page. 
“Is concerned with my bandaged right – hand. I am, since 1976, an amateur Karate practitioner. Those exercises help in fitness even when I come from office at midnight. I do the exercises , once in a while. I sprained my wrist. It is healing. The Karate skills were part of the unarmed ones that are acquired in the security forces even today,” Museveni said in response to Tom-Jones. 
There had been speculation about what could have happened to his hand after he emerged with a bandaged right hand when welcoming Rwandan President Paul Kagame at State House, Entebbe. 
Kagame was in the country for bilateral talks with Museveni following rumors of strained relations between the two East Africa nations.
