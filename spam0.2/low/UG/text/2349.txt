The UPDF has promised to investigate alleged torture in Mbuya Military Barracks. 
The development comes in response to claims by Butambala Member of Parliament, Mr Muwanga Kivumbi that Mbuya Barracks has become a torture hub.This was during a meeting between MPs and officials from the Ministry of Defence at Parliament on Tuesday. 
Mr Kivumbi said he has been approached by several people who claim to have been arrested and taken to the barracks where they were blindfolded and tortured. 
Mr Kivumbi called for thorough investigations into the alleged torture by operatives of the Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence (CMI). CMI is the investigative department of the UPDF. 
Although UPDF and Defence Ministry officers were sceptical about the allegations, they promised to investigate the reports. 
The State Minister for Veteran Affairs, Mr Bright Rwairama said the UPDF does not have any torture chamber in Uganda. 
He, however, hastened to add that the facility in question, has been used to hold some terrorists for interagency interrogation. advertisement
