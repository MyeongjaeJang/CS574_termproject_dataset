Athletes from Kampala Capital City Authority sports clubs will each go to the Commonwealth Games with an extra Shs1.8m [about $500] for upkeep courtesy of the Authority. Before handing over the cash envelopes at City Hall on Friday, KCCA executive director Jenifer Musisi commended the athletes for representing the Authority’s brand of excellence and urged them to show commitment while representing the country in Commonwealth Games. “We as KCCA are proud that we have many athletes representing the country at the Commonwealth Games, in addition to what the football team is doing, Musisi said in the meeting. “I think progressively we are taking over…so we are committed to invest in sports as a sector that brings together people of all walks of life. But also as an area that needs professionalising.” All the five boxers going for the Games beginning April 5 Gold Coast, Australia come from KCCA Boxing Club just like 2018 national cross country champion Thomas Ayeko. In total, the Authority tipped them with Shs10.8m, in addition to the $100 government committed to their daily allowances for 14 days. Lord Mayor Erias Lukwago also lauded the athletes’ commitment and tasked them to go for not less than gold. “I know you must have gone through a rigorous selection process and I believe you are going for gold,” Lukwago told the team with emphasis on runners. “The Kenyans and Ethiopians are still ahead of us but we are not far away…we can catch up. I wish you the best of luck.”
