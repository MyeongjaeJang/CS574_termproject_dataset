PARLIAMENT: The cabinet is not ready to present tax bills for the next financial year, Parliament has been told. 
The Minister of State for Planning, David Bahati promised to the House last week that he would be presenting actual appropriations and the tax bills today. 
However, when the matter came up on the order Paper on Tuesday afternoon, the minister only apologized saying that there is a mishap. 
“Rt Hon Speaker, I request for five minutes then I come back,” said Bahati. 
The deputy speaker, Jacob Oulanyah looked on with desperation and asked:“Hon Minister what is it with these bills?”Bahati replied: “I do apologise, there is some confusion which I'm correcting.” 
Parliament has on several occasions blamed the Executive for delaying business in the House especially during the budgeting process. 
The Bills expected include; the Appropriations Bill 2018, Finance (amendment)Bill 2018, Income Tax Bill 2018, Value Added Tax Bill 2018 and the Excise Duty Tax 2018 as well as Stamp Duty Tax, 2018. 
These inform revenue sources for the financial year 2018/19.
