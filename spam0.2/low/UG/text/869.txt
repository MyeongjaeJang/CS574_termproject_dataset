Two things have happened in Uganda recently that are quite telling. Both incidents depict Uganda as a country whose citizens are losing all their rights slowly but surely. First, the Ministry of Health announced that the vaccines that were administered to citizens against Hepatitis B were fake. 
Ugandans recall that early last year, the same ministry mobilised Ugandans to go to health facilities and be vaccinated against Hapatitis B. I am sure that many good health-seeking Ugandans along with their family members responded positively. 
What is disturbing is that since that announcement, all the relevant authorities have remained mute. Nobody bothers to imagine many Ugandans who got this vaccine are worried and neither are they guided on what to do. 
There was word that the Health ministry and National Drug Authority that are responsible for the importation, verification and certification of all drugs and supplies in Uganda would investigate the matter. 
The question is, why havenâ€™t they explained or guided the people on what to do? The Health ministry should not burry its head in the sand. Frank Mutagubya,
