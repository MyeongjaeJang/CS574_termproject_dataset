Kampala. A businessman has sued Kampala Archdiocese demanding Shs85m for supplying bales of special printed holocaust clothes six years ago. 
Mr Mustapha Lubega claims that in May 2012, he entered an agreement with Kampala Archdioceses and Mr Charles Kasule to supply 200 bales of the special printed Martyrs holocaust clothes each containing 4,000 pieces at Shs21,250 each translating into Shs85m. 
Mr Lubega said the goods were conveyed to Uganda Martyrs Shrine Development Foundation (UMSDF) under a cash-on-delivery basis. 
According to the court documents, the archdiocese subsequently confirmed the delivery of the said commodities and sought tax exemption, which was granted by Uganda Revenue Authority. 
“UMSDF presented itself as the subsidiary of the dioceses authorising the first defendant (Mr Kasule) to act on its behalf and the plaintiff (Mr Lubega) dealt with him in all the dealings,” reads part of the petition. 
Mr Lubega said he supplied the commodities as per the agreement but Kampala Archdiocese refused and or neglected to pay him despite repeated demand notices and intention to sue. He contends that as a result, he has suffered loss and damages. 
Attempt On June 6, 2013, Mr Lubega’s lawyers wrote to the Archbishop informing him of the matter. “Take notice therefore that our client’s money must be paid within seven days from the date of receipt hereof plus Shs1,600,000 being legal cost. We believe that this matter can be settled amicably,” reads the letter in part. jkigongo@ug.nationmedia.com
