Two youth were last Friday rescued by police from a mob that wanted to lynch them for allegedly stealing pork. 
Samuel Muhoozi, a police officer said Patrick magada, 20, and his colleague Isaac Mutebe were at Nabirumba Road Pork joint where they ordered for a kilogram of fried pork. They then engaged the female chef in loose talk. On seeing that she was engrossed in the conversation, one of them begun to pick some pieces of pork from another customerâ€™s plate that the chef was yet to deliver. He hid them in the deep pockets of his jacket. 
The seller realized that the pieces she had set aside for a regular customer were missing. It is after she saw a bulging jacket pocket that she raised an alarm which attracted other customers who surged to beat up the boys. 
On their way to Kamuli Police station, the duo confessed that they had hosted some girls for the night who wanted Pork but were only left with the lodge fees and their transport back to Jinja. advertisement
