KAMPALA- The last time the Under-17 Cecafa Youth Championship were held was in 2009 when the Cubs defeated Eritrea 2-0 to clinch the title.Since then, the tournament has been in a nine-year slumber that was ended yesterday as Somalia and Ethiopia tussled it out in the opening game.Today, the Cubs also make their first appearance against Tanzania as they get their title defence underway. 
The ensuing period has seen little action for the Cubs, who last had a competitive game in the 2015 Africa Under-17 final qualification round against Zambia back in 2014. With the previous squad of Muhammad Shaban, Frank “Zaga” Tumwesigye, Bashir Asiku and Julius Poloto having graduated to the Under 20s, this tournament represents a good opportunity for the current crop. 
Peter Onen, a coaching assistant to Mathias Lule in 2014, is now at the helm and will be expected to continue with the playing style and results that pleased many. 
At his disposal is Vipers Junior Team playmaker Ivan Asaba, who is expected to provide the creative spark alongside club mate Moses Bakkabulindi. 
Upfront Onen, who is also assistant coach at topflight league club Bul, is expected to rely on the scoring prowess of Sula Mpanga whose 15 junior league goals make him the joint second top scorer in the league. There should also be a place for Onduparaka JT’s Iddi Abdulwahid, who has 12 league goals to his name in the squad that also includes Jimmy Muber from Paidha Primary School. 
Eight teams are expected to take part in the competition with Uganda placed in Group B alongside Tanzania, Sudan and Zanzibar. The top two teams in each group qualify for the semifinals.
