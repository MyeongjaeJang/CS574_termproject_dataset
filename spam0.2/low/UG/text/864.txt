SOROTI- Maj Gen Mugisha Muntu, the former president of the Opposition Forum for Democratic Change has said that his nation-wide consultations with party supporters, are not intended to frustrate the leadership of his predecessor, Mr Patrick Amuriat. 
Addressing party supporters and opinion leaders in Soroti town at the home of the Soroti Woman Member of Parliament, Ms Angelina Osegge, Mr Muntu said the consultations have nothing to do with the election of Mr Amuriat as party president. 
He said his meetings are aimed at seeking views from party supporters on the current challenges they are facing and above all; to find ways how to uproot President Yoweri Museveni from power. 
“I lost in Namboole and handed office to Amuriat. So, I am not fighting or working towards his downfall but I believe FDC as a party has unresolved issues that need to be addressed if we are to galvanise support for regime change,” Gen. Muntu said. 
According to Gen Muntu, Uganda, under the leadership of President Museveni is “sitting on a time bomb” arising from high levels of poverty, anger among the populace and therefore, FDC needs to work harder “scientifically” to finds ways of “defusing” the bomb. 
Mr Muntu said as political actors, they are studying the environment because politics is about playing with science in order to grow and survive, adding that the supporters should learn to be scientific and put aside emotions. 
However, Ms Anna Grace Akao, advised Gen Muntu to ensure that he works Mr Amuriat to promote party interests. 
Mr Dab Opinya, a supporter of the Democratic Party, who attended the meeting said the consultations by Gen Muntu have been interpreted by some people in Teso region as effort to disturb Mr Amuriat’s leadership. advertisement
