Kampala, Uganda | GODFREY SSALI | Two out of three Court of Appeal Justices Alfonse Owinyi Ddolo the Deputy Chief Justice and Paul Mugamba have nullified the election of NRM’s Winfred Matsiko Komuhangi as Woman MP Rukungiri District, and declared her seat vacant. 
The two ordered the Electoral Commission to organise fresh elections, and further ordered Matsiko to pay Betty Muzanira Bamukwatsa costs she has incurred in prosecuting her petition. 
The Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) party’s Betty Muzanira accused Matsiko of committing electoral malpractice of giving donations during the campaign period. 
The two Judges after re-evaluating the evidence on record in respect of allegations of donations, they found sufficient evidence to prove that Mastiko made donations at Kibale Catholic Church and Nyarushanje Catholic Church. 
However former Deputy Chief Justice Steven Kavuma did not agree with the two Justices saying there was no specific evidence adduced pinning Kobusingye on the allegations of bribery. Share on:
