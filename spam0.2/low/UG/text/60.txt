March 19, 2018 SUPPORTED SCRAPPING OF EVENING PROGRAMME: Education expert and former Uganda National Examinations Board chairman, Fagil Mande 
Education expert and former Uganda National Examinations Board chairman, Fagil Mande has expressed support for Makerere University Council’s decision to scrap evening lectures, beginning next academic year. 
Speaking to KFM, Mande said the Council had made the right decision, arguing that the programme cannot guarantee the quality of education. 
Mande’s remarks come after a few days after the Vice Chancellor of the University Prof Barnabas Nawangwe announced that Makerere was scrapping the program as a result of inadequate revenue and debts. 
He anchored his arguments on wear of both lecturers and students in the evening, saying that with tired lecturers and students, a decline in the quality of education is inevitable. ANNOUNCED DECISION: Makerere University VC Prof. Barnabas Nawangwe 
Mande used the same platform to condemn former vice chancellor Prof Venansius Baryamureeba for his reaction towards the decision which, Prof. Nawangwe told the press Friday, had been reached because the university could no longer sustain the expenses associated with running evening programmes. 
Evening programmes were introduced at Makerere University in the early 90s. 
Meanwhile, as part of the new changes, the University will also abolish catering services and will instead give the 2,000 government students residing at the university cash amounting to 476,000/= per semester for food.
