Kampala, Uganda | GODFREY SSALI | High Court Judge Wilson Masalu Musene compels prosecution to close its evidence against ninteen treason suspects including a woman who is related to Australian based Cardiologist , Dr. Aggrey Kiyingi. 
Justice Musene noted that much he has heard evidence of nine witnesses, the State has not shown any seriousness in prosecuting this case, by causing unnecessary adjournments to summon witnesses in a case that was brought to Court in 2014. 
State prosecutor Thomas Jatiko yesterday again wanted more time to consult the DPP Mike Chibita on the way forward after another witness failed to turn up in Court . 
Aisha Nakasibante and eighteen others are facing charges of treason and concealment of treason in which they are alleged to have contrived a plot to over throw the government of Uganda by force of firearms. 
Prosecution says this was between years; 2013 and 2015 in various places in Uganda , Dubai , Kenya and Tanzania. 
Prosecution further states that the accused expressed this plot through utterances , recruitment and training of rebels, acquiring satellite mobile phones for communication, motorcycles and vehicles for transport and also rented houses to act as safe houses to accomplish their mission. 
Now the Court is yet to set a date to deliver its ruling on whether the accused persons have a case requiring them to be put on their defence. Share on:
