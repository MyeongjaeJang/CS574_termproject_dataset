MTN Uganda has issued a formal apology to Justine Bagyenda, the former Bank of Uganda executive director (Supervision) over her leaked mobile money records. 
The mobile money records that leaked about a week ago showed the extent of Bagyenda’s wealth. 
Leaked documents showed that Bagyenda’s mobile number (07727*86*9), made transactions amounting to Shs 500 million in three years to a one Robert Muhumuza. The MTN statement 
“We wish to unreservedly apologize to Ms. Justine Bagyenda for the inconvenience this incident may have caused her,” an MTN apology issued today partly reads. 
The telecom company also said that it had handed over the people, suspected of having leaked the information, to the relevant authorities. 
Diamond Trust Bank, Centenary Bank and Barclays Bank have so far apologised to Bagyenda when her account details in the banks leaked indicating she had more than Shs19 billion. 
The Financial Intelligence Authority picked interest in Bagyenda’s matters as her bank transactions were akin to money laundering. Post Views: 1,763
