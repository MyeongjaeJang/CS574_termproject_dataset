On returning from Zimbabwe where the Rugby Sevens Cranes finished third in the second edition of the Victoria Falls 7s, the side has switched focus to the upcoming gigantic tasks in shape of the HSBC World Rugby Series Qualifiers and the Commonwealth Games.The events in Hong Kong and Australia which occur in a space of nine days have seen coach Tolbert Onyango name the side for the trips with three notable changes. Talisman Phillip Wokorach, Pius Ogena and Lawrence Sebuliba return to replace Timothy Mudoola, Al Hadji Manano and James Ijongat.It is clear cut that success in the series qualifiers would bring bigger returns than any other event the side will participate in this year. A sole spot as core side in the series in up for grabs and achieving the feat would steer Uganda rugby to greater heights with the shorter version of the game gaining the most.“We are positive that if we stick to our structures and exercise patience, we shall finish strong in the series qualifiers,” Onyango told Daily Monitor.Onyango has also squashed fears of fatigue holding back his players considering that they will compete in two major tournament at venues separated by over 700km and 12 hours of flight.“We have done it before with Dubai and Cape Town for two years in a row, so we can handle it. We have four days before each tournament which is enough recovery time,” he reasoned.Joseph Aredo, Desire Ayera, Ivan Magomu, Timothy Kisiga and Aaron Ofoyrwoth will debut in Hong Kong where Uganda managed a last eight finish last year. The side departs on Easter for Hong Kong before Australia.Uganda will feature in pool E with Japan, Chile and Georgia for the qualifiers while they find themselves in the same group as Sri Lanka, Fiji and Wales at the Commonwealth Games. advertisement
