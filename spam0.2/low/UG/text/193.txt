Kampala. The Cranes yesterday started preparations for the two upcoming build up matches against Sao Tome and Prinicpe on Saturday and Malawi three days later.The session that took place under the evening downpour at Mandela National Stadium saw 20 of the 24 players summoned by coach Sebastien Desabre take part.Inevitably though, most of the attention was directed at defender Bevis Mugabi who is in line to make his debut in those two games.Mugabi, who turns out for English fourth tier side Yeovil Town was summoned two years ago by previous coach Micho Sredojevic but turned down the invitation. 
“I think when I got my previous call ups I was fairly young at the time but now I’m like 22 and I’m a bit more mature with my build and the way I play so I feel it is the right to make to accept the call and come to Uganda,” said Mugabi after the 40-minute session.Having been born in London, he was eligible to represent England or Uganda at international level and played youth football for Fulham and Southampton before signing for Yeovil Town in August 2016. 
“I know a little bit about Uganda but I still got a lot more things to learn but that’s why I’m here to keep learning and educating myself so hopefully that will come in the next few days I’m here. I can add quite a bit hopefully I get selected again I get selected again I’ll come and show everyone what I can do,” he added.Mugabi who prefers to play as ac entre back has also been played as a right back for his England based club. 
It was the first session for the foreign-based players under Desabre who was appointed in December last year.“The players who will get an opportunity to play on Saturday and Tuesday will have to show the new coach that they deserve to be part of the national team,” Egypt based Hassan Wasswa noted.
