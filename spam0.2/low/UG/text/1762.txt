Lawyers representing the petitioners challenging the consolidated presidential age limit case, on Tuesday said that the extension of the office term of the President, Parliament and local government was merely smuggled into the age limit Bill.Counsel Erias Lukwago who is representing the six opposition MPs, argued that office extensions were an afterthought as they were not originally part of the age limit Bill before it was passed into law. 
“Those sections came out of the blue, they came as an afterthought due to selfish interests and the same can’t be sustained,” Mr Lukwago argued.He continued: “The Bill was specifically to amend Article 102 (b) and not extend the term of MPs, President and local government.”Mr Lukwago went on to submit to court that Article 91 of the Constitution is very clear that the power shall be exercised through Bills. 
“So all these issues have to be canvassed and captured in the Bill so that the legislators and the people of Uganda understand what is in the Bill. Parliament should not discuss these matters in such a casual manner,” he argued.During the heated debate of the age limit Bill late last year, Speaker of Parliament, Rebecca Kadaga was shocked when the issue of extending the term of office of the President, Parliament and the local government to seven years from five mysteriously came up on the floor of Parliament and she demanded an explanation. 
During the court proceedings, lawyer Nestor Kaganzi, weighed in and submitted that several MPs on the Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee of Parliament that scrutinised the presidential age limit Bill, said the original Bill did not contain the provisions to extend the term of office of the President, Parliament and local council.He went ahead and named some of the MPs as Ibrahim Semujju Nganda, Muhammad Nsereko and Monica Amoding. 
Another lawyer, Mr James Byamukama, argued that Article 77 (4) of the Constitution only allows the extension of Parliament in circumstances of state of war in the country before emphasising that the extension can only be for six months and not two years as the MPs did.He went on to stress that such an extension of term of office has to be around election time and that in this situation, the extension did not come towards the period of holding general elections. 
Mr Byamukama also argued that he wouldn’t mind much if the extension of the term of office applied to the 11th Parliament but instead the MPs of the 10th Parliament backdated it to 2016 for their selfish interests.He also brought to the attention of the court that the secretary to treasury, Mr Keith Muhakanizi only prepared a certificate of financial implication for the presidential age limit but there was none for the extension of office terms of MPs, President and the local government council. 
In his prayers to the court, Mr Lukwago asked the court to annul these office extensions.“This particular Constitutional Court should make history for this country by applying the best structured doctrine to create a situation of constitutional stability and ensure that whoever has an ambition to entrench themselves in power, will not have it their way,” Mr Lukwago said. 
The deputy Attorney General, Mr Rukutana is expected to respond to these issues raised by the petitioners’ lawyers on Thursday. The justices presiding over the consolidated presidential age limit petition are; Alfonse Owiny-Dollo, the Deputy Chief Justice who is also heading the panel, Remmy Kasule, Elizabeth Musoke, Cheborion Barishaki and Kenneth Kakuru. editorial@ug.nationmedia.com
