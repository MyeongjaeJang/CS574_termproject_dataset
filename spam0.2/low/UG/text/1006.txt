March 30, 2018 Residents of Kasasira Sub-County demonstrate over the poor state of the road. 
Uganda National Roads Authority has reinstated Dott Services Limited in the construction of Nakalama-Tirinyi-Mbale Road following termination of their contract 2017. In May last year UNRA terminated the Shs73.3 billion contract with Dott Services, the then civil works contractor for the 102 kilometers road, prompted by the delayed progress of works on the project. According to UNRA, the construction was behind schedule by over 60 per cent at the time despite several warnings to the contractor. Speaking in the committee of infrastructure in Parliament yesterday, the Director for Roads and Bridges at UNRA Eng. Samuel Muhoozi said the all issues between the two bodies were resolved and on March 23, this year, they appended their signatures to Shs135 billion contract to rehabilitated 102 kilometer road. He noted that the supervising body is waiting for a construction company to present their performance guarantee from their banking company for commencement of the project. He noted that the construction is expected to be executed within a period of 22 month however it will start in a fortnight. The reinstating of the company follows president Museveni’s innervation in January directing the executive director of UNRA Allen Kagina to rescind their decision and advised her to amicably solve issues with Dott services for the construction to resume. “I had been incensed by that information. Later, however, I learnt that, apparently, Dott Services is a big company, worth US$100 million and that it is not just in road construction…he wrote In one of the meetings, Museveni is reported to have threatened that if leaders at UNRA don’t listen to him over Nakalama-Tirinyi and Lumino-Busia, he would mobile money and pay the contractors to finish the work and this could have pushed UNRA to bring back Dott.
