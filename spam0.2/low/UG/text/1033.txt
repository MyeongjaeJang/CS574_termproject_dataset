Coach Mutebi to leave KCCA for Cranes Job. Mutebi could be back at Cranes soon. Advertisement By ELVIS SENONO 
KAMPALA . KCCA manager Mike Mutebi as he often prefers to be called, is set for a sensational return to the Cranes fold.Credible information reaching the Sunday Monitor indicates that the former Simba and SC Villa tactician has been hand picked by current Cranes coach Sebastien Desabre to assist him ahead of future engagements. 
Mutebi, who keenly followed proceedings at Mandela National Stadium as the Cranes defeated Sao Tome and Principe 3-1 before a goalless draw with Malawi, was seen emerging from the Cranes dressing room after the latter result on Tuesday. 
The latest development would represent a surprising turnaround for Mutebi, who has previously quashed talk of him returning to the national team coaching role he spearheaded 14 years ago. Desabre is under pressure having presided over one win in seven games since taking charge of the job in December.His next competitive assignment comes in September against Tanzania by which time this Fools Day joke will be six months old!
