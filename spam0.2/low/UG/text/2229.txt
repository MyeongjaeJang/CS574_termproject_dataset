The former Zanzibar president, Mr Amani Abeid Karume, who visited Uganda last week, has said they are inviting Martin Luther King III as a keynote speaker for this year’s global peace conference in Kampala.Martin Luther King III is the eldest son of American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr and a community and rights activist whose presence, organisers hope, will bring global attention to the summit. 
Duty Speaking at Makerere University Business School on Friday, Mr Karume said: “I have been asked to reach out to him and I will do that and I hope he will accept our invitation as the guest speaker to come and speak to us during the conference in Munyonyo which President Museveni has gladly [accepted] to host.” 
The Global Peace Conference will be held between August 1 and 3 under the theme; Moral and Innovative Leadership: New Models for Sustainable Peace and Development.Mr David Caprara, the vice president for Strategic Partnerships at Global Peace Foundation, told an April 12 meeting at State House that the summit will attract 1,000 multi-sector leaders from African parliaments, business, faith, women, youth, journalists and other sectors. 
Why theme? “We chose the theme, together with the African Leadership Mission, chaired by Mr Karume and the Uganda national organising committee to provide solutions required for peace and an African-led renaissance targeting the UN 2030 goals on peace and development as a yardstick to measure progress,” he said. 
Mr Karume said he had visited to lobby President Museveni to accept to host the second Global Peace Conference organised by the Global Peace Foundation which, according to him, is usually hosts conferences in countries prone to instability.Asked whether they foresee conflict in Uganda, he said Uganda demonstrated a country that had rebounded from a bloody past and the world would be interested to hear and learn how they achieved the transformation.
