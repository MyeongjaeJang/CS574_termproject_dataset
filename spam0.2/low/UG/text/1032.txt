KAMPALA. Coach Farida Bulega’s Crested Cranes are looking heavily reliant on Hasifah Nassuna for goals.It will likely be the case in their April 4 Africa Women’s Cup qualifier with Kenya in Machakos. Nassuna has scored in all three build games against Kampala Junior Team, Kampala Select and in Friday’s 2-0 win over Uganda Christian University (UCU) Lady Cardinals at Islamic University in Uganda (IUIU) Campus in Kabojja. “I am happy the balls are crossing the goal line,” Bulega said, downplaying their reliance on Nassuna. She has reason to as Spencer Nakachwa scored the other goal. 
Top scorer Juliet Nalukenge and Damalie Matama have been among the goals too in other practice games but Nassuna’s contribution speaks for itself. The striker will also pick confidence from the fact that she was top scorer at the Cecafa Women’s Championship in 2016, when the two countries last met. Uganda have a poor record against their eastern neighbours but Bulega believes she can count on the youthfulness of her side for a result in Machakos.“We are getting stronger each passing day. The fitness levels of the team are not top notch but the spirits are high and all players are learning a lot of new things during this camp,” Bulega added.
