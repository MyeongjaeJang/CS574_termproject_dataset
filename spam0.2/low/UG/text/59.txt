Divisions under Kampala Metropolitan South have since Friday commenced on sting operations against the famous ‘Kifesi’ criminals terrorizing and disorganizing the public during business hours. This comes after various complaints of bag and phone snatching, drug abuse, simple robberies around the City and during traffic rush hour times. 
The operations are commanded by the Kampala Metropolitan South Commander ACP. Denis Namuwoza, the area commanders while being assisted by crime preventers. The operations are majorly focusing on areas around Katwe, Mini Price, Ben Kiwanuka,Market Street,Clock Tower Nakivubo Channel, Makindye, Salaama,Kibuye,Kabalagala and Ndejje. Namuwoza said the criminal gangs penetrating the city make it hard for the public to conduct their businesses normally. - Advertisement - 
“This is the time to bring back sanity in the city so that people can stop living in fear,” he said. With the assistance from local leaders, over 300 suspects including those on police watchlist have been arrested,subjected to screening and are to be arraigned before courts of law. 
However the Kampala Metropolitan Police Spokesperson Luke Owoyesigire explained that however much police is doing its role of arresting criminals, there is still a challenge of courts releasing them immediately back to the communities which undermines the efforts of the well intended operations.
