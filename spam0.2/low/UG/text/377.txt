KAMPALA. 
The Stanbic Uganda Cup round of 16 games involving SC Villa and Vipers had been dominated by the decisions of their respective opponents Ndejje University and Kira United passing up opportunities to host the games.If that was supposed to leave the two Big League teams at a huge disadvantage, it didn’t reflect as they lost to identical 1-0 scorelines.At Wankulukulu, Villa the supposed visitors against Ndejje enjoyed the majority of possession but were largely wasteful. It took a 42nd minute header from right back Joseph Nsubuga off a Martin Kizza freekick to separate the teams.The goal came after George Ssenkaaba, Allan Kyambadde and Godfrey Lwesibawa all missed one on one opportunities either side of half time.“Being a cup game it was very tight but we managed to progress. We have the depth and quality to compete on two fronts,” Villa coach Paul Mukatabala stated after the game.Ndejje coach Raymond Komakech meanwhile defended his team’s decision to move the game.“We could not guarantee enough security for the players and fans in Ndejje,” he said of the institution that hosts Big League games at their main campus in Luweero.At Kitende, Erisa Sekisambu turned to be the hero for Miguel Da Costa’s side scoring a penalty just after half time.They are joined in the last eight by another Big League side Kansai Plascon who thrashed relegation threatened Mabarara.
