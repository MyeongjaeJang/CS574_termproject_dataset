How to treat damaged hair Advertisement By Phionah Nassanga 
You can identify damaged hair by its harsh texture, breakage, lack of elasticity and split ends. However, Williams Hillary Alinda, a manager at Beyond Beauty Salon in Kampala, says most of these can be treated at home. 
Avocado Mash a ripe avocado and mix it with the white of one egg. Wet your hair ensuring that water gets to the scalp, then apply the mixture and massage. Cover with a shower cap for about one hour and rinse with warm water to ensure the scalp is clean. Alinda says this adds much needed protein to hair and can be repeated every two weeks. 
Baking soda Get one to two tablespoons of baking soda and mix it with water until you form a thick paste. Apply this to damp hair and cover for 15 minutes, rinse and then shampoo. This will help to break down acidity. 
Apple vinegar Mix one teaspoon of apple cider vinegar with three egg whites and two tablespoons of olive oil. Rub the mixture into your hair and cover for half an hour. Rinse your hair with shampoo. 
Olive oil Warm half a cup of olive oil and apply it on your scalp and hair. Cover with a shower cap and towel for an hour. This heals damaged layers of the hair by sealing the cuticle with moisture. 
Honey Mix one to two tablespoons of olive oil, one egg yolk and half a cap of honey. Massage the mixture into clean and damp hair and let it sit for 20 minutes then rinse with warm water. advertisement
