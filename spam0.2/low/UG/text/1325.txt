Kampala, Uganda | GODFREY SSALI | A group of Nansana Municipality voters have asked the Constitutional Court to overturn a decision of the High Court in Kampala that declared Robert Kasule Ssebunya the validly elected Member of Parliament (MP) for that Constituency. 
They want Court to order a by election in the Wakiso District constituency, so that their choose their representative themselves. 
The Petitioners Fred Lwanga Mugerwa , Margaret Namiiro , Ritah Nalunkuuma , Annet Nakiyingi , John Nakabaale , Ntale Kuraish Kalema, Isaac Ssali together with National Action for Awakening Uganda(Sisimuka Uganda) have sued the Attorney General, the Electoral Commission and MP Ssebunya. 
They want a panel of five Constitutional Court Justices to interpret the Judgement of High Court Judge Vicent Okwanga that was confirmed by the Court of Appeal, without giving the electorate an opportunity to elect a leader of their choice, a decision that disenfranchised them. 
The matter was had come up on wednesday for parties to inform the Constitutional Court Deputy Registrar Esther Nambayo on how to proceed, but the respondents in this case did not turn up in Court and another date of May 30, was given by the Registrar. 
Last year Court of Appeal nullified the election of DP’s Wakayima Musoke as Nansana Municipality MP, after concurring with High Court Judge Vincent Okwanga, that the name Wakayima Musoke Nsereko which he used for his nomination for the seat, did not appear in the voters’ register of Nansana Municipality, but rather the name Musoke Hannington Nsereko which validly appears on his national identification card. 
The Judge then declared NRM’s Ssebunya, who had become second in the elections, as the area MP, which meant that NRM’s Sebunya was to replace Wakayima in Parliament without going through a by-election. Share on:
