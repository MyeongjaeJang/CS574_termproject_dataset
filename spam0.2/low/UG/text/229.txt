Unfortunately, the artists has waited for promise in vain despite the several reminders. Mukasa’s lawyers also accuse Bryan White of engaging their client in Mbarara for two days while exploiting his talent yet fail to meet his end of the bargain which was to give him residence at the hotel, pay for his performance and meals as agreed. “Our client has made efforts to secure payments for his song, his performances and refund of his costs incurred but in vein,” a demand notice to Bryan White reads in part. 
“In an unfortunate reversal of events, you Bryan White and your agents have turned to character assassinate our client, branding him as a thief and using police agents to illegally kidnap and detain our client. A case in point is on Saturday march 17, where after a trap by your agents one Sekamate and Musa, our client was kidnapped by plain clothed army persons who later dropped him at Katwe Police station and hardly 10 minutes later you Bryan White appeared at the police station with multiple threats,” the notice continues. Bryn White has been given seven days to clear their client’s demands or face courts of law. Bryn White recently paraded Mukasa before press and labeled him a renowned thief. - Advertisement -
