Big guns smile away after getting ‘easy’ Stanbic Uganda Cup ties Advertisement By DENIS BBOSA 
KAMPALA. 
For the umpteenth time, Uganda Premier League title contenders SC Villa, Vipers and KCCA were kept apart in the Uganda Cup quarterfinal draws held yesterday.Questions lingered at a fully packed Fufa House media room, how the four remaining sides Proline, Villa, KCCA and Vipers could have evaded meeting each other but the fact that the draws had been conducted by Uganda Cranes legends Sam Kabugo and Jackson Mayanja in broadlight at least cooled the doubts.To SC Villa coach Wasswa Bbosa, a league and cup double is now in sight even if they meet a KJT side that has already eliminated URA and Bul.“At least we can now plan for the semifinals as we keep our lead in the league. We are the favourites at Villa Park,” Bbosa told Daily Monitor after the draws at Mengo.Vipers Technical Director Eddie Butindo revealed his team can go to Mukono to face Fufa Big League side Kansai Plascon with a lot of optimism.“We have done fairly well in the league and we hope to have a great run in the Uganda Cup too. This was a fair draw,” Butindo stressed. Reigning champions KCCA, tied on nine Uganda Cup titles with nemesis Villa, will trek to Boma Grounds in Hoima to face Kitara. The Fufa Big League side ejected 10-time winners Express at the same ground and will aim to have a scalp of Mike Mutebi’s side on the weekend April 22 and 29. In the women’s version, Kawempe Muslim taking on Kampala Queens will highlight the round of 16 draws of the second edition of the Fufa Women’s Cup.
