Tweet Golden Chesang 
Uganda’s Stella Chesang has secured Uganda’s second gold medal when she won the tough 10,000 meter race at the Commonwealth games in Australia. And as if that wasn’t good enough, another Ugandan Mercyline Chelangat came in close third place which helped her and indeed Uganda get a Bronze medal. 
Chesang and Chelangat victories bring to three medals so far won at the bi-annual Commonnwealth games taking place in the Australian city of Gold Coast #GC2018. Yesterday Joshua Cheptegei won the 5000 meter race to earn Uganda its first Gold medal.
