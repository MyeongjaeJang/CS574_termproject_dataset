Katikkiro Peter Mayiga stops convoy to help accident victim   
Buganda Prime Minister Charles Peter Mayiga on Tuesday made a stop-over along Sir Apollo Kaggwa Road in Kampala to help a woman in her late 20’s who was involved in a road accident. 
Mayiga, who was traveling to Kyaggwe to check on the progress of Coffee farmers, reportedly saw Mary Kiconco lying on the ground without help. Eyewitnesses say, Mayiga stopped his convoy, put Mary Kiconco in his own vehicle and rushed her to Kawempe Hospital before he continued with his journey to Kyaggwe for the Emmwanyi Terimba campaign. - Advertisement - 
November last year, Mayiga visited Bugerere County in a bid to encourage the people of Buganda engage in coffee farming in order to get rid of poverty and also to launch “Emmwanyi Terimba” campaign. 
During the visit, Katikkiro visited several farmers in different parts of Bugerere namely; Bikongoolo Kahlid of Bbaale sub county, Bilali of Gayaza Sub County and Ponsiano Lutaaya of Bukonya village. 
In his address to the people who gathered at the different stopping centers, Katikkiro urged the youths to stop the fear that is inside their hearts and start venturing in coffee farming activities as a way of fighting poverty that is rampant especially among the youths and also to better their standards of living. - Advertisement -
