How confidential are work surveys? Solomon Muhiirwa Advertisement By Solomon Muhiirwa 
Last year we received an all-staff email requesting us to fill a confidential survey about our departments. So, being confidential, I gave a true picture of our department, including negative aspects. However, since then, my manager has been cold towards me. How confidential are such surveys? Sekabembe 
Dear Sekabembe,The minute feedback goes out whether anonymous or not, it’s no longer confidential. Surveys are designed to enable researchers to data mine and obtain insights. Surveys have defects ranging from managers refusing to accept results to whether they are really effective in the first place. For example, I personally believe an organisation needs to talk and listen to its employees rather than using as survey. When subjected to a survey, the smart thing for an employee to do is to respond with civil delivery. While expressing dissatisfaction, you need to be careful to phrase your sentiments well knowing that they will be sent to your boss or could be leaked via social media but you will still be fine with it. That way, if your information leaks or is pinned against you, you can look someone straight in the eye and tell them it is constructive feedback and you were trying to help.Where you need to be careful is on personal opinions or comments where the issue can easily be identifiable. For instance, if you say there is a lot of sexual harassment in the department and the respondent is the only woman in the department, it will be obvious who said that. It’s also better to give negative feedback by keeping details about a specific person or personal situation to yourself and handle through other channels in the workplace if you feel you must.
