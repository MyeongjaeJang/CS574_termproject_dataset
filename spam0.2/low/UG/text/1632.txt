April 9, 2018 GRANDWINNERS_ The lucky punters that got team jerseys 
Work in Mbarara town got paralysed as Fortebet showered over 200 customers with the usual gifts that it gives out by way of saying ‘Thank you’. All customers that were found in all the three Fortebet centres which include; Ru Complex, Mbarara Main and Mbarara Alois got various gifts ranging from company wristbands, caps, T-shirts and team jerseys of the top European teams. Customers who had placed bet Shs 2000 and above went back to their homes ‘wearing Fortebet’. 
“Like we have done in other areas, we have come here to say thank you to you for choosing Fortebet. On top of thanking you, Fortebet has also brought you rewards for everyone” John Nanyumba, Fortebet Media manager said while speaking to the punters at Mbarara main branch before the gifts’ handover. He added, “We are not asking questions nor conducting a draw. Your only password to getting any of the gifts is just showing your betting slip.” On top of the above gifts, Fortebet also gave away footballs to young stars. The brand-new Fortebet-branded balls were given out to at Kakyeka Stadium and Mbarara high school playground. 
Nanyumba further noted that, “This exercise is not ending here. We have reached so many branches and we are going to reach all our branches countrywide. Even for the branches we have reached, we shall keep on coming back. All you need to do is checking our facebook page to know which branch shall get the gifts in the following weekend.” This weekend, ForteBet shall be at Ntinda, starting at midday, so be there and win!
