By Benjamin Gavara - April 17, 2018 ORGANISED PROTEST: Anselm Besigye, the only kid of FDC strongman Dr Kizza Besigye and his wife, Winnie Byanyima, the executive Director of Oxfam. 
Anselm Kizza Besigye, the 21-year old son of Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) stalwart Dr. Kizza Besigye and activist wife Winnie Byanyima, has organized a protest at Harvard University. 
The freshman allegedly led over 150 members of Black Law Student’s Association (BLSA) after the arrest of their colleague on Friday. 
“I am helping organize undergraduates’ collective response to the arrest of fellow student. I think the University should have done more to protect the student involved in the incident,” the younger Besigye said at the venue of the meeting held at the Law School’s Wasserstein Hall. 
The BLSA referred to the arrest as ‘police brutality’ against the black students and disagreed with the Cambridge police saying it was ‘incorrect’. 
However, Cambridge Police Department officers said the student was arrested after a physical encounter with law enforcement on charges including indecent exposure, assault and disorderly conduct. 
Meanwhile, Anselm Besigye says he does not feel safe at the Harvard campus. 
“As I’ve learned more about what has happened, it’s just become more obvious to me that there is an acute and systematic failure on almost every level of administration to secure black lives on this campus,” he reportedly said. 
“I don’t think the University does enough in general to protect its black students. I don’t feel safe on this campus ever. I don’t feel safe walking alone here,” the younger Besigye is quoted as further saying. 
Anselm Besigye is the only child to FDC former presidential candidate Dr. Besigye and Oxfam boss Winnie Byanyima.
