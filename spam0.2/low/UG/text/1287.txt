KAMPALA. The second edition of the Smack League is now water under the bridge as it climaxed on Sunday at the Makerere Rugby Grounds with season one champions, Devils, regaining the trophy despite going down 2-1 to the Mafias on the final day. 
With the Outkasts breathing down their necks, the Devils had to avoid defeat to keep their title. It was not the case as they would win it with a loss as Elites did them a favour by holding Outkasts 1-1. 
Devil`s Larry Agaba who emerged MVP of the eight months league credited his side`s success to the origination and discipline they have displayed since day one. 
"We have been organized and it has helped us remain consistent throughout the entire campaign," he told Daily Monitor. "Today`s celebrations are as a result of what we have been doing since the competition began. It was not easy to defend the title but we pulled through," he added. 
The league is expected to return bigger and better in season three with the Vikings almost confirmed as additions next campaign. The organizing committee is also increasing the number of sides in the competition from 16 to 20. 
The day also saw a Smack League select side beat Namilyango College old boys 4-2 in a game of two halves. Having gone down 3-0 after three quarters of the game, Namilyango fought back through Simon Wakabi`s brace to end it with a more respectable 4-2 score.
