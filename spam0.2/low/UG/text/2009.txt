In an effort to protect the health and safety of consumers and the environment, the Uganda National Bureau of Standards (UNBS) has gazetted 76 new compulsory standards, according to the latest issue of the Uganda Standards Gazette. The compulsory standards are part of the 254 standards approved by the National Standards Council (NSC), the governing body of UNBS, and recommended to the Minister of Trade, Industry and Cooperatives (MTIC), Amelia Kyambadde, for gazetting as compulsory standards in accordance with the UNBS Act. The UNBS Deputy Executive Director in charge of Standards, Patricia Bageine Ejalu said: “The compulsory standards are meant to guarantee quality of products and services to protect the health and safety of consumers and the environment and they are enforceable under the UNBS Act.” The compulsory standards include food and agriculture, engineering, oil and gas, management and services, chemicals and environment standards. Ms Ejalu said the standards will also enhance the development of Micro, Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (MSMEs), promote trade, improve livelihoods and foster export opportunities in Uganda. Standards are developed through Technical Committees composed of experts drawn from academia, government, industry, consumer groups and civil society. Technical Committees are responsible for recommending final draft Uganda Standards to the National Standards Council (NSC) for approval and declaration as Uganda Standards. Section 18 of the UNBS Act (Cap 327) provides that the NSC may recommend certain national standards for declaration as compulsory by the Minister responsible for Trade. Post Views: 73
