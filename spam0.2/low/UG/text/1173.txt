Uganda Police is set to examine the mental status of Kadu Herbert, who caused a scare at Namirembe Cathedral when he dashed with a club to the altar with with intention to clobber man of God, Bishop Wilberforce Luwalira. 
Police contends that Kadu aged 35 years, a resident of Makay Zone in Rubaga, came cruising in a Toyota Noah UAS 329T, clad in a back cloth and armed with a big stick. He beat police security at the cathedral and irrupted into church. 
However, while the congregation was unsuspectingly praying, Kadu sprinted in the aisle at break neck speed, and headed towards Luwalira who stood iced, clutching his crozier. 
Kadu however failed his target when he took a tumble at the altar and was apprehended by church security and well-wishers. 
“He is now being detained at Namirembe Police Post on charges of threatening violence under SD REF. 03/01/04/2018,” a statement from Police reads. 
“We are doing all it takes to find out his motives. However, sources allege insanity and hence the same is pending for a medical examination to determine his mental sanity. If proven insane is to be referred to a mental rehabilitation centre and if not not is to be charged criminally,” the statement continues.
