KAMPALA- American troops have carried out airstrikes in Somalia and killed three al Shabaab fighters in the southern town of Jilib, the headquarters of the militants. 
A Wednesday statement issued by the US Africa Command said the attack was carried out on Monday. 
“In coordination with the Federal Government of Somalia, U.S. forces conducted an airstrike against al-Shabaab militants on February 19, in the vicinity of Jilib, Somalia, killing three terrorists,” the statement reads in part. 
African Union troops have halted offensive operations against al Shabaab troops because of their thin presence in the war theatre. AMISOM also says the troops have no force multipliers, helicopters and infantry fighting vehicles. 
The statement says American troops will continue carrying out attacks against al Shabaab positions. It added: “U.S. forces will continue to use all authorised and appropriate measures to protect U.S. citizens and to disable terrorist threats. This includes partnering with AMISOM and Somali National Security Forces (SNSF) in combined counterterrorism operations and targeting terrorists, their training camps, and their safe havens throughout Somalia and the region.” advertisement
