Eleven Lions where on Thursday morning found dead at Hamkungu fishing village, a reserve of Queen Elizabeth National Park. The Uganda Wildlife Authority communications manager Bashir Hangi confirmed the unfortunate news. “It is true we lost a pride, three mothers and eight young ones that brings the total to 11 in a fishing village called Hamukungu. We are suspecting poisoning. The information we have is that they attacked someone’s cows” Hangi said. 
The deputy Executive Director Uganda Tourism Association ,Herbert Byaruhanga, described the incident as very unfortunate, noting that it is a big blow to the country’s tourism sector. He added: It will affect the tourism sector very much because lions are among the top animals that attract tourists into the area. The government should actually use force to get the people out or do not allow them to graze their animals in the park. - Advertisement -
