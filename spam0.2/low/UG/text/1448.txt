KAGADI. 
Residents of Rwabaranga in Mpeefu sub county, Kagadi district have rushed to health officials to report a strange disease which has claimed five people in a space of one week. Mr Anakereti Behangana Kyakabare a village health worker said: ‘‘It is surprising that five people have died in one village and we suspect it could be a strange disease that the health team should identify before it spreads to other areas given that Mpeefu is a neighbour to Ndaiga sub-county where the latest cholera outbreak is reported’’. Mr Peter Situma the Kagadi district health inspector who led a health team from Kagadi hospital on Wednesday explained that his office received a threatening phone call from a Village Health Team (VHT) member urgently requesting for immediate intervention as the deceased possessed signs and symptoms of cholera disease. Situma has urged residents to wash hands with soap always, properly use toilets, drink boiled water and avoid shaking hands. The Kagadi District Health Officer (DHO) James Olowo on Tuesday confirmed the cholera outbreak in Ndaiga Sub County Kagadi district after one person tested positive. advertisement
