March 20, 2018 campaigning aid for intellictual property rights 
The Uganda National Bureau of Standards and Uganda Registration Service Bureau have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to enforce standards and protect intellectual property rights in the country with the aim to foster creativity and job creation. The signing of the MOU on Tuesday in Kampala means the two institutions will work together to track local manufacturers and traders and sensitize the public on issues of concern. They will also share information and have a common position on matters of interest as well as have joint enforcement programs. Under the MOU URSB will ensure the public upholds compulsory standards before an application for a trademark can be granted. The MoU was signed by the Registrar General of URSB Bemanya Twebaze and the Executive Director UNBS, Dr. Ben Manyindo. During the signing ceremony, Mr. Bemanya Twebaze said that “this would result in a more sufficient and easily accessible service and a more visible coordination action from the government against counterfeits and substandard goods that will improve the environment of doing business in Uganda”. On the other hand, Dr. Ben Manyindo said that, “the synergies that will accrue from this cooperation will go a long way in protecting the consumers while protecting intellectual property rights of manufacturers.” UNBS is responsible for matters of Standardization, quality assurance, metrology and Testing while URSB is responsible for registration of Business names, companies and legal documents, Intellectual Property Rights (patents, trademarks, industrial designs and copyright). It also does civil registration such as registration of all marriages and conducts civil marriages. The Bureau also handles Insolvency matters. SHARE
