Why are there few men in places of worship? GMO orange In Summary The question is, if men are not always in church, where do they go? May be football, looking for money, or even engaging in illicit activities instead of going to church. Advertisement By Starin Musiimenta 
The biggest number in any church congregation are women. According to the 2014 Population Census, the total number of women in Uganda is 17.9 million while men are 16.9 million making a percentage of 51 per cent and 49 percent respectively. Interestingly, the number of men in worship places does not correspond with their national population number. 
While addressing representatives of the sponsors of children in Compassion International from Australia that had visited Nyakayojo Child Development Centre on April 10, 2018, Ankole bishop Dr Fred Sheldon Mwesigwa, said women are most active in church activities compared to men. He said during his pastoral visits, out of big number of people in a choir, only two can be men. 
He said this based on the choir of children who were presenting a Kinyankole traditional dance. In the dance team, there was a tall girl who acted as a wife of very short boy. When the bishop inquired why they chose a short boy to act as the tall girlsâ€™ husband, a teacher said the tall boys were shy. 
The question is, if men are not always in church, where do they go? May be football, looking for money, or even engaging in illicit activities instead of going to church. Church of Uganda has started Fathers Union and we thank them for trying to offer a solution to this problem. However, more needs to be done to make the union as vibrant as the Mothers Union.
