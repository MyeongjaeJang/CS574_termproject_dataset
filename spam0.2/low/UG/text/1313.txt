While receiving the bodies of UPDF at Entebbe Air Force Base on Tuesday, Maj Gen Kavuma said that, though it was unfortunate for UPDF to lose their comrades while fighting Alshabbab terrorists, 
‘ ‘what continues to give UPDF strength is the fact that “they didn’t die in vain, because they did a very good job resisting, precisely striking and destroying Alshabaab and its fighting equipment” he said. He also said that UPDF killed many Alshabaaab terrorists with the number continuing to rise and also either captured or destroyed their weapons . - Advertisement -
