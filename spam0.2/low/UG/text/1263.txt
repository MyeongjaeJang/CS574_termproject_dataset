Investors and officials on Monday commissioned the start of construction works in Busanza area of Kigali City’s Kicukiro District where new homes for what is popularly known as Bannyahe slum residents will be built. The project in Busanza where 1024 dwelling units will be built by Savannah Creek Development Company will benefit residents from Kigali’s largest slum locally known as Bannyahe that occupies three villages of Kangondo I, Kangondo II, and Kibiraro I in Gasabo District. 
While commissioning the project in Busanza, city businessman Denis Karera said that it will make a difference for slum residents who are currently living in a high risk area in unplanned settlements. Karera is the Chairperson of Gold Capital Investments, a Kigali-based company that has partnered with a Finnish company, Taaleri Africa, to create Savannah Creek Development Company. - Advertisement - 
The latter has planned to invest $56million to develop the slum into decent residential estates. Of the $56 million, $12 million will be invested in building housing units for former slum residents in exchange for their expropriated properties. Karera also said that the estate in Busanza will have important amenities for occupants such as playing areas, a modern market, a workshop hall for people to practice different crafts, as well as a central sewerage system. 
He said that the project will be completed in December 2018 and called for the cooperation of local residents and officials in Busanza to make the project a success. The slums in Bannyahe will be razed and replaced by modern residential estates in line with Kigali City’s Master plan that aims to build the city in a planned way. 
He said that the government has welcomed the project as it is likely to improve the lives of slum dwellers who will get decent amenities like markets and schools. Source: The New Times
