Russia shut down US consulate in St Petersburg and expels diplomats March 29, 2018 - Advertisement - 
Sergey Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, says Russia will close down the US consulate in St Petersburg. 
The move is a retaliation to the expulsion of Russian diplomats across the world following the poisoning of the Skripals. 
Russia says it will expel the same number of foreign diplomats as have been ejected from countries across the world. - Advertisement -
