Kampala , Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Disappointed by the news that Donald Trump had become president of the United States, a former Nike executive decided that ignorance truly is bliss, so he retreated into his pig farm in rural Ohio and completely cut himself off from all news. 
The last news that Erik Hagerman heard was that Donald Trump was the new president of the United States. 
That shook him so hard that he decided he just didn’t want to know anything about what was going on in America or the world, anymore. 
It was supposed to be a temporary “blockade”, but over a year since, Hagerman remains completely oblivious to what’s been going on around him. 
He claims that after paying attention to the news for decades with nothing to show for it, he now feels emotionally healthier than ever before. Share on:
