3,000 police officers deserted force in the last 03 years; continue to receive monthly salary   
Over 3,000 police officers have reportedly deserted the Uganda Police Force police in the last three years– according to the ongoing head count ordered by Inspector General of Police Okoth Ochola. Sources within police revealed that, mostly of the ‘deserters’ are from Field Force Unit (FFU), General Duties, Anti-Stock Theft Unit (ASTU), and Tourism Police. They reportedly abandoned the force between May 2014 and 2017. 
Unfortunately, the ‘missing’ officers continue to receive monthly pay. Deputy Police Spokesperson Patrick Onyango told journalists at the Central Police Station in Kampala Monday morning that these officers could be responsible for the high crime rates. - Advertisement - 
Onyango was not clear whether the errant officers left behind their uniforms and guns when fleeing. Units most affected by the desertion are Aviation Police, Crime Intelligence, Railway Police, and Counterterrorism with each of the units reportedly registering between 70 to 200 deserters. The headcount was ordered after claims several police officers were performing non police duties while others have absconded – although they continue to be paid salaries. 
The disappearance of officers was reportedly unearthed a fortnight ago after the Inspector General of Police ordered a head count of all officers at all police stations, units and directorates. 
Onyango warned that such officers would be prosecuted in criminal courts. Police have directed officers in charge of criminal investigations at all its 1,081 police station to work on files of all officers who have absconded for three weeks and more. A police officers is declared a deserter after disappearance from duty for 21 days which commonly known as Absent Without Leave.
