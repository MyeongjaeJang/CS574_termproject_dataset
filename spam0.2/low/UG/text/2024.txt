You can go ahead and fill your wardrobe with jeans. It is one of those trends that never goes out of style. More than ever, it is the clothing of choice for the busy, trendy individual. Moreover, depending on how you accessorise, jeans can be worn almost anywhere during any time of the day. 
“You can be worn at home, workplace or even while performing any other errand outside the house,” says Jov Mbabazi, a stylist. 
In addition, Mbabazi says jeans can be worn with almost any kind of vest, blouse or cardigan. Below, Martha Lydia Achen, a model, shows us what she often wears with her pair of jeans. 
All about those jeans 
A brief history Jeans are pants made from denim or dungaree cloth. They were invented by Jacob Davis and Levi Strauss in 1873. Strauss came from Germany to New York in 1851 to join his older brother who had a dry goods store. 
In 1853, he heard about the Gold Rush in the West, so, moved to San Francisco to establish the Western branch of the family dry good business. There he sold, among other things, cotton cloth. One of his customers was Jacob W. Davis, a tailor from Reno, Nevada. Davis made functional items such as tents, horse blankets, and wagon covers. 
One day, a customer ordered a pair of pants that could withstand hard work. He made them from denim that he bought from Levi Strauss & Co and made them stronger by placing copper rivets at the places pants rip the most: pockets and flies. Later, he wrote to Levi Strauss, and they became partners. They opened a bigger factory, and that is how jeans were born.
