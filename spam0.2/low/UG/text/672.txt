Karamoja and Busoga Sub-regions have been named as having the most fertile women.This was revealed on March 26 by the Director Social Economic Survey at Uganda Bureau of Statics (UBOS), James Muwonge, during a dissemination workshop of the house holder survey’s findings for 2016/2017, to stakeholders in Busoga. 
Mr Muwonge said the survey conducted by UBOS indicates that the women fertility rates in Karamoja and Busoga Sub-regions stand at 7 per cent and 6.1 per cent respectively which is ‘way above’ the national fertility rate of 5.4 per cent. 
He attributed the trend to active nutrients in the body and ignorance about family planning methods in the regions.Mr Muwonge however revealed that the high fertility rate among women results in poor health as the body is weakened as they produce many children. advertisement
