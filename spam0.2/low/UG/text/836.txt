Big League: Kitara facing must win tie against Water Advertisement By GEORGE KATONGOLE 
KAMPALA. 
Kitara head into today’s game away against Water in what promises a must-win for both sides.According to Kitara coach Tony Sekitto, a loss could put them out of the reckoning of the lone automatic promotion slot. Seven months ago, Kitara appeared on the brink of something special but are now in a precarious situation and a Water win will propel them into the third place currently occupied by Kitara themselves. Joint leaders Nyamityobora, who have built a three-point buffer over Kitara, can reclaim the top when they play eighth-placed Kireka at home where they are yet to lose.“Water is now in position to play in the play-offs and this could be a big game for us, but we’re just going to do all we can. For the moment, we’re just focused on promotion,” Sekitto said. Kitara may have experienced the bitter blow of being beaten comprehensively 3-0 on Sunday by Bumate but a third game in seven days will require something extra.
