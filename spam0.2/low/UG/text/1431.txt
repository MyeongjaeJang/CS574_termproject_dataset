“We expect this year’s edition to be more competitive and full to capacity because we have over 390 swimmers entering for this event,” Dolphins coach Tonnie Kasujja told Daily Monitor. “We are happy to make our own contribution to development of sport in the country. Swimming is moving places and most importantly, the young children are getting better at it.”
