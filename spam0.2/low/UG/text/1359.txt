KAMPALA. 
The Anti-Corruption Court in Kampala has acquitted a consultant on the deadly Ebola hemorrhagic fever of charges of corruption and abuse of office.Dr David Kaggwa, who was working at Kabarole Regional Referral Hospital, was accused of fraudulently receiving Shs580,000 and using government facilities to treat private patients at his previous work station in Kagadi.“…the circumstances under which Dr Kaggwa was carrying out the alleged services was voluntary as Kagadi at the time did not have doctors and he would come in on emergencies,” ruled Grade One Magistrate Peter Fred Lochomin. Dr Kaggwa was arrested in 2015, a year after working as part of a medical team that went to Liberia to offer expatriate services following one of the most deadly Ebola outbreaks in Africa in recent times. He was then granted bail on June 13, 2015, upon denying four counts, which included three of corruption and one of abuse of office. 
The rulingMagistrate Lochomin also said the evidence of paying for services at Kagadi Hospital remained unchallenged by the prosecution since it was normal for patients to be referred from Dr Kaggwa’s clinic to the main hospital for further management. Court also ordered that the Shs2m that Dr Kaggwa had deposited for bail be refunded and any clinical items that were confiscated and used as exhibits in the case all be returned.The prosecution had contended that between January and June 2013, Dr Kaggwa while at Kagadi Hospital in Kibaale District, used the hospital facilities to carry out surgeries on his private patients for personal gain to the disadvantage of his employer, which amounted to abuse of office.They had also said within the same months, Dr Kaggwa received Shs180,000 from Ms Juliet Tusemerirwe in order to carry out a surgical operation on her husband, Mr John Mitara. They had also claimed that Dr Kaggwa had allegedly received Shs250,000 from Ms Omuhereza Kebirungi and Shs150,000 from Mr Iddi Kyamanywa for surgical operations on their sons. advertisement
