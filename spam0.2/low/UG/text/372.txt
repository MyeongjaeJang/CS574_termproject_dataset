I lost my car key. Where can I get another? Advertisement 
Hello Paul, I own a Jeep Grand Cherokee 2007. I lost my key a few days ago, its the type with buttons to remotely open the doors. Can I buy a key from any spare parts shop in town and cut it to the car? Will it work? Kenneth Kampe. 
Hello Kenneth , your Jeep Grand Cherokee uses a programmable key with a remote key fob to open the doors and transponder unit for recognition by the Jeep security system. The car’s inbuilt security system recognises the programmed key and allows the engine control module to issue drive authorisation which enables you to start the car. The new key’s transponder has to be programmed by an authorised Jeep dealer, to be able to start your car. It might be prudent to visit the local Jeep dealer for advice especially because the key is a security issue. You want to buy your car key from a secure source. advertisement
