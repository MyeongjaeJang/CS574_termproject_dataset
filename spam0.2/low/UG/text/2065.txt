April 14, 2018 BIG ARSENAL FAN: NSSF Managing Director Richard Byarugaba 
Thousands of Arsenal FC fans in Uganda were yesterday brought back to life as the English Club came from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 with CSKA Moskav, in effect storming the semi-finals of the UEFA Europa League played in Russia. 
One of the fans who was mesmerized by the Arsenal comeback is none other than the Managing Director of the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), Richard Byarugaba, who had a stint in England. 
“When they (CSKA Moskav) scored two (goals), I knew we (Arsenal FC) were gone,” Byarugaba said as he chatted with a colleague while having breakfast during a corporate function at the Lake Victoria Hotel Serena, Kigo. 
His colleague interjected saying Arsenal FC fans in Uganda are the most enduring, given the poor performance of the club in the recent years. “I have always told ladies who are looking for husbands to go for Arsenal FC fans. They are the most enduring. I can’t handle that,” he said. 
Journalists who were around could not believe that Mr Byarugaba, who manages one of the largest pension funds in Africa, is a football fan. But anyway many learnt that Byarugaba enjoys sports and is the Corporate League patron. 
Nonetheless journalists have wished him good luck. “I wish him and his club Arsenal good luck,” a journalist said. 
Arsenal can only play in the UEFA Champions League next season if it wins the Europa Cup. Post Views: 86
