March 22, 2018 KACITA spokesperson Issa-Sekitto 
As leaders of African countries were meeting in Kigali to formally launch the African Continental Free Trade Area Treaty (AfCFTA) which will allow free movement of businessmen, Uganda’s traders under their umbrella body Kampala City Traders Association (KACITA) were also meeting discussing issues affecting them. 
Among the issues raised included exorbitant taxes, high rental fees and foreign petty traders. 
In a heated meeting at their offices in Kampala, it was pointed out that the three issues were the biggest constraints to business in Kampala, and gave government up to April 10 to address their concerns or hold a peaceful demonstration over what they called ‘unfavorable business environment’. 
KACITA spokesperson, Issa Ssekito said they were to march to the Prime Minister’s Office if their concerns are not addressed. 
Meanwhile, according to latest reports, the leadership of KACITA has been summoned for a meeting with the Prime Minister.
