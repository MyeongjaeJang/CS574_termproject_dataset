March 23, 2018 Police Deputy Spokesperson Patrick Onyango 
Police has refuted media reports that the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Okoth Ochola ordered for immediate closure of the notorious Nalufenya police detention centre. 
Deputy Police Spokesperson Patrick Onyango, the police advisory committee discussed about facility near the Source of the Nile in Jinja on Wednesday, but made no conclusive decision. 
‘The IGP normally writes his orders and directives, therefore this was not made, and in case the decision is taken then police will communicate via normal procedures,’ indicates a release by Superintendent of Police (SP) Onyango. 
The infamous Nalufenya detention facility is known for torture, its most prominent victim being the Kamwenge Mayor Godfrey Byamukama who was arrested in relation to the assassination of the Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIGP) Andrew Felix Kaweesi on March 17, 2017. 
Also, several other prominent people have been detained in Nalufenya including opposition icon Dr. Kizza Besigye and Rwenzururu King Charles Wesley Mumbere and most recent police officer, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Muhammad Kirumira. 
Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) commander Jamil Mukulu is also incarcerated at the detention facility.
