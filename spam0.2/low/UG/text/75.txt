Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Equity Bank Uganda in partnership with the United Nations Capital Development Fund has intensified its drive for financial inclusion in Uganda by unveiling a new program called Mobile Money for the Poor (MM4P) that will ride on agency banking targeting refugees. 
The two partners recently showcased the technology, process and applicability of this solution at the Kampala Serena Hotel. 
The product that is already working in other East African Community Countries uses biometric card solutions to secure electronic cash transfer from donors and other well wishers to refugees. 
The bank’s Executive Director, Anthony Kituuka, said refugees would benefit from the program by borrowing a leaf from markets like Kenya where a program – the National Hunger Safety Net with 420,000 beneficiaries have so far received Ksh4.79bn. Uganda has about one million refugees mainly from South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Share on:
