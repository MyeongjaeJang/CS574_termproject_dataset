I recently got a cervical cancer injection but when my sister went for the same, she was told it is for virgin girls aged between nine and 13. Will I be affected since I am 26 and not a virgin? Jane 
Dear Jane,Although most cervical cancers are caused by an infection caused by Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), there are other rare types of cervical cancer that are not caused by HPV. However, prevention of the majority of cervical cancers involves among others things, HPV vaccination.HPV that causes cervical cancer is sexually transmitted and girls between nine and 13 years who are usually virgins should be immunised since then they will not have already been infected with the HPV virus. Immunising a girl who is already infected is not useful. 
It is advised that at 26 years when one is not a virgin, instead of giving HPV vaccination when a woman may already be having the virus, PAP smears are done to screen against cancer of the cervix.However, some women, if they are checked and found not to have HPV infection even when they are 26 years, virgins or not, may get immunised against the virus if they so wish, or as advised by their doctor. advertisement
