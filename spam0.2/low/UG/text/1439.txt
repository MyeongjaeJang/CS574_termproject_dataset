April 6, 2018 Rwanda High Commissioner Major General Frank Mugambage addressing journalists today 
The Rwanda High Commission has revealed that the construction of genocide memorial sites in Mpigi, Masaka and Kasensero, at areas in Uganda where bodies of some of the 1994 Genocide victims were found. 
According to the Rwanda High Commissioner Maj. Gen. (Rtd) Frank Mugambage, the archiving of the 1994 Rwandan genocide is also to begin after his country received over $10,000 from various ‘friends of Rwanda’ toward that cause. 
“Upon construction, we aim at registering them with United Nations Education and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) for recognition and attraction of tourists from various countries,” Maj Gen Mugambage said while addressing journalists ahead of the 24 th commemoration of 1994 Genocide that begins tomorrow, April 7. 
The High Commissioner also noted that the government led by Paul Kagame has since 1994 endeavored to unite, reconcile and reconstruct the country. “Genocide is a threat to humanity, and we should fight against it,” Maj Gen Mugambage said, adding that over one million Rwandan nationals perished in the 100-day orgy. 
“Therefore, we commemorate, mourn and reflect on the inhuman acts that were committed against the Tutsi, Hutu, among other tribes in Rwanda,” Maj Gen Mugambage added. 
He also noted that the country is working hard to try suspects who engaged themselves in the killings. “When we establish a suspect in any country, we collaborate so that he or she is extradited for trial,” he added. 
In Uganda the 24 th Genocide commemoration will start tomorrow with public lectures and climax a week later with laying of wreaths at the different burial sites in Mpigi, Masaka and Kasensero.
