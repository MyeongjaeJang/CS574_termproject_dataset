Museveni pays last respect to South Africa’s Winnie Mandela; says she was indispensable   
President Museveni has paid tribute to South African anti-apartheid campaigner Winnie-Madikizela Mandela, eulogising that her as having filled an “indispensable gap” in the fight against apartheid in South Africa. 
Mr Museveni on Tuesday signed a condolence book at the South African High Commission in Kampala and eulogised Winnie Mandela as a “face” of the African National Congress, the party that championed the struggle against white minority rule. ‘‘Winnie Mandela filled an indispensable gap for the struggle of our people in S. Africa. And all this, minus any prior preparation for this role. It is for this reason that I had to go to the high commission and condole with South Africans and Africa. May her soul rest in peace.’’ The president said. - Advertisement - 
Mr. Museveni said the late Winnie Mandela was the face of the struggle until the early 70s when other faces began to appear to support the cause. The likes of Steve Biko, COSATU and then the 1976 Soweto student uprising. ‘‘When Mandela would appear in pictures, he had this beautiful young lady beside him. When he was imprisoned, this young lady became the face of the African National Congress. She had her own fair share of arrests, detentions and confinement.’’ He added. 
Winnie Mandela, 81, the former wife of South Africa’s first black president Nelson Mandela was, along with her husband, an enduring figure in the resistance against white-minority rule. She died on April 2 in Johannesburg after a long-term illness. - Advertisement -
