Two people have been shot and injured by the UPDF soldiers attached to Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) in an operation to impound motorcycles without license plates.The incident started Wednesday morning when an angry mob engaged the URA enforcement officers after one of the boda-boda cyclists, died as he was hit by a door of the URA car in the process of impounding his motorcycle.Eye witnesses say the mob started their plans on Tuesday night after learning of the death of the boda-boda cyclist, who’s yet to be identified. All major roads from Yumbe-Arua and Yumbe-Moyo road have been barricaded as the gun shots continue to be fired. 
The Regional Police Commander North West Nile, Mr Ignatious Otong told Daily Monitor on phone that: “This is a problem that came between the revenue officers as they impounded motorcycles of boda-boda men. But I do not have any information of people shot dead but we are still battling them. We shall update you of any information.” In 2009, two suspected smugglers were shot dead by URA Law Enforcement Officers in Koboko town. This also led to a protest in which a police car was burnt by the locals who overpowered the policemen when they attacked the police station. 
In 2010, the URA enforcement officers also shot a suspected smuggler in Maracha town. The boda-boda cyclists and some district leaders have always criticized the brutal methods used by the URA law enforcement officers in the process of impounding motorcycles or smugglers’ goods especially along Uganda-DR Congo borders.
