KAMPALA. The start of the 2018 Jazz Safari National Cricket League on Sunday only mirrored the happenings of 2017. 
Reigning champions Aziz Damani and last season’s runners-up Tornado Bee will be contenders, at least going by their respective 70-run and nine-wicket victories over Strikers and Premier in Kyambogo and Lugogo. 
The wins came on the back of good knocks of 113 off 122 balls by Dauda Rajani and 87* runs off 56 balls by Roger Mukasa in turn. 
On the other hand, KICC will have to beat the ceiling of mediocrity to match its own feeling of a potent club. Their five-wicket loss to Challengers, after only setting 89 runs in 24.3 overs in Entebbe, keeps them far from their first league title in two decades. 
Even if its title-winning run from 2013 ended last year, Tornado Bee played with an aura of invincibility against Division Two champions Premier. 
“This is to welcome Premier to the table of men,” said Tornado Bee captain Jeremy Kibuukamusoke.
