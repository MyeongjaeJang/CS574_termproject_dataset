KAMPALA. 
There is little from the inaugural edition last year that has been repeated at this year’s Entebbe Singleton Golf Challenge.The 2017 winning pairing of John Muchiri and Isaac Mariera was eliminated at the first round.And now new faces will head to World Golf Tour Championships at the luxurious Jumeriah Golf Estates in Dubai, UAE from November 15-18.That lucrative trip by RwandAir is the top prize for the winning pair of this knock-out showpiece this year.Now only eight pairings are left in the fray after they were trimmed from 16 in the Singleton third round at the par-71 course on Saturday.At this stage in 2017, the last standing female pairing of Irene Nakalembe and Moureen Okura was beaten by Allan Muhereza and Moses Mastiko at the last 16. A year later, Nakalembe in a new partnership with Eva Magala are into the quarterfinals having beaten Joseph Bogera and Charles Hamya 1-up on the par-4 18 green. 
Tough match “It was a tough match,” reacted Magala during the magnificent prize giving ceremony at the 19th hole punctuated by the ‘Oldies Night’ theme. “My partner Irene was not feeling her ‘A’ game the entire week. Even on course, she struggled but she gave me confidence and we worked together to win.”The record Entebbe Ladies Open champion Nakalembe struggled to putt and chip but she worked well with Magala to lead 2-up after Hole No.2. That was halved by Hamya and Bogera at the par-4 No.9 thanks to the latter’s straight drives. They levelled matters later and the ladies were only relieved on the final hole.Another second female pairing of Sheila Kesiime and Peace Kabasweka stunned Joseph Galiwango and Ali Juuko 3-up with two holes to spare (3/2).But the biggest winners of the day were the pairing of Muhereza and Michael Tumusiime who defeated Dan Kajungu and Collins Nuwagira 5/4 on the par-4 Hole No.14.
