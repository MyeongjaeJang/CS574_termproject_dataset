March 28, 2018 Reverend Isaac Bakka and his co-accused in court 
The trial of veteran journalist Reverend Isaac Bakka has failed to kick off because the case file is incomplete. 
Bakka and his three co- accused are charged with treason and have today appeared Wednesday before Nakawa Court Chief Magistrate Jamson Karemani for mention of the case, which failed to proceed. 
State Prosecutor Ann Ntimba informed court that police inquiries are ongoing, and Karemani further remanded the accused to Luzira upper prison as police continues investigations. 
The 68 year-old Bakka, a journalist working with BTN and Nile FM in Gulu, was allegedly kidnapped in January this year at a taxi stage in Mukono by unknown people. 
Following a long search by his family members, friends and intervention of parliament and public pressure, security agencies later admitted to having picked up Bakka. 
They subsequently took him to Nakawa court where he was charged with treason and remanded to Luzira prison. 
Prosecution states that Bakka, a former Chaplain in Uganda Army under President Iddi Amin, connived with a one Godfrey Asea, George Ngungu and Innocent Mawe to contrive a plot to overthrow the government of Uganda between January 2017 and January 2018 within various districts in Uganda and in other countries such as Kenya and South Sudan. 
This was allegedly through making utterances, acquisition of firearms and recruitment of individuals into armed forces. 
The case has now been adjourned to the April 11, 2018.
