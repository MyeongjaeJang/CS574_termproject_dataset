He said, “Im going to give every one of you pastors an opportunity to repent tonight. “And then to go back immediately after this convention and restitue your ways with your congregation “Make it clear to them anyone who is not paying his tithe is not going heaven, full stop.“ 
Pastor Adeboye, who heads the Redeemed Christian Church of God – one of the biggest churches in Nigeria – has been listed by Forbes as one of the richest clerics in the world with a net worth of $130m. However, last year, Pastor Tunde Bakare told the BBC Yoruba service that the practice of tithing should not be compulsory. 
According to BBC, Giving tithes is a controversial topic in Nigeria and many churches compel members of their congregations to tithe, even though many people cannot afford to do so. It is estimated that 80% of Nigerians live on less than $2 a day.
