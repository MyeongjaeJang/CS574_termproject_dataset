Tweet Music sensation Janeth – Prischa 
Northern Uganda’s sensational singer, Jenneth Prischa, has been nominated for the prestigious Viga Music Awards. The awards are Uganda’s leading Gospel music festival. 
This was revealed during the nominee’s grand party held at the Ugandan Nation Theatre last Sunday, where Prischa’s song , PeApore single, hit song emerged on top of the list in the regional Song/Artiste of the Year. “I will be representing Northern Uganda and contesting with other regional artists like Peace Mbabazi K [from western Uganda], with her song, Empologoma ya Yuda , Busia Stars with Ebibaso and Bolingo Nangai by Mike Nimweze [all from Eastern Uganda], respectively,” said Prischa. 
She was so excited about her song making it to the final because it is a big inspiration to her musical talent in helping nourish souls. “As I prepare for this new move into the Gospel genre, I have written a couple of songs like, Take me home, What Will I do, Mony Polo and Tin Awoto, which I expect to release during the course of the year,” she said. 
Prischa revealed that her grand entry into the gospel music arena comes after several of her loyal fans requested her to reconsider singing for them some Gospel songs since they very much admired her voice and message as demonstrated in some of her top circular songs. “This is God’s calling through his people. Northern Uganda comes of age as regards to quality music production and promotion. I am glad to be part of this development as we glorify our Lord,” she added.
