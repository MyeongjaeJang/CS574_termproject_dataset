Why does my car delay to start? Advertisement By Paul Kaganzi 
Hi Paul, I have had trouble starting my Prado petrol for about two months now. A mechanic replaced the fuel pump, spark plugs and other parts and all was okay. What could be the trouble? Sam Mwandha. 
Hello Sam, has your technician run a computer diagnosis to check whether the engine has an electrical fault causing the cold start difficulty? There are electronic components in your Toyota engine such as the crank shaft position sensor, coolant temperature sensor or throttle position sensor that can cause starting difficulties if they are faulty. A computer diagnosis will help to rule them out. It would be good to request your mechanic for a written defect and repair report indicating clearly what he repaired so that you are not left guessing. Repair history serves as useful case notes when following up on a persistent fault or trying to get a second opinion. advertisement
