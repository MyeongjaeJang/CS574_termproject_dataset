Kampala. 
Kampala minister Beti Kamya has described as “mere propaganda” suggestions that the government is in the process of altering Kampala City boundaries to incorporate the surrounding Mukono, Mpigi and Wakiso districts.Ms Kamya told Daily Monitor in an interview on Wednesday that Ugandans should separate facts from propaganda.“There is no plan to expand boundaries of Kampala to the districts of Mukono, Mpigi and Wakiso and I have never attended any meeting that discussed such. I can say I have never heard of this anywhere,” she said.The minister’s explanation comes in the wake of accusations by some politicians hailing from the metropolitan area to the effect that Minister Kamya was orchestrating a move to expand Kampala beyond the current boundaries.The tensions intensified after Prime Minister Ruhakana Rugunda launched the Greater Kampala Economic Development and Job Creation Strategy on March 9, which some political leaders said was aimed at extending the capital city. 
Basis The study, commissioned last year by Kampala Mayor Erias Lukwago, was jointly conducted by the government and the World Bank. Under the strategy, the government seeks to emphasise planned urbanisation with special focus on the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area (GKMA).One of the vocal leaders on the matter is Mukono Municipality MP Betty Nambooze who last week accused Ms Kamya of being used by President Museveni to front an agenda aimed at defeating the Opposition in the metropolitan area.Ms Nambooze said the plan for GKMA and the proposed amendment of the KCCA Act 2010 are plans by government to force Greater Kampala “down our throats”.On Tuesday, the Minister without Portfolio, Hajj Abdul Nadduli, weighed in on the debate, saying what Ms Kamya is doing is equivalent to what former President Milton Obote did; amending the Constitution without consultation.However, Ms Kamya told this newspaper that the politicians have mistaken the GKMA physical development strategy hatched by the National Development Authority (NPA) as a move to expand the capital city.“The plan these people are being confused about was hatched by NPA, an agency that has the mandate to plan for the development of this country. NPA hatched plans for development strategies for the metropolitan areas through job creation in fulfilment of Vision 2040,” she said.She said the metropolitan development plans benchmarked on job creation strategies and economic development are supposed to be jointly executed by KCCA, Mukono, Mpigi and Wakiso districts under the stewardship of the Metropolitan Physical Planning Authority (MPPA).The minister said despite the MPPA board being appointed by her predecessor, Mr Frank Tumwebaze, it has never been functional because the KCCA Act is silent on the establishment of its secretariat. 
Implications Ms Kamya also revealed that the country is likely to miss out on the $600m grant from World Bank as a result of “those politicising the metropolitan development strategies as a way of expanding Kampala”.“Anybody calling this a bad plan and wanting to politicise it does not wish good for the people of Uganda because the World Bank may easily pull out of the arrangement and we lose this chance of a grant,” she warned.Ms Kamya explained that 3.5 million spend their day in Kampala business district, which she said causes a lot of congestion hence a need by NPA to plan for the metropolitan area as a way of decongesting the city.She said her ministry is pushing for is the creation of an institutional framework to ensure that such planning is implemented jointly by KCCA and the metropolitan local governments to develop a strategy for the entire GKMA. “We are saying let other services and infrastructure developments be extended to the metropolitan areas so that people cannot keep coming to the city to look for such services,” she said. advertisement
