KAMPALA. 
Seven Belgian water polo players are in Uganda to continue with the work of their colleague Gram Gil in the development of the sport. Due to Gil’s positive influence, Uganda partly owes the progress of the game to Belgium. Altona coach Erick Kisero and Gil, who has over 14 years experience playing the game, have been getting their fellow coaches and players acquainted with the sport since August 2017 while former South Africa national team coach Brad Rowe also held a water polo clinic here in December. All that work will be put to test during today’s games with the Belgians and during an exhibition at tomorrow’s Uganda Swimming Federation (USF) National Secondary Schools Gala - both events will be held at Green Hill Academy, Kibuli.The aim is to initiate local players into the playing environment as the newly introduced aquatic sport continues to grow ahead of the National Championships in July.“They are going to show us basics of the game and then we will mix them up with our players for a game or two,” Erick Kisero, who works with Gil to asesss the development of the sport, told Daily Monitor. advertisement
