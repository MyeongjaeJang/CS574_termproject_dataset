West Buganda Bishop Henry Katumba Tamale, has prayed that President Museveni, politicians and leaders get saved so as to make divinely guided decisions which do not hurt people. 
Bishop Katumba made the remarks at Kako Senior Secondary school where he was presiding over a thanks giving service for the good results in the 2017 exams. 
He noted that when leaders are not born again, they make decisions which are not good for the citizens and render them to suffer. 
"I hear that the president was once a born again but he needs to come back to God by proclaiming salvation. This will help him get God's guidance in whatever he does," the bishop said. 
In his sermon he also advised students not focus on academic excellence but to also consider spiritual and moral excellence as this will equip them with skills to fit in the highly competitive job market. 
"Aim at attaining skills through informal education because we have seen many graduates who are engaging in jobs which they did not train for because they are multi skilled," Bishop Katumba stressed. 
According to him, excelling in academic life without spiritual and moral success amounts to failure. 
He thus urged teachers not to only focus on making learners get first grades but also equip them with practical skills they need to survive in this world. advertisement
