Kiryandongo. 
President Museveni has dismissed as irrelevant calls by residents of Kiryandongo District that some foreign investors had displaced and left them homeless.Instead, Mr Museveni apologised to investors for the inconveniences Ugandans have caused them.Kiryandongo Woman Member of Parliament Hellen Kahunde had brought to the attention of Mr Museveni challenges she said are faced by her constituents. “We have the sugar-related kind of investors; they have displaced thousands of Ugandans and have caused a lot of pain in the hearts of the people of Kiryandongo,” Ms Kahunde told the President during the commissioning of a 180-bed hospital on Wednesday. The hospital was built by Restoration Gateway investors.The MP also told Mr Museveni that residents who had been on “their” land for more than 50 to 70 years were displaced by the so-called investors.“I’m not afraid to tell you that some of these investors are guided and protected by people in armed uniforms and they have guns and you know what it means,” Ms Kahunde said. But in response, President Museveni said: “We are here to celebrate the achievement of the Restoration Gateway project. We cannot talk about the other issues because we do not have enough time...In an examination, when you bring an issue which may be correct but not relevant.they say off point.”Dr Tim McCall is the executive director of Restoration Gateway.“They [investors] came and started this project here [in Kiryandongo]. It is centered around healthcare, education and also capacity building,” the President said.Mr Museveni asked the investors to forgive Ugandans for the pain the natives caused them while implementing their redevelopment activities. advertisement
