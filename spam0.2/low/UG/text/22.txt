Rhinos pounce to keep Pirates waiting Advertisement By Deus Bugembe 
Kampala. 
All the pomp Buzz Pirates had come with into their championship game in the Nile Special Premiership against on form Shell Rimula Rhinos was watered down as the latter pulled of a 3-0 win to keep the Sea Robbers waiting for another week.Pirates needed a win to start the celebrations but Rhinos were not ready to be the side that gives away the title like captain Ivan Markmot had suggested during the week. “They have played well this term and probably deserve it but we don’t want to be that side that gives it away with more games to play and we can only do that by beating them,” he told Daily Monitor last week.That message surely stuck in his teammates’ heads as a number of individuals turned on sizzling performances. It was had to choose the top performer for there were many but Cameroonian born Martial Tchumkam stood out both in attack and defence. “I felt I had let down my teammates when I left to check on my sick father in Cameroon and today’s game provided the best chance to repay the faith they have kept in me,” noted the affable prop.A sole Marmot penalty late on in the second half was the game’s difference and Rhinos held on even when Pirates threatened to respond in the dying moments. Pirates can still wrap up their maiden league title when they visit Jinja Hippos on Saturday.
