KAYUNGA. 
Residents of Kayunga Town, Kayunga District, have asked authorities in the area to close the district abattoir over poor hygiene.The Ministry of Agriculture constructed the abattoir in Bukolooto Trading Centre in 2009. It serves Kayunga District and parts of Mukono District.Mr Sam Kalule, a resident of Bukolooto, said the abattoir stinks due to uncollected animal dung.“We are about to abandon our homes due to the stench that the abattoir emits,” Mr Kalule said. “We have informed authorities about this problem several times, but they have turned a deaf ear,” he said.Ms Christine Kakidde, another resident, said they want the abattoir closed until the hygiene issue is sorted out. 
Smelly When this reporter visited the area last Friday, the place was smelly because of the uncollected dung and pools of blood that amass in the potholes on the slaughterhouse floor.The Kayunga Town clerk, Ms Margaret Nansubuga, said the poor hygiene at the slaughterhouse was as a result of the blockage in the pipe that takes the waste from the abattoir to the faecal sludge. 
Fixed “We have since fixed the pipe, but the problem now is that people at the abattoir use little water while washing offals, which makes the pipes to block continuously. Besides, they don’t clean the entire place properly with enough water,” Ms Nansubuga said.She, however, said they (council) will address the issue. 
Renovation The Kayunga Town health inspector, Mr Dan Eberu, said the abattoir needs renovation to stop blood from collecting in the potholed floor.“We are mobilising funds to ensure the renovation works are done. The problem has been worsened by the current rains, which make blood and dung to smell,” he said. advertisement
