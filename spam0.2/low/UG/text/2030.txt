Efforts by the Democratic Party (DP) to have their own home have been thwarted by encroachers on a piece of land the oldest party in Uganda had acquired.The land in Rubaga Division, off Kabaka Anjagala Road, which initially belonged to Mengo teachers, was purchased in 2001 by the DP leadership then under Dr Kawanga Ssemogerere and late Ssebaana Kizito, and the DP parliamentary caucus.In 2016, DP revived plans for the construction of a mega party headquarters blockers following 60 years of existence without one. Then Party national chairman, Mr Mohammed Baswaale Kezaala, said DP purchased the land at Shs19 million.He said the party has set aside Shs460 million for the first phase of the building (ground floor), which will be named after the party founder Benedict Kiwanuka.In 2004, DP made payments on the said land to a teacher’s Sacco in Mengo but Shs2 million remained unpaid. The debt, that later accumulated to Shs10 million, is said to have been cleared by Mr Damiano Lubega, a senior party member.Talking to Saturday Monitor, the DP secretary general, Mr Gerald Siranda, said after completing the payments required, the land was transferred from the teachers’ Sacco to DP as a party .He said their neighbour, Mengo Parkyard, managed under Mr Hussein Zake Mukasa, encroached on the piece of land.He added that Mr Zaake was proposing that they swap the land and relocate to Busega which the DP management rejected because Rubaga is their historical home.Mr Zaake said one month back, he received claims that he had encroached on DP land with his perimeter wall which he says was there before buying that land.“Before, DP did not have the land title and they got it in 2017. Since then, they started claiming that we encroached on their land and I asked them to do some investigation before jumping to such a conclusion,” Mr Zaake said.He added that both parties agreed to have surveyors and reported that the piece of land was negligible and does not warrant demolishing a property worth millions.“I have invested Shs25 million in the perimeter wall and I would not like it to be demolished. On that same side, there is a water reserve tank which is worth Shs50 million,” Mr Zaake said. advertisement
