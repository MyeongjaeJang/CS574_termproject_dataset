Kenya’s Ol Pejeta Conservancy has confirmed the death of the world’s only remaining male Northern White Rhino which died yesterday, leaving only two females of the doomed subspecies alive. 
The Conservancy said in a statement that it decided to euthanize the 45-year-old rhino, named Sudan, due to untreatable and debilitating health problems. 
‘The rhino suffered from health complications which affected his muscles and bones, resulting in extensive skin wounds’, part of the statement said. 
According to the statement, the rhino’s health condition worsened significantly in the last 24 hours and was unable to stand up and was suffering a great deal. 
The rhino (Sudan) is said to have refused to mate naturally with females, forcing conservationists to put it on the dating app Tinder, in a last-bid to raise US$ 9m for fertility treatment.
