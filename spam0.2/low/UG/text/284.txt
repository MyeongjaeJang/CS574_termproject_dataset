Mutajjazi Boxing Club disown UBF boss Muhangi Advertisement 
KAMPALA. 
The political disturbance in the administration of amateur boxing is not about to end.Hardly a month after High Court endorsed Moses Muhangi as the legitimately elected president of the Uganda Boxing Federation (UBF), Muhangi is being labelled an impostor by the very club that backed his candidature.Daily Monitor got a copy of a document sent to the National Council of Sports by Orima & Co. Advocates on behalf of Kibuli Mutajjazi Boxing Club in which the aforementioned club asserts “that Mr Muhangi is not a member of the club and therefore his nomination for the UBF presidency was unlawful, inoperative and illegal for want of compliance with articles 5, 6, 7, and 9 of the clubs’ Constitution and articles 13(4) of the UBF Constitution.”The letter, dated March 19, seeks to implore NCS to exercise its supervisory roles and declare Muhangi’s election as UBF president null and void “in not later than seven working days, beyond which we shall file appropriate action in a Court of Law.”Eddie Ssekitoleko, the club chairman, confirmed the allegations and faulted Fred Kavuma, their publicity secretary for illegally endorsing Muhangi without the club’s consent.“We don’t know Muhangi, he is not our member and we have called to meet him he has refused,” Ssekitoleko told us on phone. “Kavuma endorsed him without our consent. That’s why we are suing both of them.”Matter of fact, Muhangi is new to boxing, one of the reasons former president Kenneth Gimugu petitioned court contesting Muhangi’s presidency. However, Muhangi did not pick our calls.Meanwhile, there are reports of a bitter power struggle between Muhangi and his administrative deputy Kavuma—who seconded him to the presidency. advertisement
