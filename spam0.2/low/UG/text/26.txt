Are receptionists aware they are face of organisations Advertisement By Concerned Citizen 
I want to make observations about a corporate setting and how receptionists relate with other staff and people who interface with the organisation. 
I get puzzled how one goes to office with anger and starts being abusive to those who want their services. Are receptionists a bunch of tired people? These are questions that want answers. 
We see and talk about this everywhere, but we are still surprised when receptionists disrespect others. It bothers me to be welcomed in a rude way by a receptionist. A receptionist should be the mirror of the company where she works. 
A receptionist means a lot to the clients and fellow staff members. They should be warm, bright and welcoming. A receptionist with proper ethics means is what organisations want. 
They are the first people and sometimes the only ones that people contact when dealing with the organiation. Therefore, how a receptionist relates with people matters a lot. How people enter and leave the office building should be a concern for any organisation. It takes very little time to destroy another personâ€™s day. 
Being offensive to others in an office setting is one of the worst forms of public humiliation. 
Managing such a receptionist may not be easy. However, it is possible to help them change their ways, for instance, through training. Concerned Citizen,
