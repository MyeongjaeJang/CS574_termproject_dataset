"As the owner of the house, we appreciate that you should protect the rights of the tenant and your rights should also be protected," he saidFor the last 10 years, the Bill has been gathering, leaving the tenants at the mercy of landlords who charge exorbitant rents fees.In February, the leadership of Kampala City Traders Association (Kacita), asked government to approve the bill seeking to regulate the relationship between a landlord and a tenant. 
They said the bill should be passed without any further delay.“We have written to the Prime Minister notifying him that by March 15, if the bill is not tabled, we will have a massive demonstration to express our dissatisfaction,” Kacita chairman, Mr Everest Kayondo told journalists on February 13.Among other things, the bill seeks to introduce a tribunal that will settle agreements arising from disagreement of the two parties. The bill also wants tenancy agreement between the two parties to be mandatory by law. 
At the moment, most tenants are not able to accrue tax benefits arising from the rental expenditure because landlords are non-committal when it comes to issuance of rental receipts.Critics of the bill, among them Mr Phillip Karugaba, a lawyer, argues that the draft Landlord and Tenant Bill can only have a dampening effect on the private sector efforts to bridge the housing deficit, currently at 1.7 million units, with Kampala alone having a housing deficit of 550,000 units. advertisement
