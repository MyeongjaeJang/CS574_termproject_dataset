Seguya backs Mugerwa for Cranes captaincy Robert Seguya Advertisement By DEUS BUGEMBE 
KAMPALA. With the Rugby Cranes international season fast approaching, coach Robert Seguya has geared up the preps with a shake up in the side’s top hierachy.Kabras Sugar front row Asuman Mugerwa has been named new captain with wing Justin Kimono as his vice. The changes have been rang as a result of Mugerwa’s predecessor since 2014, Brian Odongo, undergoing surgery on his knee that will see him miss the season. 
“Odongo is out on medication and it may take him some good time before full recovery yet the team needs leadership,” said Seguya.Seguya has also praised Mugerwa as someone with an idea of what it takes to lead and ready to do it from the front. “I need someone who will lead the side as the rest look up to him and he has it all,” the former flanker told this paper. 
Leadership skills Kimono was also named Odongo’s vice in Peter Magona’s reign but the former got limited chances as a knee injury kept him out for two years. Having recovered last year and won some minutes in national colours, Kimono gets the chance to exercise his leadership skills. “They are devoted, committed and respect everyone without compromising the vision of the team,” added Seguya. 
National team training has now taken center stage with the league done and dusted. Seguya will have his troops test themselves against the South African Barbarians this month on April 28 and 30. “We have a plan that involves both international and local camps with build-up games,” explained Seguya on how Uganda plans to attempt qualification for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Uganda will compete against Zimbabwe, Morocco, Kenya, Namibia and Tunisia in the Gold Cup with a single World Cup spot at stake starting in June.
