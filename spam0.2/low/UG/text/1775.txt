Kalangala ferry good for promoting local tourism Advertisement By Ben Ssebuguzi 
Time check is 9.45am and the whole team is at Bukakata landing site to board a ferry to Kalangala for an introduction ceremony. Many of us were excited because it is our first time to not only use a ferry, but also travel on water. A well built water vessel is already docked at the landing site and by 9.30am, cars and bikes are brought in before people board just to minimise accidents. A smartly dressed ferry team helps people to board. 
At 10am, the entrance is closed and the ferry sets on its journey to Kalangala. I am told that this is its second route because the first one is at 8am, then another at 10am, 2pm and the last one is in the evening - all for free, courtesy of the government, which contributes Shs5b annually in partnership with Kalangala Infrastructural Service Ltd, a company that manages the ferry. 
Why write now is to express my appreciation to the company that manages this transport for its efficiency and goodwill in this public and private partnership to provide transport service to the islanders and others. At first, I thought I had to pay Shs10,000, but I was amazed to be told that the service is free. The ferry is well fitted with fire extinguishers, life jackets and a team of professionals, who can rescue people in case of an accident. Everyone is assured of the seat and the public is given safety tips on the ferry.Keep serving Ugandans diligently and promoting tourism on Sese islands. Ben Ssebuguzi ,
