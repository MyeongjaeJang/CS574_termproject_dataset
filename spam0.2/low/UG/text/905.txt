D/ Attorney General Rutaana now wonders whether Lawyer Mabirizi is ‘fit, sound and proper Person’ March 29, 2018 - Advertisement - 
Deputy attorney General Hon. Mwesigwa Rutaana had described city lawyer Male Mabirizi Kiwanuka’s claims that he sired a child with Justice Elizabeth Musoke as ‘ ‘false, malicious, unfounded and defamatory’’ Mr. Rukutaana notes a 29th March 2018 letter to the Deputy Chief Justice Owiny Dollo. He was responding to a letter by Male Kiwanuka Mabirizi, one of the petitioners challenging age limit bill. 
The petition is set to be heard on 8th April 2018 by the Constitutional Court. Justice Owiny Dollo will head a panel of judges who include justices Remmy Kasule, Elizabeth Musoke, Kenneth Kakuru and Cheborion Barishaki. Mr Mabirizi, however, objects Justice Musoke’s involvement in the case arguing that she would be involved in her own case since she sired a child with among others Mwesigwa Rukutana, who is heading the government’s legal team. - Advertisement -

Mr Mabirizi further reasoned that Justice Musoke would be going against the wishes of another minister, Eng Hillary Onek, the Minister for Relief, Disaster Preparedness and Refugees [ who voted yes during age limit bill] who the petitioner says sired two children with her. Rutaana in a one page letter wrote; ‘ ‘ the purported notice contains false, malicious, unfounded and defamatory allegations that I sired a child with the learned Justice Elizabeth Musoke, a reason for which, he is being called upon to recuse from participating in the hearing and determination of the petition’’ 
In the letter, Rutaana denied ever siring a child with Justice Musoke or even ever being in a relationship with her at all He adds; For the above reasons and to save squandering time on useless proceedings challenging the wild allegations, it my humble prayer that considering the conduct exhibited in court when we appeared on both occasions for conferencing and this wild and unfounded allegations, this Honorable court establishes whether, Male Mabirizi Kiwanuka is a fit, sound and proper person to engage in litigation by himself - Advertisement -
