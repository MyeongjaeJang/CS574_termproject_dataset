The deceased neighbour, Isabirye Nabongho, said on Sunday evening, the deceased was seen in Nalubabwe Trading Center buying Ugx. 2,000 worth of petrol. According to the latest Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) report released September last year, by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS), More Ugandans are slipping into poverty with the number of poor people increasing from 6.6 million in 2012/13 to 10 million in 2016/17, 
At the sub-regional level, the survey cited the worst hit regions as Karamoja, with 61 per cent of the people categorised as income poor, followed by Bukedi with 48 per cent and Busoga with 42 per cent. Income poverty means the proportion of Ugandans whose personal income lies below the poverty line, which is $1.25 (about Ugx. 4,500) per day. Those who live on less than $1.25 per day means they cannot afford to meet all their basics needs and cannot afford three meals a day. - Advertisement -
